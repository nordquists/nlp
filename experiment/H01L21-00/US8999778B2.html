Preferably, the CTEs differ by less than about 10%, 5%, 3%, or 1%. As used herein, âpolishâ can mean to lap and polish a surface or to only lap the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Turning to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a method <b>100</b> of providing a semiconductor device, according to a first embodiment. In the same or different embodiments, method <b>100</b> can be considered a method of providing a thin film transistor on a flexible substrate. Method <b>100</b> is merely exemplary and is not limited to the embodiments presented herein. Method <b>100</b> can be employed in many different embodiments or examples not specifically depicted or described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Method <b>100</b> includes a procedure <b>110</b> of providing a flexible substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating procedure <b>110</b> of providing a flexible substrate, according to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Procedure <b>110</b> includes a process <b>211</b> of furnishing a flexible substrate. The term âflexible substrateâ as used herein means a free-standing substrate comprising a flexible material which readily adapts its shape. In some embodiments, process <b>211</b> can include furnishing a flexible substrate with a low elastic modulus. For example, a low elastic modulus can be considered an elastic modulus of less than approximately five GigaPascals (GPa).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In many examples, the flexible substrate is a plastic substrate. For example, flexible substrates can include polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethersulfone (PES), polyimide, polycarbonate, cyclic olefin copolymer, or liquid crystal polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In many examples, the flexible substrate can include a coating at one or more sides of the flexible substrate. The coating can improve the scratch resistance of the flexible substrate and/or help prevent outgassing or oligomer crystallization on the surface of the substrate. Moreover, the coating can planarize the side of the flexible substrate over which it is located. The coating also can help decrease distortion. In some examples, the coating is located only at the side of the flexible substrate where the electrical device will be fabricated. In other examples, the coating is at both sides of the flexible substrate. In various embodiments the flexible substrate can be provided pre-planarized. For example, the flexible substrate can be a PEN substrate from DuPont Teijin Films of Tokyo, Japan, sold under the tradename âplanarized TeonexÂ® Q65.â In other embodiments, a flexible substrate can be planarized after being provided. For example, method <b>2700</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) provides a method of planarizing a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The thickness of the flexible or plastic substrate can be in the range of approximately 25 micrometers (Î¼m) to approximately 300 Î¼m. In the same or different embodiments, the thickness of the flexible or plastic substrate can be in the range of approximately 100 Î¼m to approximately 200 Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In some examples, the flexible substrate can be provided by cutting a sheet of a plastic substrate from a roll of the plastic material using a paper cutter or a pair of ceramic scissors. In various examples, after cutting the plastic substrate, the cut sheet is blown clean with a nitrogen gun. In some embodiments of procedure <b>110</b>, either or both of the cutting and blowing processes can be part of a process <b>212</b>, described below, instead of being part of process <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> continues with process <b>212</b> of preparing the flexible substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating process <b>212</b> of preparing the flexible substrate, according to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can include an activity <b>330</b> of baking the flexible substrate. Baking the flexible substrate can help release oligomers and other chemicals in the flexible substrate that could potentially leach out later during method <b>100</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In some examples, the flexible substrate can be baked using a vacuum bake process. For example, the temperature in an oven containing the flexible substrate can be ramped up over approximately two to three hours to approximately 160 degrees Celsius (Â° C.) to approximately 200Â° C. The flexible substrate can be baked for one hour at approximately 160Â° C. to approximately 200Â° C. and at a pressure of approximately one milliTorr (mTorr) to approximately ten mTorr. Then, the temperature in the oven can be lowered to between approximately 90Â° C. to approximately 115Â° C., and the flexible substrate can be baked for approximately eight more hours. Other baking processes can be also be used. After the baking process is complete, the flexible substrate can be wiped clean of any residues or chemicals that were baked off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Subsequently, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activity <b>331</b> of providing a protective template. The protective template can act as both a guide for the placement of the flexible substrate as well as a protective layer between the flexible substrate and the rollers and/or handling mechanisms of various processing equipment. In some examples, the protective template is a sheet of mylar or any inexpensive plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The protective template can be 50 Î¼m to 15 mm thick and cut to a length of approximately 0.5 m (meters) to approximately 1.5 m. In various embodiments, as part of activity <b>331</b>, the protective template is folded in half and run through rollers (e.g., a hot roll laminator) to help lock in the fold. A line trace of a carrier substrate can also be made on the back side of the protective sheet as part of activity <b>331</b>. Additionally, the protective template can be baked at approximately 90Â° C. to approximately 110Â° C. for approximately five minutes to approximately ten minutes to help flatten the protective template.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> continues with an activity <b>332</b> of applying a protective material to at least a portion of a first surface of the flexible substrate. In some embodiments, a protective material can be applied over at least a portion of a planarized surface of the flexible substrate. In some examples, the protective material is not applied to a portion of the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The protective material prevents scratches and adhesive from covering the planarized surface of the flexible substrate and, thus, reduces defects. In some examples, blue low tack tape (e.g., from Semiconductor Equipment Corporation, part number 18133-7.50) or mylar could be used as the protective material. The protective material can be approximately 25 Î¼m to approximately 100 Î¼m thick. For example, the protective material can be approximately 70 Î¼m thick. In some examples, the protective material is applied by rolling the protective material onto the planarized surface of the flexible substrate using a roller to remove air bubbles between the protective material and the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Subsequently, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activity <b>333</b> of cutting the flexible substrate and protective material into the shape of a wafer. A punch cut template can be used to press the wafer shape into the flexible substrate (with the planarized side, if any, up) and/or the protective material. In one embodiment, the punch cut template is used to create a temporary or permanent impression in the protective material and the flexible substrate at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">If the pressing of the punch cut template cuts completely through the flexible substrate, the flexible substrate is scrapped because the press cut can create cracks in a coating on the flexible substrate that propagate throughout the flexible substrate. After the wafer shape is outlined into the flexible substrate and/or the protective material using the press, the flexible substrate and the protective material are cut simultaneously with each other. In some examples, the flexible substrate and protective material are cut using ceramic scissors approximately one millimeter outside the impression made by the punch cut template.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In some examples, the flexible substrate includes a tab extending from the wafer shape in the flexible substrate and the protective material. The tab can be used to help align the flexible substrate to a carrier substrate when traveling through a laminator in process <b>217</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a top view of a flexible substrate <b>450</b>, according to a first embodiment. Flexible substrate <b>450</b> can include a body <b>452</b> and tab <b>451</b>. In many examples, body <b>452</b> can have a circular shape. Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the protective material is located over flexible substrate <b>450</b> also includes a similarly shaped tab. In one embodiment, the tab is not part of the punch cut template and is cut freehand or freestyle into the flexible substrate and the protective material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> continues with an activity <b>334</b> of cleaning the flexible substrate. In some examples, the second or non-planarized side of the flexible substrate (i.e., the side without the protective material) is dry wiped to remove any oligomers, other chemicals, or particles. Afterwards, the planarized side of the flexible substrate having the protective material is blown clean with a nitrogen gun. In other examples, both sides of are dry wiped and/or blown clean.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Next, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activity <b>335</b> of aligning the flexible substrate with a protective template. In some examples, the flexible substrate having the wafer shape with the tab is aligned with the line trace of a carrier substrate drawn or made on the protective template in activity <b>331</b>. The line trace of the carrier substrate is typically slightly larger than the wafer shape of the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Subsequently, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activity <b>336</b> of coupling the flexible substrate to the protective template. In some embodiments, the flexible substrate is attached to the protective template by attaching a portion of the tab of the flexible substrate to the protective template. For example, a piece of double-sided tape can couple the tab of the flexible substrate to the protective template. In some examples, a portion of the protective material is peeled off of and removed from the tab, and the double-sided tape is coupled to the exposed portion of the tab of the flexible substrate. In some examples, the portion of the protective material can be peeled using tweezers and can be cut from the protective template using a pair of ceramic scissors. In other examples, in activity <b>332</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the protective material is not applied to the portion the tab to which the double-sided tape will be attached so peeling and removal of a portion of the protective material is not necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">After coupling the flexible substrate to the protective coating, the protective template is then folded over the flexible substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of a flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b> after attaching flexible substrate <b>450</b> to a protective template <b>555</b>, according to the first embodiment.

A protective material <b>553</b> is coupled to flexible substrate <b>450</b>, as described previously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In some examples, only one side of the flexible substrate is attached to the protective template. In other examples, both sides of the flexible substrate are attached to the protective template.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Next, process <b>212</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activity <b>337</b> of laminating the flexible substrate, the protective material, and the protective template. The flexible substrate and the protective material are located between the two folded halves of the protective template. The flexible substrate, the protective material, and the protective template can be laminated using a hot roll laminator to remove air bubbles between the protective material and the protective template and also between the protective material and the flexible substrate. In some examples, the flexible substrate and the protective template are placed over a guide sheet (e.g., a LexanÂ® guide sheet) and fed into the hot roll laminator. As an example, the tab of the flexible substrate and the protective material can be fed first into the laminator. The flexible substrate and the protective template are laminated at a pressure of approximately 120 kPa (kilopascals) to approximately 160 kPa and at a temperature of approximately 90Â° C. to approximately 110Â° C. The lamination speed can be approximately one meter per minute to approximately two meters per minute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">After laminating the flexible substrate and protective template, process <b>212</b> is complete. Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a process <b>213</b> of providing a carrier substrate. In many embodiments, the carrier substrate can be a 6, 8, 12, or 18 inch wafer or panel. In some embodiments the carrier substrate can be a panel of approximately 370 mm by 470 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The carrier substrate can include a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface. In some examples, at least one of the first surface and the second surface has been polished. Polishing the surface that is not subsequently coupled to the flexible substrate improves the ability of a vacuum or air chuck to handle the carrier substrate. Also, polishing the surface that is subsequently coupled to the flexible substrate removes topological features of the surface of the carrier substrate that could cause roughness of the flexible substrate assembly in the z-axis after the coupling with the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In various embodiments, the carrier substrate comprises at least one of the following: alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon, low CTE glass, steel, sapphire, barium borosilicate, soda lime silicate, an alkali silicate, or another material that is CTE matched to the flexible substrate. The CTE of the carrier substrate should be matched to the CTE of the flexible substrate. Non-matched CTEs can create stress between the carrier substrate and the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">For example, the carrier substrate could comprise sapphire with a thickness between approximately 0.7 mm and approximately 1.1 mm. The carrier substrate could also comprise 96% alumina with a thickness between approximately 0.7 mm and approximately 1.1 mm. In a different embodiment, the thickness of the 96% alumina is approximately 2.0 mm. In another example, the carrier substrate could be a single crystal silicon wafer with a thickness of at least approximately 0.65 mm. In still a further embodiment, the carrier substrate could comprise stainless steel with a thickness of at least approximately 0.5 mm. In some examples, the carrier substrate is slightly larger than the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Next, procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a process <b>214</b> of providing a cross-linking adhesive. In some examples, the cross-linking adhesive outgases at a rate of less than approximately 2Ã10-4 Torr-liters per second. In some examples, the cross-linking adhesive is thermally and/or UV (ultraviolet) light curable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">In various embodiments, the cross-linking adhesive is a cross-linking acrylic adhesive. In the same or different embodiment, the cross-linking adhesive is a cross-linking pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive or a cross-linking viscoelastic polymer. In some examples, the CTE of the adhesive is very large compared to the CTE of the flexible substrate and the carrier substrate. However, the CTE of the adhesive is not important because the adhesive does not create any stress (i.e., viscoelasticity) between the flexible substrate and carrier substrate because the layer of adhesive is so thin compared to the thickness of the flexible substrate and carrier substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Subsequently, procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a process <b>215</b> of depositing the cross-linking adhesive over a first surface of the carrier substrate. In many embodiments, depositing the cross-linking adhesive over a first surface of the carrier substrate can be performed using at least one of the following methods: spin-coating, spray-coating, extrusion coating, preform lamination, slot die coating, screen lamination, and screen printing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">For example, the carrier substrate can be coated with the cross-linking adhesive. The carrier substrate and the cross-linking adhesive can be spun to distribute the cross-linking adhesive over a first surface of the carrier substrate. In some embodiments, the cross-linking adhesive is spin coated on the carrier substrate by spinning the carrier substrate with the cross-linking adhesive at approximately 900 rpm (revolutions per minute) to 1100 rpm for approximately 20 seconds to approximately 30 seconds and then spinning the carrier substrate with the cross-linking adhesive at approximately 3400 rpm to approximately 3600 rpm for approximately 10 seconds to 30 seconds. In a different embodiment, the carrier substrate with the cross-linking adhesive is spun at approximately 600 rpm to approximately 700 rpm to coat the surface of the carrier substrate and then spun at approximately 3400 rpm to approximately 3600 rpm to control the thickness of the cross-linking adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Prior to spin coating, the cross-linking adhesive can be dispensed onto or over a geometric center of the carrier substrate. In a different embodiment, the cross-linking adhesive can be dispensed onto or over the carrier substrate while the carrier substrate is spinning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The thickness of the cross-linking adhesive over the carrier substrate after the depositing procedure can be between approximately three Î¼m and approximately fifteen Î¼m. In the same or different embodiment, the thickness of the cross-linking adhesive over the carrier substrate after the depositing procedure can be between approximately ten Î¼m and approximately twelve Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> continues with a process <b>216</b> of baking the cross-linking adhesive. In some embodiments, the cross-linking adhesive can be baked to remove solvents. For example, the cross-linking adhesive can be baked at 80Â° C. for thirty minutes and then baked for fifteen minutes at 130Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">In other examples, the cross-linking adhesive is not baked. For example, if the cross-linking adhesive does not include any solvents, a bake is not necessary. Moreover, if the cross-linking adhesive is very viscous, solvents may even be added to the cross-linking adhesive to decrease the viscosity before the adhesive is deposited in process <b>215</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Afterwards, the carrier substrate can be placed on the protective template. The flexible substrate is already coupled to one portion (or half) of the protective template as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the carrier substrate with cross-linking adhesive can be placed on another portion (or half) of the protective template. In some examples, the cross-linking adhesive is still in liquid form at this point. Thus, the carrier substrate coated with the cross-linking adhesive can be stored horizontally for approximately eight to approximately twelve hours before being coupled with the flexible substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Next, procedure <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a process <b>217</b> of coupling the carrier substrate to the flexible substrate using the cross-linking adhesive while both substrates are located between the protective template halves. The second surface of the flexible substrate can be placed over the first surface of the carrier substrate with the adhesive located between the second surface of the flexible substrate and the first surface of the carrier substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In some examples, the carrier substrate is coupled to the flexible substrate using the cross-linking adhesive by laminating the flexible substrate assembly between the protective template halves to remove air bubbles between the carrier substrate and the flexible substrate. Laminating the flexible substrate involves first aligning the carrier substrate with the flexible substrate so that, when laminated, the carrier substrate and the flexible substrate are aligned. Then, the aligned structure can be fed through a hot roll laminator, which can be the same laminator of activity <b>337</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The flexible substrate assembly can be laminated at an approximate speed of 0.4 to 0.6 meters per minute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Also, in various embodiments, the protective material may stick to the protective template when laminated. To avoid this problem, a shield material can be located between the protective template and the protective material before the lamination of activity <b>337</b> and/or activity <b>332</b>. The shield material can be, for example, wax paper. In one embodiment, the shield material is originally coupled to the protective material when acquired from the manufacturer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In the same or different embodiments, some of the cross-linking adhesive can be squeezed out from between the carrier and flexible substrates during lamination and adhere to the first side or the top of the flexible substrate, particularly because the carrier substrate and the overlying cross-linking adhesive layer is slightly larger than the flexible substrate. The presence of the protective material, however, prevents this problem from occurring. The cross-linking adhesive that squeezes out and adheres to the top of the protective material (instead of the flexible substrate) is inconsequential because the protective material is eventually removed and discarded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b> after coupling a carrier substrate <b>651</b> to flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b>, according to the first embodiment.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Referring again back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, procedure <b>110</b> continues with a process <b>218</b> of processing the flexible substrate assembly. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating process <b>218</b> of processing the flexible substrate assembly, according to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Process <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an activity <b>730</b> of cutting the flexible substrate assembly. In some examples, a pair of ceramic scissors is used to cut the protective template and across the alignment tab of the flexible substrate located between the protective template, but the alignment tab is not removed entirely. After cutting the flexible substrate assembly, the protective template can be peeled away from or otherwise removed from the shield material and the carrier substrate by hand. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b> after cutting the flexible substrate assembly and removing the protective template, according to the first embodiment. More specifically, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, protective template <b>555</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 &amp; 6</figref>), and tape <b>556</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 &amp; 6</figref>) of flexible substrate <b>450</b> have been removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the next activity in process <b>218</b> is an activity <b>731</b> of removing the shield material by hand. In some examples, the flexible substrate assembly is placed at an edge of a table with the shield material facing the table. The flexible substrate assembly is slowly moved off the table while the shield layer is removed (e.g., peeled) from the flexible substrate assembly. That is, the shield layer can be removed by pulling the shield material downward away from the edge of the table while the flexible substrate assembly is moved horizontally off the table. In some examples, if the flexible substrate is not properly centered on or otherwise aligned with the carrier substrate after removing the shield layer, the plastic substrate can be slid into alignment with the carrier substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Subsequently, process <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an activity <b>732</b> of removing the alignment tab from the flexible assembly. In some examples, the alignment tab can be cut from the flexible substrate using ceramic scissors. The cut should be made slowly as any movement of the flexible substrate in the z-direction (relative to the carrier substrate) might cause de-lamination of the flexible substrate from the carrier substrate. If de-lamination occurs, the flexible substrate assembly can be re-laminated. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b> after removing the alignment tab, according to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">Next, process <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an activity <b>733</b> of cleaning the flexible substrate assembly. In some examples, the flexible substrate assembly is cleaned with hexanes. The hexanes can be applied by spinning the flexible substrate assembly and spraying the hexanes on the protective material. After the protective material is cleaned, the exposed surface and edge of the carrier substrate is wiped clean with hexanes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Procedure <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> continues with an activity <b>734</b> of curing the cross-linking adhesive. In the same or different embodiment, the cross-linking adhesive is UV cured. For example, the flexible substrate assembly can be exposed to UV light for approximately 15 to 25 seconds and room temperature to cure the cross-linking adhesive. In some embodiments, the cross-linking adhesive can be cured with UV light in the UV light range of approximately 320 nm (nanometers) to approximately 390 nm and with an intensity of approximately 75 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(milliWatts per square centimeter). A Dymax 2000-EC UV Curing Flood Lamp, manufactured by Dymax Corporation of Torrington, Conn., can be used to cure the cross-linking adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In various examples, the cross-linking adhesive is thermally cured during the baking in activity <b>736</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">Subsequently, process <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an activity <b>735</b> of removing the protective material from the flexible substrate assembly. In some examples, the protective material can be slowly removed using tweezers. During the removal process, the protective material is kept as flat as possible to avoid de-laminating the flexible substrate from the carrier substrate. In other examples, the protective material can be releasable by UV light. In these examples, the protective material would lose its tack during a UV light exposure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of flexible substrate assembly <b>540</b> after removing the protective material from the flexible substrate assembly, according to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Next, process <b>218</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an activity <b>736</b> of baking the flexible substrate assembly. Baking the flexible substrate assembly can help decrease the distortion, bow, and warp in the flexible substrate. In some embodiments, baking can also cure the adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In some examples, the flexible substrate assembly can be baked using a vacuum bake process. For example, the temperature in an oven containing the flexible substrate assembly can be ramped up over two to three hours to approximately 160Â° C. to approximately 190Â° C. The flexible substrate assembly can be baked for approximately 50 minutes to 70 minutes at 180Â° C. and with a pressure of approximately 1 mTorr to approximately 10 mTorr. The temperature in the oven can then be lowered to between approximately 90Â° C. to 115Â° C., and the flexible substrate assembly can be baked for approximately seven more hours to approximately nine more hours. Other baking processes can be also be used. After the baking process is complete, the flexible substrate assemblies are cleaned and placed in an oven at approximately 90Â° C. to 110Â° C. for a minimum of approximately two hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">After baking the flexible substrate assembly, process <b>218</b> is complete, and therefore, procedure <b>110</b> is also complete.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">As used in Table 2, etch chemistries refers to etch chemistries that can be used to etch the dielectric material. Etch rate is the minimum etch rate of the dielectric material when using the etch chemistries. Feature size refers to the smallest size of an element or feature formed with the dielectric material. Breakdown voltage is the voltage per length at which the dielectric material begins acting as a conductor. Heat resistance is the lowest temperature that the material can withstand before becoming unstable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an example of process <b>1114</b> of providing a first dielectric material. In various embodiments, the first dielectric material can be a spin-on-dielectric. Accordingly, in these examples, the dielectric can be applied to the semiconductor device by spin-coating the first dielectric material over the first metal layer and various silicon nitride layers. In various embodiments, the application of the first dielectric material can be performed in a Rite Track 8600 available from Rite Track, Inc., of West Chester, Ohio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, process <b>1114</b> can include an activity <b>2330</b> of spinning the semiconductor device at a first predetermined rate. In some examples, the first predetermined spin rate is between approximately 500 rpm and approximately 2000 rpm. In same or different embodiment, the first predetermined rate is approximately 1000 rpm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">Subsequently, process <b>1114</b> can include an activity <b>2331</b> of dispensing the first dielectric material. In some examples, the first dielectric material is dispensed over the substrate while the substrate is spinning at the first predetermined rate. In some examples, the first dielectric material can be dispensed using a syringe. If the substrate is a six inch diameter wafer, approximately 4 mL (milliliters) can be dispensed over the semiconductor device. In some examples, the pressure in the tip of the syringe during dispensing can be approximately 15 kPa. In the same or different embodiment, after the syringe dispenses the first dielectric material, the syringe has suck back pressure of approximately 1 kPa. The suck back pressure of the syringe prevents dripping additional amounts of the first dielectric material from the syringe after the dispensing process is complete. For a 6-in wafer, the dispensing process takes approximately 3 seconds. The semiconductor device is spun at the first predetermined rate until activity <b>2331</b> is complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">In various embodiments, a dynamic dispensing process is used. That is, the substrate is spinning while the first dielectric material is dispensed. In some examples, the first dielectric material is dispensed at the center of the substrate. In other examples, at the beginning of the dispensing process, the syringe is located over the center of the substrate and moves from the center of the substrate to the edge of the substrate at a constant rate of approximately thirty to approximately sixty millimeters per second while the substrate is spinning. In other embodiments, a static dispensing process is used. That is, the substrate is not spun during the dispensing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Next, process <b>1114</b> includes an activity <b>2332</b> of ramping-up the speed of the semiconductor device from the first predetermined rate to a second predetermined rate. In some examples, the second predetermined spin rate is between approximately 2000 rpm and approximately 4000 rpm. In the same or different embodiment, the second predetermined rate is approximately 2600 rpm. Spinning the semiconductor device at the second predetermined rate of approximately 2600 rpm for approximately thirty seconds can distribute the first dielectric material with a thickness of approximately two Î¼m over the surface of the semiconductor device. Different thicknesses of the first dielectric material can be achieved by using different second predetermined rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is an illustration of thickness of the first dielectric material versus the spin rate (i.e., speed) of the semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">Process <b>1114</b> can further include an activity <b>2333</b> of performing edge bead removal. In some examples, during activities <b>2331</b> and <b>2332</b>, the first dielectric material flows outward due to the centrifugal force toward the edge of the substrate and creates a ridge (i.e., the edge bead) on the top side edge of the semiconductor device. The edge bead, when dried, could flake off and increase defects of the semiconductor device and/or damage the manufacturing equipment. Accordingly, the edge bead is removed in activity <b>2333</b>. In some examples, the equipment used in activities <b>2331</b> and <b>2332</b> can include an edge bead removal device. In some examples, a solvent is sprayed on the edge bead to remove the first dielectric material around the edge of the substrate. In some examples, while the semiconductor device is spun at a third predetermined rate, a solvent is sprayed over, for example, approximately five to approximately six millimeters inside the edge of the substrate. In some examples, removing the first dielectric material from the edges of the substrate also helps to ensure that when a second dielectric material is provided over the first dielectric material (process <b>1117</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), the edges of the first dielectric material are capped by a second dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">In some examples, cyclohexanone, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), or other edge bead removing solvents can be used. In some examples, the semiconductor device is rotated at a third predetermined rate of approximately 1000 rpm during the edge bead removal process. In some examples, the semiconductor device is spun at the third predetermined rate for approximately thirty seconds, and solvent is sprayed on the bead edge during this time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Subsequently, process <b>1114</b> continues with an activity <b>2334</b> of stopping the spinning of the semiconductor device. After the spinning of the semiconductor device is stopped, process <b>1114</b> is complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, procedure <b>120</b> includes a process <b>1115</b> of baking the semiconductor device. In some examples, baking the semiconductor device includes baking the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>, the base dielectric material of process <b>1198</b>, the one or more contact elements of process <b>1113</b>, the one or more first semiconductor elements of process <b>1112</b>, and the substrate of procedure <b>110</b>. One of the purposes of the bake is to cause evaporation of the solvents from the edge bead process. Baking the semiconductor device can also increase planarization, decrease film defects, and cross-link the first dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">In various embodiments, the baking of the semiconductor device is performed using a two bake sequence. The baking process can be performed at atmospheric pressure using a hot plate. Process <b>1115</b> can be performed, for example, in a Rite Track 8800.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">The first bake is a bake for approximately sixty seconds at approximately 160Â° C. In an alternative example, the first bake can be an approximately sixty second bake at approximately 150Â° C. After the first bake is complete, in some examples, the semiconductor device is allowed to cool for approximately thirty seconds before the second bake. The semiconductor device can be allowed to cool at room temperature (and not using a chill plate). The semiconductor device is allowed to cool, in these examples, because the handling system uses polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., TeflonÂ® material from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del.) coated chucks to handle the semiconductor device. Placing a hot semiconductor device on the polytetrafluoroethylene coated chuck can damage the chuck. If other equipment is used, the cooling process can possibly be skipped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">After letting the semiconductor device cool, the semiconductor device can be baked for a second time on a hot plate. In some embodiments, the second bake can be for approximately sixty seconds at a temperature greater than approximately 160Â° C. because 160Â° C. is the boiling point of PGMEA. For example, if the first bake was at the 160Â° C., the second bake can be for approximately sixty seconds at approximately 170Â° C. If the first bake was at the 150Â° C., the second bake can be for approximately sixty seconds at approximately 200Â° C. After the second bake is complete, the semiconductor device can be cooled again for thirty seconds. In other embodiments, other sequences of bakes can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">After the baking is complete, the next process in procedure <b>120</b> is a process <b>1116</b> of curing the first dielectric material. Curing of the first dielectric material can improve the cross-linking of the first dielectric material. In some examples, the curing can be performed in a convection oven in a nitrogen atmosphere at atmospheric pressure (i.e., approximately one atmosphere).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">In various examples, the semiconductor device can be placed in the oven. Afterwards, the temperature in the oven can be ramped-up to approximately 200Â° C., and the semiconductor device can be baked for approximately one hour at approximately 200Â° C. The temperature is ramped-up a rate of approximately 1-2Â° C. per minute to minimize outgassing of the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>. After the bake is complete, the temperature is slowly ramped down (e.g., 1-2Â° C. per minute) to room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">In another embodiment, a baking procedure with five separate bakes can be used. The first bake can be a bake at approximately 60Â° C. for approximately ten minutes. The ramp-up time to approximately 60Â° C. from room temperature is approximately ten minutes. After baking at approximately 60Â° C., the temperature is ramped-up over approximately thirty-two minutes to approximately 160Â° C. The semiconductor device is baked for approximately thirty-five minutes at approximately 160Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">The temperature of the convection oven is then increased to approximately 180Â° C. over approximately ten minutes after the 160Â° C. bake. The semiconductor device is baked for approximately twenty minutes at approximately 180Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">After baking at 180Â° C., the temperature is ramped-up over approximately fifty minutes to approximately 200Â° C. The semiconductor device is baked for approximately sixty minutes at approximately 200Â° C. Finally, in this bake procedure, the temperature in the oven is ramped-down to approximately 60Â° C. over approximately seventy minutes. The semiconductor device is baked for approximately ten minutes at approximately 60Â° C. After baking is complete, the semiconductor device is allowed to cool to approximately room temperature before proceeding with procedure <b>120</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The baking of the semiconductor device can help anneal the one or more contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">Subsequently, procedure <b>120</b> includes a process <b>1117</b> of providing a second dielectric material. In some examples, providing the second dielectric material can include depositing the second dielectric material over the organosiloxane dielectric layer (i.e., the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>). In some examples, the second dielectric material can comprise silicon nitride. In the same or different examples, the second dielectric material can include silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), silicon oxide, and/or silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). In some examples, a low temperature PECVD process can be used to deposit the second dielectric material. In some examples, as part of providing the second dielectric material, the first dielectric material is capped by the second dielectric material. In some examples, the edges of the first dielectric material can be capped by the second dielectric material so the first dielectric material is not exposed to any subsequent oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) plasma ashings. Oxygen plasma ashings can degrade the first dielectric material in some examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">The second dielectric material can be deposited with a thickness of approximately 0.1 Î¼m to approximately 0.2 Î¼m. The second dielectric material can be deposited to protect the first dielectric material from later etches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">The next process in procedure <b>120</b> is a process <b>1118</b> of providing a mask over the second dielectric material. The mask applied in process <b>1118</b> can be an etch mask for an etching activity of process <b>1119</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">In some examples, process <b>1118</b> can include applying a patterned photoresist over the siloxane-based dielectric layer (i.e., the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>) or patterning a mask over the organic siloxane-based dielectric (i.e., the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>). Similarly, process <b>1118</b> can include providing a patterned mask over the organosiloxane dielectric layer (i.e., the first dielectric material of process <b>1114</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">In some examples, the mask covers one or more portions of the first dielectric material and the second dielectric material that are not to be etched. The mask can be provided with a thickness such that the mask is not etched through during the etching process of process <b>1119</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In some examples, the mask can have a thickness of approximately 3.5 Î¼m or approximately 2.5 Î¼m to approximately 5.0 Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">In some examples, the mask comprises photoresist. In some examples, the photoresist can be AZ Electronic Materials MiR 900 Photoresist, manufactured by AZ Materials of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. In some examples, the photoresist is coated over the second dielectric material using the Rite Track 8800. For example, the semiconductor device can be vapor primed and spin-coated with the mask (e.g., the photoresist). After coating the semiconductor device, the semiconductor device is baked at approximately 105Â° C. for approximately sixty seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">Next, the semiconductor device is aligned to the correct position with a template and exposed to UV (ultraviolet) light to transfer the mask image from the template to the mask. After exposing the mask, the semiconductor device is baked for approximately ninety seconds at approximately 110Â° C. The mask is then developed using an approximately ninety second puddle with standard development chemicals to remove the portions of the photoresist that were not exposed to the UV light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">After the development is completed, the last portion of providing the mask over the second dielectric material is performing a photoresist reflow process on the mask. Photoresist reflow is the process of heating the mask after the photoresist has been developed to cause the photoresist to become at least semi-liquid and flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In some examples, the semiconductor device is baked at approximately 140Â° C. for approximately sixty seconds. This photoresist reflow process will decrease the sharpness of the edges of the mask, and thus, when etched in process <b>1119</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the vias in the first dielectric and the second dielectric will have sloped sides. In some examples, the sloped sizes are at an angle of approximately thirty degrees from horizontal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">Next, procedure <b>120</b> includes a process <b>1119</b> of etching the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material. The base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material are etched to create vias in the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">In some examples, the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material are etched in the same process using the same etch mask. In other examples, the first dielectric material is etched in a first process, and the second dielectric is etched in a second process, and the base dielectric is etched in a third process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">In these other examples, a mask can be applied to the base dielectric material; the base dielectric material can be etched; and the mask can be removed before the first dielectric material is provided in process <b>1114</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Subsequently, a mask can be applied to the first dielectric material; the first dielectric material can be etched; and the mask can be removed before the second dielectric material is provided in process <b>1118</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Then, a mask can be applied to the second dielectric material, and the second dielectric material can be etched. In another example, the second dielectric material can be etched using the mask of process <b>1118</b>; the mask can be removed; and the patterned second dielectric material can be used as the mask for patterning the first dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">In many embodiments, the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material are plasma etched. In the same of different embodiments, the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material are reactive ion etched (RIE). In some examples, the base dielectric material, the first dielectric material, and the second dielectric material are etched with a fluorine-based etchant. In some examples, the etchant can be trifluoromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), or other fluorine-based etchants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">In some examples where there is no base dielectric material (i.e., process <b>1198</b> is skipped), the first material can be the organosiloxane dielectric material described previously, and the second material can be silicon nitride. In these examples, the first dielectric material and the second dielectric material can be RIE etched with sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) for approximately four minutes. If sulfur hexafluoride is used as the etchant, the etching can be performed in a plasma chamber with a 1:2 ratio of sulfur hexafluoride to oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">The etch rate of the sulfur hexafluoride for the first dielectric material and the second dielectric material are approximately the same (i.e., approximately 0.5 Î¼m per minute). The etch rate of the second dielectric material, however, is marginally greater than the first dielectric material. In some example, the pressure in the plasma chamber during etching is approximately 50 mTorr to approximately 400 mTorr. The RIE etch can be performed in a Tegal 901, manufactured by Tegal Corporation of Petaluma, Calif.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">The second dielectric material can be etched before the first dielectric material; the first dielectric material can be etched before the base dielectric material. In many examples, the metal layer underneath the base dielectric material functions as an etch stop for the etching process. If sulfur hexafluoride is used as the etchant, the metal layer can be aluminum. In this embodiment, the metal layer cannot be molybdenum or tantalum because sulfur hexafluoride etches these two metals. In a different embodiment, the metal layer can include molybdenum and/or tantalum if the etch for the overlying second dielectric layer is a timed etch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">A buffered oxide etch (BOE) and chlorine based etchants cannot be used in some examples because they do not etch the first dielectric material when it comprises an organosiloxane dielectric material. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the device build area of an example of semiconductor device <b>1350</b> after etching etch base dielectric material <b>2499</b>, first dielectric material <b>2461</b> and second dielectric material <b>2462</b>. After process <b>1119</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, semiconductor device <b>1350</b> can include vias <b>2463</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Vias <b>2463</b> are associated with via area <b>2982</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The mask over second dielectric layer <b>2462</b> is not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the next process in procedure <b>120</b> is a process <b>1120</b> of removing the mask. In some examples, the mask is removed by ashing the mask (e.g., the photoresist) at a temperature below 110Â° C. If the mask is ashed at a temperature above 110Â° C., cracking can occur in the first dielectric material. Accordingly, in some examples, ashing of the mask is performed at a temperature in the range of approximately 70Â° C. to approximately 90Â° C. In the same or different example, the ashing of the mask is performed at a temperature in the range of approximately 77Â° C. to approximately 84Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">The ashing can be performed at a pressure of no greater than approximately 300 mTorr. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) can flow through in the chamber during the ashing process at a rate of approximately 50 sccm. In various examples, the ashing procedure can be performed in a Tegal 901. After ashing the mask, the semiconductor device can be rinsed with deionized water and spin dried. In some examples, the rinsing can be performed in a quick dump rinser, and the drying can be performed in a spin rinse dryer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">In other examples, a wet strip can be used to remove the photoresist. In some embodiments, an N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) based stripper can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">The next process in procedure <b>120</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a process <b>1121</b> of providing one or more second semiconductor elements. Examples of one or more second semiconductor elements can include a second metal layer, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, and a silicon nitride layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the device build area of an example of semiconductor device <b>1350</b> after providing a second metal layer <b>2564</b> and an ITO layer <b>2565</b>.

Second metal layer <b>2564</b> can comprise molybdenum and can be approximately 0.15 Î¼m thick. In some examples, second metal layer <b>2564</b> can be deposited by sputtering using a KDF 744.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">ITO layer <b>2565</b> can be deposited over second metal layer <b>2564</b>. ITO layer <b>2565</b> can comprise indium tin oxide and can be approximately 0.05 Î¼m thick. In some examples, ITO layer can be deposited by sputtering using a KDF 744.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">In some examples, second metal layer <b>2564</b> is pattern etched. Then ITO layer <b>2565</b> can be deposited onto second metal layer <b>2564</b> and then pattern etched. As an example, second metal layer <b>2564</b> and ITO layer <b>2565</b> can be etched using an AMAT 8330.</div>

In the same or other examples, silicon nitride layer <b>2666</b> can be etched using a Tegal 901, with ITO layer <b>2565</b> being the stop layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">After process <b>1121</b>, procedure <b>120</b> is complete.
