<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention provides a technique to manufacture a highly reliable semiconductor device and a display device at high yield. As an exposure mask, an exposure mask provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern formed of a semi-transmissive film with a light intensity reducing function is used. With such an exposure mask, various light exposures can be more accurately controlled, which enables a resist to be processed into a more accurate shape. Therefore, when such a mask layer is used, the conductive film and the insulating film can be processed in the same step into different shapes in accordance with desired performances. As a result, thin film transistors with different characteristics, wires in different sizes and shapes, and the like can be manufactured without increasing the number of steps.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Embodiment modes of the invention are described in details with reference to the drawings. Although the present invention will be fully described by way of embodiment modes with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the invention, they should be construed as being included therein. Note that identical portions in embodiment modes are denoted by the same reference numerals and descriptions thereof are not repeated.</div>
<heading>Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A manufacturing method of a thin film transistor of this embodiment mode is described in details with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>. It is to be noted that one thin film transistor is described in this embodiment mode; however, it is needless to say that a plurality of thin film transistors can be formed at the same time on the same substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">An insulating layer <b>301</b> is formed as a base film over a substrate <b>300</b> and a semiconductor layer <b>302</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>301</b>. In this embodiment mode, a crystalline semiconductor layer is used as the semiconductor layer <b>302</b>. A gate insulating layer <b>303</b> is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> and a first conductive film <b>304</b> and a second conductive film <b>305</b> are stacked thereover. In this embodiment mode, a gate electrode layer formed over the gate insulating layer is formed to have a stacked-layer structure; therefore, the first conductive film <b>304</b> and the second conductive film <b>305</b> are stacked. The semiconductor layer <b>302</b> may be doped with a slight amount of impurity element (boron or phosphorus) for controlling a threshold voltage of a thin film transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">A mask layer <b>306</b> is formed for etching the first conductive film <b>304</b> and the second conductive film <b>305</b> into desired shapes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The mask layer <b>306</b> is a resist pattern formed by etching a resist into a desired shape by an exposure mask. The exposure mask used in this embodiment mode is an exposure mask provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern formed of a semi-transmissive film with a light intensity reducing function. The diffraction grating pattern is a pattern provided with at least one opening pattern such as a slit or a dot. When a plurality of openings are provided, the openings may be arranged regularly (periodically) in some order or randomly (non-periodically). By using a fine diffraction grating pattern having an opening with a width of the resolution of an exposure apparatus or narrower and a non-opening, a substantial amount of light exposure can be changed, a thickness of an exposed resist film after development can be controlled, and the resist can be processed into a more precise shape. Therefore, by using such a mask layer, a conductive film and an insulating film can be processed into different shapes in accordance with a desired performance in the same step. As a result, different kinds of thin film transistors, wires in different sizes, and the like can be manufactured without increasing the number of steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The first conductive film <b>304</b> and the second conductive film <b>305</b> are etched by using the mask layer <b>306</b>; thereby the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> are formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The shapes of the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> reflect the shape of the mask layer <b>306</b>. In this embodiment mode, a width of the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> is wider than a width of the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>, and the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> extends to exist outside the side edge portions of the second gate electrode <b>308</b>. By the etching step for forming the gate electrode layer, the gate insulating layer is partially etched (also called film reduction) and becomes thin in some cases. Therefore, in this embodiment mode, by the etching step of the first conductive film <b>304</b> and the second conductive film <b>305</b>, the gate insulating layer <b>303</b> of a region which is not covered with the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> or the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> is partially etched and has a less thickness. For the etching, dry etching, wet etching, or the like can be used. It is to be noted that the mask layer <b>306</b> is also etched in the step of etching the first conductive film and the second conductive film; thereby a mask layer <b>309</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Moreover, the first conductive film <b>304</b> and the second conductive film <b>305</b> can be etched into desired shapes to form wiring layers in the same step as the step of forming the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>. In this case, by using a mask formed of an exposure mask provided with an auxiliary pattern having a light intensity reduction function such as the mask layer <b>306</b> for a wiring layer as well, a wiring layer having a shape which is freely set in accordance with a position or a function can be formed. In order to improve the coverage of an insulating layer or the like to be stacked over the wiring layer, the wiring layer can be formed so as to have a step (or a tapered shape) at edge portions similarly to the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>. Alternatively, the wiring layer can be formed by precisely stacking a first wiring layer and a second wiring layer with approximately the same widths. When the stacked layers have the same widths, wiring capacitance between the stacked layers is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">By introducing an impurity element imparting one conductivity type to the semiconductor layer <b>302</b>, an impurity region is formed. In this embodiment mode, an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity (in this embodiment mode, phosphorus (P)) is used as the impurity element imparting one conductivity type in order to form an n-channel thin film transistor. An impurity element <b>312</b> imparting n-type conductivity is added to the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> provided with the mask layer <b>309</b>, the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b>, and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>; thereby a first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a</i>, a first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b</i>, a second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a</i>, and a second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b </i>are formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Moreover, the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> of a region to which the impurity element <b>312</b> is not added becomes a channel forming region <b>315</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The n-type impurity element <b>312</b> can be added to the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> by using an ion doping method or an ion implanting method. The second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a </i>and the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b </i>formed by adding the impurity element <b>312</b> imparting the n-type conductivity to the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> of a region which is not covered with the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b>, the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>, and the mask layer <b>309</b> correspond to high concentration n-type impurity regions. On the other hand, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a </i>and the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b </i>formed by adding the impurity element <b>312</b> imparting n-type conductivity to the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> through the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> of a region which is not covered with the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> correspond to low concentration n-type impurity regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In this embodiment mode, the gate electrode layer has a stacked-layer structure. By utilizing the different shapes of the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a</i>, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b</i>, the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a</i>, and the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b </i>are formed in a self-aligned manner by adding the impurity element <b>312</b> imparting n-type conductivity once. In this embodiment mode, the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a</i>, the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b</i>, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a</i>, and the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b </i>are formed by performing a step of adding the impurity element once; however, the impurity regions can also be formed by a plurality of steps of adding the impurity element by controlling the thicknesses of the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b>, the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>, and the gate insulating layer <b>303</b> and conditions of adding the impurity element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a </i>and the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b </i>which are high concentration n-type impurity regions function as a source and a drain. On the other hand, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a </i>and the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b </i>which are low concentration n-type impurity regions correspond to LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) regions. In this specification, an impurity region overlapped with a gate electrode layer with a gate insulating layer interposed therebetween is expressed as a Lov region while an impurity region which is not overlapped with a gate electrode layer with a gate insulating layer interposed therebetween is expressed as a Loff region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the impurity regions are expressed by hatching and white, which does not mean that an impurity element is not added to the white portion. They are expressed like this so that it is easily recognized that the concentration distribution of impurity elements in this region reflects conditions of mask or doping. It is to be noted that this is similar in other drawings of this specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> is etched by using the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> as a mask; thereby a first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> reflects a shape of the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> and has a shape in which the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> of regions which extend outside the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> are removed. Therefore, edge portions of the first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> and those of the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> almost correspond to each other. In this embodiment mode, when etching the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b>, the mask layer <b>309</b> is removed. The mask layer <b>309</b> may be removed after forming the first gate electrode layer <b>307</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b>; however, it may be removed in the same step as forming the first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> for simplifying the manufacturing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">As the first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> is formed, the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a </i>and the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b </i>are formed as Loff regions which are not covered with the first gate electrode layer <b>316</b> and the second gate electrode layer <b>308</b> with the gate insulating layer <b>303</b> interposed therebetween. The first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>a </i>or the first n-type impurity region <b>314</b> <i>b </i>formed as a Loff region on a drain side has an effect to alleviate an electric field in the vicinity of the drain to prevent deterioration caused by hot carrier injection and to reduce an off current. As a result, a semiconductor device with high reliability and low power consumption can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">A wiring layer (also called a source electrode layer or a drain electrode layer, not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>) electrically connected to the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>a </i>and the second n-type impurity region <b>313</b> <i>b </i>which function as a source region and a drain region is formed, thereby an n-channel thin film transistor is manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Normally, when forming impurity regions with different concentrations in the semiconductor layer in a non-self-aligned manner, desired length and area of the impurity regions cannot be obtained in some cases because of misalignment in processing a mask layer used when forming the impurity region. When the desired impurity region is not formed, desired device characteristics of the thin film transistor cannot be obtained. Moreover, the device characteristics of a plurality of thin film transistors vary. Therefore, the reliability of the obtained semiconductor device is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Further, when the mask layer <b>309</b> is removed, the semiconductor layer <b>302</b> cannot be protected from doping of impurity elements in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">By the invention, a highly reliable semiconductor device can be manufactured through simplified steps.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">As an example of another exposure mask, an exposure mask provided with a diffraction grating pattern with a plurality of slits between the shielding portions may be used. A diffraction grating pattern is a pattern provided with at least one opening pattern such as a slit, a dot, or the like.

By using a diffraction grating pattern having an opening (space) with a fine width of the resolution of an exposure apparatus or narrower and a non-opening (line), a substantial amount of light exposure can be changed and a thickness of an exposed resist film after development can be controlled. The resolution is the narrowest possible width formed by the exposure apparatus. In a projection exposure apparatus, a resolution R is expressed as R=Kλ/NA. K is a constant, λ is a wavelength of light used for exposure, and NA is the number of openings of the projection lens. Therefore, when the resist film is processed by the method shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, the resist film can be selectively processed finely without increasing the number of steps; thereby various resist patterns (mask layers) can be obtained.

Alternatively, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or a derivative thereof, a heat-resistant high molecular compound such as polyimide, aromatic polyamide, or polybenzimidazole, or a siloxane resin may be used. Note that the siloxane resin corresponds to a resin containing a Si—O—Si bond. The skeletal structure of siloxane is constituted by a bond of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O). As a substituent, an organic group containing at least hydrogen (for example, an alkyl group or an aromatic hydrocarbon) is used. As the substituent, a fluoro group may also be used. Alternatively, an organic group containing at least hydrogen, and a fluoro group may be used as the substituent. Further, a vinyl resin such as polyvinyl alcohol, or polyvinyl butyral; or a resin material such as epoxy resin, phenol resin, novolac resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin, or urethane resin is used.

Further, an oxazole resin can also be used, for example, a photosensitive polybenzoxazole or the like can be used. A photosensitive polybenzoxazole has a low dielectric constant (a dielectric constant of 2.9 at 1 MHz and a normal temperature), high heat resistance (TGA: Thermal Gravity Analysis) thermal decomposition temperature of 550° C. with the rise in temperature at 5° C./min), and a low moisture absorbing rate (0.3% in 24 hours at a normal temperature). It is to be noted that the moisture absorbing rate is expressed in a percentage of a ratio of the weight increase to the original weight after soaking a sample of a certain size in distilled water for some period of time.</div>

As a plastic substrate, a substrate formed of PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN (polyethylene naphthalate), or PES (polyether sulfone) may be used, and as a flexible substrate, a synthetic resin such as acrylic can be used. Since the display device manufactured in the present embodiment mode has a structure in which light from the light-emitting element is emitted through the substrate <b>100</b>, the substrate <b>100</b> is required to have a light transmissive property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The base film can be formed of a single layer or a stacked-layer structure of as two or three layers of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, or the like. Note that in this specification, silicon oxynitride means a substance where the composition ratio of oxygen is higher than that of nitrogen, which can also be referred to as silicon oxide containing nitrogen. Meanwhile, silicon nitride oxide means a substance where the composition ratio of nitrogen is higher than that of oxygen, which can also be referred to as silicon nitride containing oxygen. In this embodiment, a silicon nitride oxide film with a thickness of 50 nm is formed over the substrate with SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2 </sub>used as a reaction gas, and a silicon oxynitride film with a thickness of 100 nm is formed with SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O used as a reaction gas. Alternatively, a silicon nitride oxide film with a thickness of 140 nm and a silicon oxynitride film with a thickness of 100 nm may be stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Subsequently, a semiconductor film is formed over the base films. The semiconductor film may be formed by a known method (a sputtering method, an LPCVD method, a plasma CVD method, or the like) to have a thickness of 25 to 200 nm (preferably, 30 to 150 nm). In this embodiment mode, the semiconductor film is preferably formed of a crystalline semiconductor film that is obtained by laser crystallization of an amorphous semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">The semiconductor film may be formed of an amorphous semiconductor (hereinafter also referred to as AS) that is formed by a vapor deposition method or a sputtering method using a semiconductor material gas typified by silane and germane; a polycrystalline semiconductor that is obtained by crystallizing the amorphous semiconductor utilizing optical energy or heat energy; a semi-amorphous semiconductor (also called microcrystal, hereinafter also referred to as SAS), or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">SAS is a semiconductor having an intermediate structure between amorphous and crystalline (including single crystalline and polycrystalline) structures. This semiconductor has a third state that is stable in free energy, and it includes a crystalline region that has a short range order and a lattice distortion. SAS is obtained by glow discharge decomposition (plasma CVD) of gas containing silicon. As the gas containing silicon, not only SiH4 but also Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, SiHCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>4</sub>, or the like may be used. In addition, F<sub>2 </sub>or GeF<sub>4 </sub>may be mixed into the gas. The gas containing silicon may be diluted with H<sub>2 </sub>or H<sub>2 </sub>and one or more kinds of rare gas elements selected from He, Ar, Kr, and Ne. When a rare gas element such as helium, argon, krypton, and neon is mixed into SAS, the lattice distortion is further increased and the stability is thus enhanced, leading to a high quality SAS. Alternatively, as the semiconductor film, an SAS layer formed of a fluorine-based gas and an SAS layer made of a hydrogen-based gas may be stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">An amorphous semiconductor is typified by hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and a crystalline semiconductor is typified by polysilicon. Polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon) includes a so-called high temperature polysilicon that mainly uses polysilicon formed at a process temperature of 800° C. or higher, a so-called low temperature polysilicon that mainly uses polysilicon formed at a process temperature of 600° C. or lower, a polysilicon that is obtained by crystallization after adding an element for promoting crystallization, and the like. Needless to say, a semi-amorphous semiconductor or a semiconductor partially including a crystalline phase may also be used as set forth above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">When a crystalline semiconductor film is formed as the semiconductor film, the crystalline semiconductor film may be formed by a known method (laser crystallization, thermal crystallization, thermal crystallization using an element for promoting crystallization such as nickel, or the like). Alternatively, a microcrystalline semiconductor that is an SAS may be irradiated with a laser to be crystallized, thereby increasing the crystallinity. If an element for promoting crystallization is not introduced, an amorphous semiconductor film is heated at 500° C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere before being irradiated with a laser beam, so that hydrogen included in the amorphous semiconductor film may be released to lower the hydrogen concentration to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower. This is performed because the amorphous semiconductor film is damaged when the film containing much hydrogen is irradiated with laser. The heat treatment for crystallization may be performed using a heating furnace, laser irradiation, irradiation with light emitted from a lamp (hereinafter also referred to as lamp annealing), or the like. The heat treatment may also be performed by RTA such as GRTA (Gas Rapid Thermal Annealing) and LRTA (Lamp Rapid Thermal Annealing). The GRTA is heat treatment using a high temperature gas, and the LRTA is heat treatment using lamp light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">In the step of forming a crystalline semiconductor layer by crystallizing an amorphous semiconductor layer, an element (also called a catalyst element or a metal element) which promotes crystallization may be added to the amorphous semiconductor layer and crystallization may be performed by heat treatment (3 minutes to 24 hours at 550 to 750° C.). One or a plurality selected from iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), and gold (Au) can be used as a metal element which promotes crystallization of silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">A metal element may be introduced to the amorphous semiconductor film by any method as long as the metal element can exist on the surface or inside of the amorphous semiconductor film, and for example, sputtering, CVD, plasma treatment (including plasma CVD), adsorption, or a method for applying a metal salt solution can be used. Among them, the method using a solution is simple, and is effective in easily adjusting the concentration of the metal element. Further, at this time, an oxide film is desirably formed by UV ray irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere, thermal oxidation, treatment with ozone water or hydrogen peroxide including hydroxyl radical, or the like in order to improve the wettability of the surface of the amorphous semiconductor film and to spread the water solution over the entire surface of the amorphous semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">In order to remove or reduce the element which promotes crystallization from the crystalline semiconductor layer, a semiconductor layer containing an impurity element is formed in contact with the crystalline semiconductor layer and used as a gettering sink. The impurity element may be an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity, an impurity element imparting p-type conductivity, a rare gas element, or the like. For example, one or a plurality of elements selected from phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), boron (B), helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe) can be used. A semiconductor layer containing a rare gas element is formed in a crystalline semiconductor layer containing an element which promotes crystallization, and thermal treatment is performed (3 minutes to 24 hours at 550 to 750° C.). The element which promotes crystallization contained in the crystalline semiconductor layer moves into the semiconductor layer containing a rare gas element. The element which promotes crystallization contained in the crystalline semiconductor layer is removed or reduced. After that, the semiconductor layer containing a rare gas element which is a gettering sink is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">By scanning such laser and the semiconductor film relatively, laser irradiation can be performed. Further, in the laser irradiation, a marker may be formed to overlap beams with high precision and control positions for starting and finishing laser irradiation. The marker may be formed over the substrate at the same time when an amorphous semiconductor film is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">In the case of laser irradiation, a continuous wave laser beam (CW laser beam) or a pulsed wave laser beam (pulsed laser beam) can be used. As the laser beam, a laser beam oscillated from one or a plurality selected from a gas laser such as Ar laser, Kr laser, and excimer laser, a single crystal of YAG laser, YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser, forstelite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), YLF laser, YAlO<sub>3 </sub>laser, GdVO<sub>4 </sub>laser, or a polycrystal (ceramic) of YAG, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, YVO<sub>4</sub>, YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4 </sub>doped with one or more kinds of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Er, Tm, and Ta as a dopant, glass laser, ruby laser, alexandrite laser, Ti: sapphire laser, copper vapor laser, and gold vapor laser can be used. By emitting a laser beam of second to fourth wave of a fundamental wave in addition to a fundamental harmonic of the foregoing laser beams, a crystal having a large grain diameter can be obtained. For instance, a second harmonic (532 nm) or a third harmonic (355 nm) of Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser (fundamental, 1064 nm) can be used. This laser can be emitted by CW or pulsed oscillation. In the case of CW, the laser requires power density of approximately from 0.01 to 100 MW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(preferably, approximately from 0.1 to 10 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>). The laser is emitted at a scanning rate of approximately 10 to 2000 cm/sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Note that, a laser using, as a medium, single crystal of YAG, YVO<sub>4</sub>, forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4 </sub>or polycrystal (ceramic) of YAG; Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, YVO<sub>4</sub>, YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4 </sub>doped with one or more of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Er, Tm, and Ta as a dopant; an Ar ion laser; or a Ti:sapphire laser can be continuously oscillated. Further, pulse oscillation thereof can be performed with an oscillation frequency of 10 MHz or more by carrying out Q switch operation, mode synchronization, or the like. When a laser beam is oscillated with a repetition rate of 10 MHz or more, a semiconductor film is irradiated with a next pulse during the semiconductor film is melted by the laser beam and then is solidified. Therefore, differing from a case of using a pulse laser with a low repetition rate, a solid-liquid interface can be continuously moved in the semiconductor film so that crystal grains, which continuously grow toward a scanning direction, can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">When ceramic (polycrystal) is used as a medium, the medium can be formed to have a free shape for short time at low cost. When using a single crystal, a columnar medium with several mm in diameter and several tens of mm in length is usually used. In the case of using the ceramic, a medium bigger than the case of using the single crystal can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">A concentration of a dopant such as Nd or Yb in a medium, which directly contributes to light emission, cannot be changed largely in both cases of the single crystal and the polycrystal; therefore, there is a limit in improvement in output of a laser by increasing the concentration to some extent. However, in the case of the ceramic, the size of a medium can be significantly increased as compared with the case of the single crystal, and therefore, drastic improvement in output of a laser can be expected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Further, in the case of the ceramic, a medium with a parallel six-hedron shape or a cuboid shape can be easily formed. In a case of using a medium having such a shape, when oscillated light is made travel in zigzag inside of the medium, a long path of the oscillated light can be obtained. Therefore, amplitude is increased and a laser beam can be oscillated at high output. Furthermore, a cross sectional shape of a laser beam emitted from a medium having such a shape is a quadrangular shape, and therefore, as compared with a laser beam with a circular shape, the laser beam with the quadrangular shape in cross section have an advantage to be shaped into a linear beam. By shaping a laser beam emitted in the above described manner using an optical system, a linear beam with 1 mm or less in length of a short side and several mm to several m in length of a long side can be easily obtained. In addition, when a medium is uniformly irradiated with excited light, a linear beam is emitted with a uniform energy distribution in a long side direction. Further, it is preferable that a semiconductor film be irradiated with laser at an incident angle θ (0&lt;θ&lt;90°); thereby an interference of the laser can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">By irradiating the semiconductor film with this linear beam, the entire surface of the semiconductor film can be more evenly annealed. When the linear beam is required to be even to the opposite ends, slits are provided at the opposite ends to shield light of energy attenuation portions or other measures are required to be taken.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">The semiconductor film obtained in this manner is annealed with the linear beam having uniform intensity, and a semiconductor device is manufactured by using the semiconductor film. Then, the characteristic of the semiconductor device can be favorable and uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Further, the semiconductor film may be irradiated with the laser beam in the atmosphere of an inert gas such as a rare gas or nitrogen. Accordingly, roughness of the surface of the semiconductor can be suppressed by an irradiation of the laser beam, and variation of a threshold value generated by variation of interface state density can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">An amorphous semiconductor film may be crystallized by the combination of thermal treatment and laser light irradiation, or one of thermal treatment and laser light irradiation may be performed a plurality of times.</div>

In this embodiment mode, the base film <b>101</b> <i>a</i>, the base film <b>101</b> <i>b</i>, and the amorphous semiconductor film are continuously formed by changing a reaction gas without breaking the vacuum in the same chamber at the same temperature of 330° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">After removing an oxide film formed over the amorphous semiconductor film, an oxide film is formed with a thickness of 1 to 5 nm by UV light irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere, a thermal oxidization method, treatment with ozone water or hydrogen peroxide including hydroxyl radical, or the like. In this embodiment mode, Ni is used as an element for promoting crystallization. An aqueous solution containing 10 ppm of Ni acetate is applied by a spin coating method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">In this embodiment mode, after performing thermal treatment at 750° for 3 minutes by an RTA method, the oxide film formed over the semiconductor film is removed and laser light irradiation is applied. The amorphous semiconductor film is crystallized by the aforementioned crystallization treatment to be a crystalline semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">In the case of performing crystallization using a metal element, a gettering step is performed for reducing or removing the metal element. In this embodiment mode, the metal element is captured using the amorphous semiconductor film as a gettering sink. First, an oxide film is formed over the crystalline semiconductor film by UV light irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere, a thermal oxidation method, treatment with ozone water or hydrogen peroxide including hydroxyl radical, or the like. It is desirable that the oxide film be formed thicker by heat treatment. Subsequently, an amorphous semiconductor film is formed with a thickness of 50 nm by a plasma CVD method (with a condition of this embodiment mode as 350 W, 35 Pa, deposition gas: SiH<sub>4 </sub>(flow rate of 5 sccm) and Ar (flow rate 1000 sccm)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">After that, thermal treatment is performed at 744° C. for three minutes by an RTA method to reduce or remove the metal element. The thermal treatment may be performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the amorphous semiconductor film as a gettering sink and an oxide film formed over the amorphous semiconductor film are removed with hydrofluoric acid and the like, thereby a crystalline semiconductor film <b>102</b> in which the metal element is reduced or removed can be obtained (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). In this embodiment mode, the amorphous semiconductor film as a gettering sink is removed using TMAH (Tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">The semiconductor film obtained in this manner may be doped with a slight amount of impurity element (boron or phosphorus) for controlling a threshold voltage of a thin film transistor. This doping of impurity element may be performed to an amorphous semiconductor film before a crystallization step.

Further, a defect and the like generated at the doping can be improved as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">Subsequently, the crystalline semiconductor film <b>102</b> is processed into a desired shape. In this embodiment mode, after removing the oxide film formed over the crystalline semiconductor film <b>102</b>, an oxide film is newly formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">An etching process may adopt either plasma etching (dry etching) or wet etching. However, in the case of processing a large area substrate, plasma etching is suitable. As an etching gas, a gas containing fluorine such as CF<sub>4 </sub>and NF<sub>3 </sub>or a gas containing chlorine such as Cl<sub>2 </sub>and BCl<sub>3 </sub>is used, to which an inert gas such as He and Ar may be appropriately added. Further, in the case of applying an etching process by atmospheric pressure discharge, local discharge can be realized, thereby a mask layer is not required to be formed over an entire surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">In the invention, a conductive layer for forming a wiring layer or an electrode layer, a mask layer for forming a predetermined pattern, or the like may be formed by a method where a pattern can be selectively formed such as a droplet discharge method. In the droplet discharge (ejecting) method (also referred to as an inkjet method depending on the system thereof), a predetermined pattern (a conductive layer, an insulating layer, and the like) can be formed by selectively discharging (ejecting) droplets of a composition prepared for a specific purpose. At this time, a process for controlling wettability and adhesion may be performed to a region for forming a pattern.

As a method for forming the thin silicon oxide film, the surface of the semiconductor region is oxidized by a GRTA method, an LRTA method, or the like to form a thermal oxide film is formed, thereby a silicon oxide film with a thin thickness can be formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">The insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> can be formed of a material selected from silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum nitride (AlN), aluminum oxide containing nitrogen (also called aluminum oxynitride) (AlON), aluminum nitride containing oxygen (also called aluminum nitride oxide) (AlNO), aluminum oxide, diamond-like carbon (DLC), a nitrogen-containing carbon film (CN), PSG (phosphosilicate glass), BPSG (borophosphosilicate glass), an alumina film, or other substances containing an inorganic insulating material. Alternatively, siloxane resin may also be used. Further, an organic insulating material may be used, which may be a photosensitive type or a non-photosensitive type, such as polyimide, acrylic, polyamide, polyimide amide, resist, benzocyclobutene, polysilazane, or a low dielectric constant (Low-k) material. Moreover, oxazole resin can also be used, which is, for example, photosensitive polybenzoxazole. Photosensitive polybenzoxazole has a low dielectric constant (a dielectric constant of 2.9 at a normal temperature at 1 MHz), high heat resistance (TGA: Thermal Gravity Analysis) thermal decomposition temperature of 550° C. with the rise in temperature at 5° C./min), and low moisture absorbing rate (0.3% in 24 hours at a normal temperature).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">An interlayer insulating layer provided for planarization is required to be high in heat resistance, an insulating property, and a planarizing property. Therefore, a coating method typified by a spin coating method is preferably used for forming the insulating film <b>181</b>. In this embodiment mode, the insulating film <b>181</b> is formed of a coated film using a siloxane resin material while the insulating film <b>182</b> is formed of a silicon nitride oxide film by a CVD method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">The insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> can be formed by a dipping method, spray coating, a doctor knife, a roll coater, a curtain coater, a knife coater, a CVD method, a vapor deposition method, or the like. The insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> may be formed by a droplet discharge method. In the case of using a droplet discharge method, a material solution can be used economically. Moreover, a method enabling a pattern to be transferred or drawn such as a droplet discharge method, for example, a printing method (a method to form a pattern such as screen printing or offset printing) can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, openings are formed in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> which are interlayer insulating layers.

The connecting region <b>205</b> is a region shown in the top plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, where a wiring layer manufactured in the same step as the source electrode layer or the drain electrode layer and a second electrode layer which later functions as an upper electrode layer of a light emitting element are electrically connected. The connecting region <b>205</b> is omitted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Therefore, an opening is required to be formed in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> in the connecting region <b>205</b> as well. However, the opening area of the pixel region <b>206</b> is much smaller and finer than the opening area of the peripheral driver circuit region <b>204</b> or the like. Therefore, a margin of the etching conditions can be expanded by providing a photolithography step for forming the opening in the pixel region and a photolithography step for forming an opening in the connecting region. As a result, yield can be improved. Moreover, when the margin of etching conditions is expanded, a contact hole can be formed in the pixel region at high precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">In specific, an opening of a wide area is formed in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> provided in the connecting region <b>205</b>, the peripheral driver circuit region <b>204</b>, the wiring region <b>203</b>, the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>, and the separating region <b>201</b>. For forming the opening, a mask is formed to cover the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> in the non-opening region in the pixel region <b>206</b>, the connecting region <b>205</b>, the peripheral driver circuit region <b>204</b>, the wiring region <b>203</b>, and the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>. A parallel plate RIE apparatus or an ICP etching apparatus can be used for etching. Etching is preferably performed until the wiring layer or the insulating film <b>168</b> is over-etched. By over-etching the films in this manner, variations in film thickness and etching rate in the substrate can be reduced. In this manner, openings are formed in the connecting region <b>205</b>, the peripheral driver circuit region <b>204</b>, the wiring region <b>203</b>, the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>, and the separating region <b>201</b>. An opening <b>183</b> is formed in the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>, thereby a terminal electrode layer <b>178</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">After that, a fine opening, which is a contact hole, is formed in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> of the pixel region <b>206</b>. At this time, a mask is formed to cover the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> in the non-opening region of the pixel region <b>206</b>, and the connecting region <b>205</b>, the peripheral driver circuit region <b>204</b>, the wiring region <b>203</b>, and the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>. The mask is used for forming the opening in the pixel region <b>206</b> and is provided with a fine opening at a predetermined position. As such a mask, for example, a resist mask can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">By using the parallel plate RIE apparatus, the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> are etched. It is to be noted that etching is preferably performed until the wiring layer and the insulating film <b>168</b> are over-etched.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">Moreover, an ICP apparatus may also be used as the etching apparatus. By the aforementioned steps, an opening <b>184</b> to reach the source electrode layer or drain electrode layer <b>172</b> <i>b </i>is formed in the pixel region <b>206</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">Etching for forming the opening may be performed a plurality of times at the same position. For example, the opening in the connecting region <b>205</b> having a wide area requires to be etched a lot. Such a wide area opening may be formed by performing etching a plurality of times. Moreover, etching may be similarly performed a plurality of times in the case of forming an opening deeper than other openings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">In this embodiment mode, the openings are formed in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> with a plurality of steps separately; however, they may be formed by one etching step as well. In this case, etching is performed with an ICP power of 7000 W, a bias power of 1000 W, and a pressure of 0.8 Pascal (Pa), using an etching gas including 2400 sccm of CF<sub>4 </sub>and 160 sccm of O<sub>2 </sub>by using an ICP apparatus. A bias power is preferably 1000 to 4000 W. The openings are formed by one etching step; therefore, it is advantageous in that the manufacturing steps can be simplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">In the case of forming all the openings in the insulating films <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> in one step, it is preferable to use a mask layer formed of an exposure mask provided with a diffraction grating pattern or an auxiliary pattern formed of a semi-transmissive film having a light intensity reducing function. With such an exposure mask, a mask layer having regions with different thicknesses can be formed. That is, it is possible to form a mask layer thick in a region where the opening is shallow such as the opening <b>184</b> and form a mask layer thin in a region where the opening is deep such as the opening <b>183</b>. When a mask layer having a gradient in thickness by the desired depth of etching is used, different depths of etching can be performed by one etching step. Therefore, in the shallow opening, as exposed wiring layer or the like is not exposed to etching treatment for a long time, damage to the wiring layer by a lot of over-etching can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">Next, a first electrode layer <b>185</b> (also called a pixel electrode layer) is formed so as to contact the source electrode layer or the drain electrode layer <b>172</b> <i>b</i>.

In this embodiment mode, by forming a transparent conductive film in a desired shape over the insulating film <b>182</b>, the insulating film <b>182</b> functions as an etching stopper as well when the first electrode layer <b>185</b> is etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">In the invention, a transparent conductive film formed of a conductive material having light transmittance is preferably used in the first electrode layer <b>185</b> as a light transmissive electrode layer, for which indium oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium zinc oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium oxide containing titanium oxide, indium tin oxide containing titanium oxide, or the like can be used. It is needless to say that indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium tin oxide to which silicon oxide is added (ITSO), or the like can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">An example of composition ratio of a conductive material having light transmissivity is described.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">Further, when a material such as a metal film having no light transmissivity is formed thin (preferably a thickness of about 5 to 30 nm) so as to be able to transmit light, light can be emitted from the first electrode <b>185</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">The first electrode layer <b>185</b> may be cleaned by a polyvinyl alcohol-based porous body or polished by a CMP method so as to planarize the surface.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">After forming the first electrode layer <b>185</b>, thermal treatment may be performed. By this thermal treatment, moisture contained in the first electrode layer <b>185</b> is discharged. Therefore, as the first electrode layer <b>185</b> does not generate degasification or the like, even when a light emitting material which easily deteriorates due to moisture is formed over the first electrode layer <b>185</b>, the light emitting material does not deteriorate. As a result, a highly reliable display device can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">Next, an insulating layer <b>186</b> (called a partition, a barrier, or the like) is formed to cover an edge portion of the first electrode layer <b>185</b> and the source electrode layer or the drain electrode layer (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Moreover, in the same step, insulating layers <b>187</b> <i>a </i>and <b>187</b> <i>b </i>are formed in the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">When the selection ratio between the first electrode layer <b>185</b> and the insulating layer <b>186</b> is high, the first electrode layer <b>185</b> functions as an etching stopper when forming the insulating layer <b>186</b> functioning as a partition covering a portion of the first electrode layer <b>185</b> by etching into a desired shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">The insulating layer <b>186</b> can be formed of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxynitride, other inorganic insulating materials, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, a derivative of these, heat resistant high molecular material such as polyimide, aromatic polyamide, or polybenzimidazole, or siloxane resin. The insulating layer <b>186</b> may be formed of a photosensitive or non-photosensitive material such as acrylic and polyimide. Moreover, oxazole resin can also be used, which is, for example, photosensitive polybenzoxazole. Photosensitive polybenzoxazole has a low dielectric constant (a dielectric constant of 2.9 at a normal temperature at 1 MHz), high heat resistance (TGA: Thermal Gravity Analysis) thermal decomposition temperature of 550° C. with the rise in temperature at 5° C./min), and a low moisture absorbing rate (0.3% in 24 hours at a normal temperature). The insulating layer <b>186</b> preferably has a shape with a continuously changing curvature radius, thereby an electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> and a second electrode layer <b>189</b> can have improved coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">In the connecting region <b>205</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a wiring layer formed of the same material and in the same step as the second electrode layer is electrically connected to a wiring layer formed of the same material and in the same step as the gate electrode layer. For this connection, an opening to expose the wiring layer formed of the same material in the same step as the gate electrode layer is formed. By covering a step in the periphery of the opening with the insulating layer <b>186</b> so as to smooth the step, the coverage of the second electrode layer <b>189</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">Further, in order to further improve the reliability, it is preferable to perform degasification by vacuum heating before forming the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b>. For example, before performing evaporation of an organic compound material, it is preferable to perform thermal treatment in a reduced pressure atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere at 200 to 400° C., or preferably 250 to 350° C. in order to remove gas contained in the substrate. Moreover, it is preferable to form the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> by a vacuum vapor deposition method or a droplet discharge method at a reduced pressure without exposing the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> to air. By this thermal treatment, moisture contained and attached to the conductive layer as the first electrode layer and the insulating layer (partition) can be discharged. This thermal treatment may include the prior heating step if the substrate can be carried through the vacuum chambers without breaking the vacuum, in which case the prior heating step may be performed once after the insulating layer (partition) is formed. Here, when the interlayer insulating film and the insulating layer (partition) are formed of a highly heat resistant substance, the thermal treatment step can be sufficiently performed to improve the reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">The electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> is formed over the first electrode layer <b>185</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">A material (a low or high molecular material or the like) which exhibits light emission of red (R), green (G), or blue (B) can also be formed by a droplet discharge method.</div>

In this manner, a light emitting element <b>190</b> formed of the first electrode layer <b>185</b>, the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b>, and the second electrode layer <b>189</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">In the display device of this embodiment mode shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the light emitted from the light emitting element <b>190</b> is emitted from the first electrode layer <b>185</b> side and passes through in a direction of an arrow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">In this embodiment mode, an insulating layer may be provided as a passivation film (protective film) over the second electrode layer <b>189</b>. It is effective to provide a passivation film so as to cover the second electrode layer <b>189</b> in this manner. As the passivation film, an insulating film containing silicon nitride, silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride (SiON), silicon nitride oxide (SiNO), aluminum nitride (AlN), aluminum oxynitride (AlON), aluminum nitride oxide containing nitrogen more than oxygen (AlNO), aluminum oxide, diamond-like carbon (DLC), or a nitrogen-containing carbon film (CN) can be used as a single layer or in combination as stacked layers. Alternatively, siloxane resin can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">At this time, it is preferable to use a film having favorable coverage as a passivation film, such as a carbon film. In particular, a DLC film is effectively used. A DLC film can be formed at a temperature range of a room temperature to 100° C.; therefore, it can be easily formed over the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> with low heat resistance as well. The DLC film can be formed by a plasma CVD method (typically an RF plasma CVD method, a microwave CVD method, an electron cyclotron resonant (ECR) CVD method, a thermal filament CVD method, or the like), a combustion method, a sputtering method, an ion beam vapor deposition method, a laser vapor deposition method, or the like. A reaction gas used for forming the DLC film is a hydrogen gas and a hydrocarbon-based gas (for example, CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, or the like), which are ionized by glow discharging, and thus generated ions are accelerated to collide with a negatively self-biased cathode, thereby the DLC film is formed. Moreover, the CN film is preferably formed by using a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4 </sub>gas and a N<sub>2 </sub>gas as reaction gases. The DLC film has a high blocking effect against oxygen and can suppress the oxidization of the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b>. Therefore, a problem can be prevented in that the electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> is oxidized during a subsequent sealing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">In this manner, the substrate <b>100</b> over which the light emitting element <b>190</b> is formed and a sealing substrate <b>195</b> are fixed to each other by a sealing material <b>192</b>, thereby the light emitting element is sealed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>). In the display device of the invention, the sealing material <b>192</b> and the insulating layer <b>186</b> are formed apart from each other so as not to have a contact. When the sealing material and the insulating layer <b>186</b> are formed apart from each other in this manner, moisture does not easily enter even when using an insulating material formed of an organic material having a high moisture absorbing property for the insulating layer <b>186</b>. Thus, deterioration of a light emitting element can be prevented and reliability of a display device is improved. As the sealing material <b>192</b>, it is preferable to use visible light curable, ultraviolet curable, or heat curable resin representatively. For example, epoxy resin such as bisphenol A type liquid resin, bisphenol A type solid resin, bromine epoxy resin, bisphenol F type resin, bisphenol AD type resin, phenol resin, cresol resin, novolac resin, cyclic aliphatic epoxy resin, epi-bis epoxy resin, glycidyl ester based resin, glycidyl amine based resin, heterocyclic epoxy resin, or modified epoxy resin can be used. It is to be noted that a region surrounded by the sealing material may be filled with a filling material <b>193</b>. Alternatively, the filling material <b>193</b> may fill a region with nitrogen or the like by sealing the substrates in a nitrogen atmosphere. As a bottom emission type is employed in this embodiment mode, the filling material <b>193</b> is not required to have light transmissivity. However, in the case of extracting light through the filling material <b>193</b>, the filling material <b>193</b> is required to have light transmissivity. Typically, visible light, ultraviolet ray, or heat curable epoxy resin is preferably used. By the aforementioned steps, a display device having a display function using a light emitting element in this embodiment mode is completed. The filling material can be dropped in a liquid state so as to be filled in the display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">A drop filling method using a dispenser method is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.

A closed loop is formed by the sealing material <b>32</b>, and then the filling material <b>33</b> is dropped therein from the head <b>43</b> once or a plurality of times. The filling material having high viscosity is continuously discharged and attached to a forming region without being cut off. On the other hand, the filling material having low viscosity is intermittently discharged and dropped as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. At that time, in order to prevent reaction of the sealing material <b>32</b> and the filling material <b>33</b>, the barrier layer <b>34</b> may be provided. Subsequently, the substrates are attached in vacuum and cured by ultraviolet ray; thereby filled with the filling material. By using a substance having a moisture absorbing property such as a drying agent as the filling material, a further moisture absorbing effect is obtained and deterioration of elements can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">In order to prevent deterioration of elements due to moisture, a drying agent is provided in the EL display panel. In this embodiment mode, the drying agent is provided in a depression portion formed in the sealing substrate so as to surround the pixel region, therefore, it does not disturb thin design. Further, as a large moisture absorbing area is provided by forming a drying agent in a region corresponding to the gate wiring layer, a high moisture absorbing effect can be obtained. In addition, when a drying agent is formed over the gate wiring layer which does not directly emit light, reduction in light extracting efficiency can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">It is to be noted in this embodiment mode that the light emitting element is sealed by a glass substrate; however, as the light emitting element is sealed in order to protect it from moisture, a method to mechanically seal with a cover material, a method to seal with heat curable resin or ultraviolet curable resin, a method to seal with a thin film having a high barrier property such as metal oxide, nitride, or the like can also be used. As the cover material, glass, ceramics, plastic, or metal can be used, which is required to have light transmissivity when light is emitted to the cover material side. The cover material and the substrate over which the aforementioned light emitting element is formed are attached to each other by using a sealing material such as heat curable resin or ultraviolet curable resin. Then, the resin is cured by thermal treatment or ultraviolet ray irradiation treatment to form an enclosed space. It is also effective to provide a moisture absorbing material typified by barium oxide in the enclosed space. The moisture absorbing material may be provided on a sealing material, over or in the periphery of the partition which does not disturb light from the light emitting element. Further, it is possible to fill the space between the cover material and the substrate over which the light emitting element is formed with heat curable resin or ultraviolet curable resin. In this case, it is effective to add a moisture absorbing material typified by barium oxide in the heat curable resin or ultraviolet curable resin.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">An embodiment mode of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 13</figref>. This embodiment mode shows an example where the second interlayer insulating layer (the insulating layers <b>181</b> and <b>182</b>) is not formed in the display device manufactured in Embodiment Mode 5. Therefore, description on the same portion or a portion having a similar function is not repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">As described in Embodiment Mode 5, the thin film transistors <b>173</b>, <b>174</b>, <b>175</b>, and <b>176</b>, and the insulating films <b>167</b> and <b>168</b> are formed over the substrate <b>100</b>. Each thin film transistor has a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer connected to the source region or the drain region of the semiconductor layer. A first electrode layer <b>770</b> is formed in contact with the source electrode layer or drain electrode layer <b>172</b> <i>b </i>in the thin film transistor <b>176</b> provided in the pixel region <b>206</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">The electroluminescent layer <b>188</b> is formed over the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer <b>189</b> is stacked thereover; thereby the light emitting element <b>190</b> is formed. The FPC <b>194</b> is adhered to the terminal electrode layer <b>178</b> through the anisotropic conductive layer <b>196</b> in the external terminal connecting region <b>202</b>.

In the display device of this embodiment mode, the sealing material <b>192</b> and the insulating layer <b>186</b> are formed apart from each other so as not to have a contact. When the sealing material and the insulating layer <b>186</b> are formed apart from each other in this manner, moisture does not easily enter even when using an insulating material using an organic material having a high moisture absorbing property for the insulating layer <b>186</b>.

When the first electrode layer <b>780</b> is formed prior to the source electrode layer or drain electrode layer <b>781</b>, the source electrode layer or drain electrode layer <b>781</b> can be formed over a plane forming region. Therefore, there is an advantage in that favorable coverage can be obtained and polishing treatment such as CMP can be sufficiently performed, and thus the source electrode layer or drain electrode layer <b>781</b> can be formed with good planarity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">A structure of the light emitting element <b>190</b> applicable to this embodiment mode is described in details with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0261">Each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18D</figref> shows a structure of a light emitting element. A light emitting element includes an electroluminescent layer <b>860</b> formed of a mixture of an organic compound and an inorganic compound sandwiched between a first electrode layer <b>870</b> and a second electrode layer <b>850</b>. The electroluminescent layer <b>860</b> is formed of a first layer <b>804</b>, a second layer <b>803</b>, and a third layer <b>802</b> as shown. In particular, the first layer <b>804</b> and the third layer <b>802</b> have notable characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0262">The first layer <b>804</b> functions to transport holes into the second layer <b>803</b> and includes at least a first organic compound and a first inorganic compound having an electron acceptor property for the first organic compound. What is important is not simply that the first organic compound and the first inorganic compound are mixed, but that the first inorganic compound has a higher electron acceptor property for the first organic compound. With such a structure, a lot of hole carriers are generated in the first organic compound which originally has hardly any internal carriers, thereby an excellent hole injecting property and hole transporting property can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">Therefore, the first layer <b>804</b> can have superior conductivity (a hole injecting and transporting property particularly in the first layer <b>804</b>) as well as an effect which is thought to be obtained by mixing an inorganic compound (such as improvement in heat resistance). This effect cannot be obtained in a conventional hole transporting layer in which an organic compound and an inorganic compound which do not mutually affect each other electronically are simply mixed. Because of this effect, a driving voltage can be set lower than before. Further, as the first layer <b>804</b> can be fowled thick without increasing the driving voltage, a short-circuit of the element caused by dust or the like can also be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0264">As described above, hole carriers are generated in the first organic compound, therefore, it is preferable that the first organic compound have a hole transporting property. As the organic compound having a hole transporting property, for example, phthalocyanine (abbreviation: H<sub>2</sub>Pc), copper phthalocyanine (abbreviation: CuPc), vanadyl phthalocyanine (abbreviation: VOPc), 4,4′,4″-tris(N,N-diphenylamino)-triphenylamine (abbreviation: TDATA), 4,4′,4″-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]-triphenylamine (abbreviation: MTDATA), 1,3,5-tris[N,N-di(m-tolyl)amino]benzene (abbreviation: m-MTDAB), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (abbreviation: TPD), 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: NPB), 4,4′-bis{N-[4-di(m-tolyl)amino]phenyl-N-phenylamino}biphenyl (abbreviation: DNTPD), and 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TCTA). However, the organic compound having a hole transporting property is not limited to these. In addition, of the compounds mentioned above, aromatic amine compounds as typified by TDATA, MTDATA, m-MTDAB, TPD, NPB, DNTPD, and TCTA easily generate hole carriers, and are a suitable group of compounds for the first organic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0265">On the other hand, the first inorganic compound may be any material as long as the material easily accepts electrons from the first organic compound, and various metal oxides and metal nitrides can be used. However, transition metal oxides each having a transition metal that belongs to any one of Groups 4 to 12 of the periodic table are preferred since an electron accepting property is easily provided. Specifically, the transition metal oxides include titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, rhenium oxide, ruthenium oxide, and zinc oxide. In addition, of the metal oxides mentioned above, many of transition metal oxides each having a transition metal that belongs to any one of Groups 4 to 8 have a higher electron accepting property, which are a preferable group of compounds. In particular, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, and rhenium oxide are preferred since these oxides can be used easily for vacuum deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0266">It is to be noted that the first layer <b>804</b> may be formed by stacking a plurality of layers each including a combination of an organic compound and an inorganic compound as described above, or may further include another organic or inorganic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0267">Next, the third layer <b>802</b> will be described. The third layer <b>802</b> is a layer that takes on the function of transporting electrons to the second layer <b>803</b>, includes at least a third organic compound and a third inorganic compound that exhibits an electron donating property to the third organic compound. What is important is that the third inorganic compound is not only mixed with the third organic compound but also exhibits an electron donating property to the third organic compound. This structure generates a lot of electron carriers in the third organic compound, which originally has hardly any internal carriers, to provide an excellent electron injecting and transporting property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0268">Therefore, the third layer <b>802</b> provides not only advantages that are considered to be obtained by mixing an inorganic compound (for example, improvement in heat resistance) but also excellent conductivity (in particular, electron injecting and transporting properties in the case of the third layer <b>802</b>). This excellent conductivity is an advantage that is not able to be obtained from a conventional electron transporting layer in which an organic compound and an inorganic compound that do not electronically interact with each other are simply mixed. This advantage makes it possible to lower a driving voltage more than ever before. In addition, since the third layer <b>802</b> can be made thicker without causing an increase in driving voltage, a short circuit of an element due to dust and the like can also be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0269">Meanwhile, it is preferable to use an electron-transporting organic compound as the third organic compound since electron carriers are generated in the third organic compound as described above. Examples of the electron-transporting organic compound include, but are not limited to, tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviation: Alq<sub>3</sub>), tris(4-methyl-8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviation: Almq<sub>3</sub>), bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinolinato)beryllium (abbreviation: BeBq<sub>2</sub>), bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)(4-phenylphenolato)aluminum (abbreviation: BAlq), bis[2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)-benzoxazolato]zinc (abbreviation: Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>) or bis[2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazolato]zinc (abbreviation: Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>), bathophenanthroline (abbreviation: BPhen), bathocuproin (abbreviation: BCP), 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (abbreviation: PBD), 1,3-bis[5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl]benzene (abbreviation: OXD-7), 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (abbreviation: TPBI), 3-(4-biphenylyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviation: TAZ), and 3-(4-biphenylyl)-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviation: p-EtTAZ). In addition, of the compounds mentioned above, chelate metal complexes each having a chelate ligand including an aromatic ring as typified by Alq<sub>3</sub>, Almq<sub>3</sub>, BeBq<sub>2</sub>, BAlq, Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>, and Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>, organic compounds each having a phenanthroline skeleton as typified by BPhen and BCP, and organic compounds each having an oxadiazole skeleton as typified by PBD and OXD-7 easily generate electron carriers, and are suitable groups of compounds for the third organic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0270">On the other hand, the third inorganic compound may be any material as long as the material easily donates electrons from the third organic compound, and various metal oxides and metal nitrides can be used. However, alkali metal oxides, alkaline-earth metal oxides, rare-earth metal oxides, alkali metal nitrides, alkaline-earth metal nitrides, and rare-earth metal nitrides are preferred since an electron donating property is easily provided. Specifically, examples of the oxides mentioned above include lithium oxide, strontium oxide, barium oxide, erbium oxide, lithium nitride, magnesium nitride, calcium nitride, yttrium nitride, and lanthanum nitride. In particular, lithium oxide, barium oxide, lithium nitride, magnesium nitride, and calcium nitride are preferred since these oxides and nitrides can be used easily for vacuum deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0271">It is to be noted that the third layer <b>802</b> may be formed by stacking a plurality of layers each including a combination of an organic compound and an inorganic compound as described above, or may further include another organic compound or inorganic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0272">Next, the second layer <b>803</b> will be described. The second layer <b>803</b> is a layer that takes on the function of emitting light, and includes at least a second organic compound that is luminescent and may include a second inorganic compound. The second layer <b>803</b> can be formed by mixing some of various luminescent organic compounds and inorganic compounds. However, since it is considered that a current does not easily flow through the second layer <b>803</b> as compared with the first layer <b>804</b> or the third layer <b>802</b>, it is preferable that the thickness of the second layer <b>803</b> be approximately 10 to 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0273">The second organic compound is not particularly limited as long as a luminescent organic compound is used, and examples of the second organic compound include 9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (abbreviation: DNA), 9,10-di(2-naphthyl)-2-tert-butylanthracene (abbreviation: t-BuDNA), 4,4′-bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)biphenyl (abbreviation: DPVBi), coumarin 30, coumarin 6, coumarin 545, coumarin 545T, perylene, rubrene, periflanthene, 2,5,8,11-tetra(tert-butyl)perylene (abbreviation: TBP), 9,10-diphenylanthracene (abbreviation: DPA), 5,12-diphenyltetracene, 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM1), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-[2-(julolidine-9-yl)ethenyl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM2), and 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2,6-bis[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: BisDCM). In addition, it is also possible to use compounds that are capable of producing phosphorescence such as bis[2-(4′,6′-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C<sup>2</sup>′]iridium(picolinate) (abbreviation: FIrpic), bis{2-[3′,5′-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridinato-N,C<sup>2</sup>′}iridium(picolinate) (abbreviation: Ir(CF<sub>3 </sub>ppy)<sub>2</sub>(pic)), tris(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C<sup>2</sup>′)iridium (abbreviation: Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>), bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C<sup>2</sup>′)iridium(acetylacetonate) (abbreviation: Ir(ppy)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), bis[2-(2′-thienyl)pyridinato-N,C<sup>3</sup>′]iridium(acetylacetonate) (abbreviation: Ir(thp)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), bis(2-phenylquinolinato-N,C<sup>2</sup>′)iridium(acetylacetonate) (abbreviation: Ir(pq)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), and bis[2-(2′-benzothienyl)pyridinato-N,C<sup>3</sup>′]iridium(acetylacetonate) (abbreviation: Ir(btp)<sub>2</sub>(acac)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0274">Moreover, the second layer <b>803</b> may be formed of not only a singlet-excited light-emitting material but also a triplet-excited light-emitting material including a metal complex or the like. For example, among pixels for emitting red, green, and blue light, the pixel for emitting the red color, which has a relatively short half brightness life period of luminance, is formed of the triplet-excited light-emitting material and the other two pixels are formed of the singlet-excited light-emitting material. The triplet-excited light-emitting material has an advantage of low power consumption to obtain the same luminance as that of the singlet-excited light-emitting material because the triplet-excited light-emitting material has higher light-emission efficiency. In other words, when the pixel for the red color is formed of the triplet-excited light-emitting material, the reliability can be improved because the light-emitting element requires a smaller amount of current. For lower power consumption, the pixels for the red and green colors may be formed of the triplet-excited light-emitting material and the pixel for the blue color may be formed of the singlet-excited light-emitting material. When the light-emitting element of the green color that is highly visible to human eyes is formed of the triplet-excited light-emitting material, the power consumption can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0275">Further, not only the second layer <b>803</b> may include the second organic compound described above, which produces luminescence, but also another organic compound may be added thereto. Examples of organic compounds that can be added include, but are not limited to, TDATA, MTDATA, m-MTDAB, TPD, NPB, DNTPD, TCTA, Alq<sub>3</sub>, Almq<sub>3</sub>, BeBq<sub>2</sub>, BAlq, Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>, Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>, BPhen, BCP, PBD, OXD-7, TPBI, TAZ, p-EtTAZ, DNA, t-BuDNA, and DPVBi, which are mentioned above, and further, 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (abbreviation: CBP) and 1,3,5-tris[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]benzene (abbreviation: TCPB). It is to be noted that it is preferable that the organic compound, which is added in addition to the second organic compound as described above, have larger excitation energy than the second organic compound and be added more than the second organic compound in order to make the second organic compound produce luminescence efficiently (which makes it possible to prevent concentration quenching of the second organic compound). In addition, as another function, the added organic compound may produce luminescence along with the second organic compound (which makes it possible to produce white luminescence).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0276">The second layer <b>803</b> may have a structure for performing color display by providing each pixel with a light emitting layer having different emission wavelength bands. Typically, a light emitting layer corresponding to each color of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) is formed. In this case, color purity can be increased and a pixel portion can be prevented from having a mirror surface (glare) by providing a light emitting side of a pixel with a filter which transmits light of an emission wavelength band. Providing a filter can omit a circularly polarizing plate or the like which is conventionally used to prevent a pixel portion from having a mirror surface (glare) and can eliminate the loss of light emitted from the light emitting layer. Further, a change in tone, which occurs when a pixel portion (display screen) is obliquely seen, can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0277">A high molecular organic light emitting material or a low molecular organic light emitting material can be used for the material of the second layer <b>803</b>. A high molecular organic light emitting material is physically stronger than a low molecular material and is superior in durability of the element. In addition, a high molecular organic light emitting material can be formed by coating; therefore, the element can be manufactured relatively easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0278">The emission color is determined depending on a material forming the light emitting layer; therefore, a light emitting element which displays desired luminescence can be formed by selecting an appropriate material for the light emitting layer. As a high molecular electroluminescent material which can be used for forming a light emitting layer, a polyparaphenylene-vinylene-based material, a polyparaphenylene-based material, a polythiophene-based material, or a polyfluorene-based material can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0279">As the polyparaphenylene vinylene-based material, a derivative of poly(paraphenylenevinylene) [PPV], for example, poly(2,5-dialkoxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene) [RO-PPV]; poly(2-(2′-ethyl-hexoxy)-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene) [MEH-PPV]; poly(2-(dialkoxyphenyl)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) [ROPh-PPV]; and the like can be used. As the polyparaphenylene-based material, a derivative of polyparaphenylene [PPP], for example, poly(2,5-dialkoxy-1,4-phenylene) [RO-PPP]; poly(2,5-dihexoxy-1,4-phenylene); and the like can be used. As the polythiophene-based material, a derivative of polythiophene [PT], for example, poly(3-alkylthiophene) [PAT]; poly(3-hexylthiophen) [PHT]; poly(3-cyclohexylthiophen) [PCHT]; poly(3-cyclohexyl-4-methylthiophene) [PCHMT]; poly(3,4-dicyclohexylthiophene) [PDCHT]; poly[3-(4-octylphenyl)-thiophene] [POPT]; poly[3-(4-octylphenyl)-2,2-bithiophene] [PTOPT]; and the like can be used. As the polyfluorene-based material, a derivative of polyfluorene [PF], for example, poly(9,9-dialkylfluorene) [PDAF]; poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) [PDOF]; and the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0280">The second inorganic compound may be any inorganic material as long as luminescence of the second organic compound is not easily subject to quenching by the inorganic compound, and various metal oxides and metal nitrides can be used. In particular, metal oxides each having a metal that belongs to Group 13 or 14 of the periodic table are preferred since luminescence of the second organic compound is not easily subject to quenching, and specifically, aluminum oxide, gallium oxide, silicon oxide, and germanium oxide are preferred. However, the second inorganic compound is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0281">It is to be noted that the second layer <b>803</b> may be formed by stacking a plurality of layers each including a combination of the organic compound and the inorganic compound as described above, or may further include another organic or inorganic compound. The structure of the light emitting layer may vary. Such changes as dispersing a light emitting material and providing a dedicated electrode layer instead of providing a specific electron injecting region or light emitting region are construed as being included in the invention unless such changes depart from the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0282">A light emitting element formed with the above described materials emits light by being forward biased. A pixel of a display device formed with a light emitting element can be driven by a simple matrix mode or an active matrix mode. In any event, each pixel emits light by applying a forward bias thereto at a specific timing; however, the pixel is in a non-light-emitting state for a certain period. Reliability of a light emitting element can be improved by applying a reverse bias in the non-light-emitting time. In a light emitting element, there is a deterioration mode in which emission intensity is decreased under specific driving conditions or a deterioration mode in which a non-light-emitting region is enlarged in the pixel and luminance is apparently decreased. However, progression of deterioration can be slowed down by alternating current driving where bias is applied forward and reversely. Thus, reliability of a light emitting device can be improved. Additionally, either of digital driving and analog driving can be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0283">In the case of a top emission type and dual emission type display device, a color filter (colored layer) may be formed over the sealing substrate. The color filter (colored layer) can be formed by a deposition method or a droplet discharge method. With the use of the color filter (colored layer), high-definition display can also be performed. This is because a broad peak can be modified by the color filter (colored layer) to be sharp in light emission spectrum of each RGB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0284">Full color display can be performed by forming a material which exhibits light emission of a single color and combining a color filter and a color conversion layer. The color filter (colored layer) or the color conversion layer may be formed over, for example, a second substrate (a sealing substrate) and may be attached to a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0285">Naturally, display may be performed in monochrome. For example, an area color type display device may be manufactured by using single color emission. The area color type is suitable for a passive matrix type display area, and can mainly display text and symbols.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0292">As described above, in the light-emitting element according to the present invention, the layer interposed between the first electrode layer <b>870</b> and the second electrode layer <b>850</b> is formed of the electroluminescent layer <b>860</b> including a layer in which an organic compound and an inorganic compound are combined. The light-emitting element is an organic-inorganic composite light-emitting element provided with layers (that is, the first layer <b>804</b> and the third layer <b>802</b>) that provide functions called a high carrier-injecting property and carrier-transporting property by mixing an organic compound and an inorganic compound, where the functions are not obtainable from only either one of the organic compound and the inorganic compound.

These protective diodes are formed in a similar step to the TFT <b>501</b> or <b>502</b> so that a gate and one of a drain and a source are connected to operate as diodes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows an equivalent circuit diagram of a top plan view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0314">The protective diode <b>561</b> is constituted by a gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer, and a wiring layer. The protective diode <b>562</b> has a similar structure. Common potential lines <b>554</b> and <b>555</b> connected to these protective diodes are formed in the same layer as the gate electrode layer. Therefore, a contact hole is required to be formed in the insulating layer so that the common potential lines are electrically connected to the wiring layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0315">A contact hole may be formed in an insulating layer by forming a mask layer and applying etching process. In this case, when etching process by atmospheric pressure discharge is employed, a discharging process can be performed locally, therefore, a mask layer is not required to be formed over the entire surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0316">The signal wiring layer is formed of the same layer as a source or drain wiring layer <b>505</b> and has a structure in which the signal wiring layer connected to the source or drain wiring layer <b>505</b> is connected to a source side or a drain side of the TFT <b>501</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0317">The input terminal portion of the scan line also has a similar structure. A protective diode <b>563</b> includes a gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer, and a wiring layer. A protective diode <b>564</b> has a similar structure. Common potential lines <b>556</b> and <b>557</b> connected to this protective diode are formed in the same layer as the source and drain electrode layers. The protective diodes provided in an input stage can be formed at the same time. Note that the positions to provide the protective diodes are not limited to this embodiment mode and can be also provided between a driver circuit and a pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0318">As shown in the top plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the wiring layer has a pattern where a corner that is a right triangle in each edge bent into an L shape is removed so that one side of the triangle is 10 μm or shorter, or equal to or longer than one-fifth the line width of the wiring layer and equal to or shorter than half the line width of the wiring layer, thereby the edge is rounded. That is to say, the circumference of the wiring layer in the edge is curved when seen from above. Corners are rounded by removing sharp corners with equal to or longer than one-fifth the width of the wiring layer and equal to or shorter than half the width of the wiring layer. Specifically, in order to form a round circumference of the edge, a part of the wiring layer is removed, which corresponds to an isosceles right triangle having two first straight lines that are perpendicular to each other making the edge, and a second straight line that makes an angle of about 45 degrees with the two first straight lines. When removing the triangle, two obtuse angles are formed in the wiring layer. At this time, the wiring layer is preferably etched by appropriately adjusting the etching conditions and/or a mask design so that a curved line in contact with the first straight line and the second straight line is formed in each obtuse angle part. Note that the length of the two sides of the isosceles right triangle, which are equal to each other, is equal to or longer than one-fifth of the width of the wiring layer and equal to or shorter than half the width of the wiring layer. In addition, the inner circumference of the edge is also made curved in accordance with the circumference of edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0319">When the wiring layer is thus disposed so that the corner and the portion where the wire width changes are curved, generation of fine particles due to abnormal discharge can be suppressed in dry etching using plasma. In addition, even when fine particles which tend to gather at a depressed portion are generated, the fine particles can be washed, and yield can be expected to increase significantly. That is to say, the problems of dust and fine particles in manufacturing steps can be solved. Further, the round corner of the wire allows electrical conduction. In addition, dust in multiple parallel wires can be washed effectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0361">An example of capable of being applied to product management and distribution system is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>. This embodiment mode shows an example of incorporating a processor chip in a product. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, a processor chip <b>3402</b> is mounted on a beer bottle <b>3400</b> using a label <b>3401</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0362">The processor chip <b>3402</b> stores basic data such as a manufacturing date, a manufacturing area, and ingredients. Such basic data is not required to be rewritten, thus it may be stored in a non-rewritable memory such as a mask ROM and a memory element of the invention. The basic data such as a manufacturing date, a manufacturing area, and ingredients is information that consumers may want to correctly obtain when purchasing a product. When such information is stored in a non-rewritable memory element, falsification of data and the like can be prevented, and thus accurate information with high reliability can be transmitted to the consumers. The processor chip <b>3402</b> also stores individual data such as a delivery address and a delivery date of each beer bottle. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, when the beer bottle <b>3400</b> moving on a conveyor belt <b>3412</b> passes a writer device <b>3413</b>, each delivery address and delivery date can be stored in the processor chip <b>3402</b>. Such individual data may be stored in a rewritable and erasable memory such as an EEPROM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0363">A system is preferably configured such that when data on a purchased product is transmitted from a delivery destination to a distribution management center via a network, the delivery address and date are calculated based on the product data by a writer device, a personal computer for controlling the writer device, or the like, and then stored in the processor chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0364">Since the bottles are delivered per case, a processor chip may be incorporated in each case or every several cases to store individual data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0365">When the processor chip is incorporated in such products that may store a plurality of delivery addresses, the time required for manual data input can be reduced, resulting in reduced input errors. In addition, it is possible to lower labor costs that are the most costly expenses in the distribution management. Thus, incorporation of the processor chip allows the distribution management to be performed with few errors at low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0366">Additional data such as food to go with beer and a recipe with beer may be stored at the delivery destination. As a result, the food and the like can be promoted and consumers' willingness to buy can be increased. Such additional data may be stored in a rewritable and erasable memory such as an EEPROM. In this manner, incorporation of the processor chip increases the amount of information given to consumers; thus they can purchase products at ease.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0367">In this embodiment mode, other structures which can be applied to a light emitting element of the invention are described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A to 35C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0368">A light emitting element which utilizes electroluminescence is categorized depending on a light emitting material: an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is called an organic EL element while the latter is called an inorganic EL element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0369">The inorganic EL element is categorized into a dispersion type inorganic EL element and a thin film inorganic EL element depending on the element structure. The former has an electroluminescent layer in which particles of light emitting material are dispersed in a binder while the latter has an electroluminescent layer formed of a thin film of a light emitting material. However, they are common in that an electron accelerated in a high electronic field is required. As a light emission mechanism, there are a donor-acceptor recombination type light emission which utilizes a donor level and an acceptor level and a localized type light emission which utilizes inner-shell electron transition of metal ions. In general, a dispersion type inorganic EL element employs a donor-acceptor recombination type light emission while a thin film type inorganic EL element employs localized light emission in many cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0370">A light emitting material which can be used in the invention is formed of a host material and an impurity element as a light emission center. By changing the impurity element to be contained, light emission of various colors can be obtained. As a manufacturing method of a light emitting material, various methods such as a solid phase method and a liquid phase method (coprecipitation method) can be used. In addition, a liquid phase method such as a spray pyrolysis method, a metathesis method, a method by pyrolysis decomposition reaction of precursor, a reverse micelle method, a combination method of the aforementioned method and high temperature baking, a freeze drying method, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0371">In the solid phase method, a host material and an impurity element or a compound containing an impurity element are weighed, mixed in a mortar, and heated and baked in an electric furnace so as to react, thereby the impurity element is contained in the host material. The baking temperature is preferably 700 to 1500° C. When the temperature is too low, the solid phase reaction does not proceed while when the temperature is too high, the host material is decomposed. It is to be noted that baking may be carried out in a powder state; however, a pellet state is preferable. A relatively high temperature is required for baking; however, this method being simple and favorable in productivity is suitable for mass production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0372">The liquid phase method (coprecipitation method) is a method to react a host material or a compound containing a host material and an impurity element or a compound containing an impurity element in a solution, dried, and then baked. The particles of the light emitting material are evenly distributed; therefore, the reaction proceeds even with small particles at a low baking temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0373">As a host material used for the light emitting material, sulfide, oxide, and nitride can be used. As sulfide, for example, zinc sulfide (ZnS), cadmium sulfide (CdS), calcium sulfide (CaS), yttrium sulfide (Y<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), gallium sulfide (Ga<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), strontium sulfide (SrS), barium sulfide (BaS) or the like can be used. As oxide, for example, zinc oxide (ZnO), yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or the like can be used. As nitride, for example, aluminum nitride (AlN), gallium nitride (GaN), indium nitride (InN), or the like can be used. Furthermore, zinc selenide (ZnSe), zinc telluride (ZnTe) or the like can also be used and a mixed crystal of ternary compound system such as calcium gallium-sulfide (CaGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>), strontium gallium sulfide (SrGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>), or barium-gallium sulfide (BaGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) may be used as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0374">As the light emission center of the localized type light emission, manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), samarium (Sm), terbium (Tb), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), europium (Eu), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), or the like can be used. In addition, as charge compensation, halogen element such as fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) may be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0375">On the other hand, as a light emission center of the donor-acceptor recombination type light emission, a light emitting material containing a first impurity element which forms a donor level and a second impurity element which forms an acceptor level can be used. As the first impurity element, for example, fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aluminum (Al), or the like can be used. As the second impurity element, for example, copper (Cu), silver (Ag), or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0376">In the case of synthesizing the light emitting material of the donor-acceptor recombination type light emission by the solid phase method, a host material, a first impurity element or a compound containing the first impurity element, and a second impurity element or a compound containing the second impurity element are each weighed and mixed in a mortar, and then heated and baked in an electronic furnace. As the host material, the aforementioned host material can be used. As the first impurity element or the compound containing the first impurity element, for example, fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aluminum sulfide (Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), and the like can be used. As the second impurity element or a compound containing the second impurity element, for example, copper (Cu), silver (Ag), copper sulfide (Cu<sub>2</sub>S), silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S), and the like can be used. The baking temperature is preferably 700 to 1500° C. When the temperature is too low, the solid phase reaction does not proceed while when the temperature is too high, the host material is decomposed. It is to be noted that baking may be carried out in a powder state; however, a pellet state is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0377">As an impurity element used in the case of utilizing the solid phase reaction, a compound formed of the first impurity element and the second impurity element may be used in combination. In this case, the impurity element is easily dispersed which facilitates the solid phase reaction. Therefore, an even light emitting material can be obtained. Furthermore, as no redundant impurity elements are included, a highly pure light emitting material can be obtained. As a compound formed of the first impurity element and the second impurity element, for example, copper chloride (CuCl), silver chloride (AgCl), or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0378">It is to be noted that the concentration of these impurity elements may be 0.01 to 10 atom %, or preferably 0.05 to 5 atom % with respect to the host material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0379">In the case of a thin film type inorganic EL element, the electroluminescent layer contains the aforementioned light emitting material and can be formed by a resistance heating vapor deposition method, a vacuum vapor deposition method such as electron beam evaporation (EB deposition) method, a physical vapor deposition method (PVD) such as a sputtering method, an organic metal CVD method, a chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) such as hydride transfer low pressure CVD method, an atomic layer epitaxy method (ALE), or the like.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0383">In the case of a dispersion type inorganic EL element, an electroluminescent layer in a film state is formed by dispersing a light emitting material in particles in binder. In the case where particles in a desired shape cannot be obtained sufficiently depending on a manufacturing method of a light emitting material, the particles may be processed by crushing in a mortar or the like. The binder is a substance for fixing the light emitting material in particles in a dispersed state and holding them in a shape as an electroluminescent layer. The light emitting material is evenly dispersed in the electroluminescent layer and fixed by the binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0384">In the case of a dispersion type inorganic EL element, the electroluminescent layer may be formed by a droplet discharge method by which an electroluminescent layer can be selectively formed, a printing method (such as screen printing or offset printing), a coating method such as a spin coating method, a dipping method, a dispenser method, or the like. The thickness it not particularly limited; however, it is preferably 10 to 1000 nm. Further, it is preferable that the ratio of the light emitting material is 50 to 80 wt % in the electroluminescent layer containing a light emitting material and binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0385"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A to 35C</figref> show examples of a dispersion type inorganic EL element which can be used as a light emitting element.

The electroluminescent layer <b>62</b> contains a light emitting material <b>61</b> held by the binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0386">An insulating material can be used as binder in this embodiment mode. A mixed material of an organic material and an inorganic material may also be used. As the organic insulating material, a polymer material having a relatively high dielectric constant such as cyanoethyl cellulose-based resin, resin such as polyethylen, polypropylene, polystyrenic resin, silicone resin, epoxy resin, and vinylidene fluoride can be used. Moreover, heat resistant high molecular such as aromatic polyamide, polybenzimidazole, or siloxane resin may be used. A siloxane resin includes a Si—O—Si bond. Siloxane has a skeleton formed by the bond of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O), in which an organic group containing at least hydrogen (such as an alkyl group and aromatic hydrocarbon) is included as a substituent. Alternatively, a fluoro group may be used as the substituent. Further alternatively, a fluoro group and an organic group containing at least hydrogen may be used as the substituent. Further, vinyl resin such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl butyral, a resin material such as phenol resin, novolac resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin, urethane resin, and oxazole resin (polybenzoxazole) may be used. A dielectric constant can be controlled by mixing micro particles having a high dielectric constant such as barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) and strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) in the aforementioned resin.</div>

When an organic material contains an inorganic material having a high dielectric constant (by adding or the like), a dielectric constant of the electroluminescent layer formed of a light emitting material and binder can be more controlled, thereby the dielectric constant can be larger. By using a mixed layer of an inorganic material and an organic material for the binder so as to obtain a high dielectric constant, a large charge can be induced in the light emitting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0388">A light emitting material is dispersed in a solution containing binder in the manufacturing steps. As a solvent of a solution containing binder which can be used in this embodiment mode, a solvent which enables the binder material to be dissolved and to manufacture a solution with a suitable viscosity for a desired whickness and a method for forming an electroluminescent layer (various wet processes) may be appropriately selected.
