<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/370,746, filed on Feb. 13, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to semiconductor fabrication processes and equipment.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The semiconductor chip fabrication industry continues to strive for reductions in costs. One of the major strategies to reduce the production cost per chip is to migrate towards the use of larger diameter semiconductor wafers. Current semiconductor foundries primarily use 200 mm (8 inch) and 300 mm (12 inch) silicon wafers. By migrating to use of 450 mm wafers, the number of dies (of the same size) produced from each wafer will increase approximately in proportion to the growth in the area of the wafer. Thus, a 450 mm wafer can yield 2.25 times as many chips as a 300 mm wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Processing larger wafers introduces mechanical challenges. One of the methods of providing a reliable process with a high yield is strict control over processing conditions. Because a 450 mm wafer has a larger diameter and surface area, it is more difficult to attain and maintain a uniform environment throughout the wafer while processing. For example, several processing steps are performed at specific temperatures. If heat or cooling is applied at discrete locations on the wafer, hot spots or cold spots may occur on the wafer. Additionally, secondary sources of heating and cooling (e.g., radiative heat transfer to or from the chamber walls) may affect the wafer unevenly. If the wafer temperature is not uniform throughout the wafer, then local variations may occur in various processing steps, causing within die variations and within wafer (between die) variations, such as line width variations.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">This description of the exemplary embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description. In the description, relative terms such as “lower,” “upper,” “horizontal,” “vertical,”, “above,” “below,” “up,” “down,” “top” and “bottom” as well as derivative thereof (e.g., “horizontally,” “downwardly,” “upwardly,” etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing under discussion. These relative terms are for convenience of description and do not require that the apparatus be constructed or operated in a particular orientation. Terms concerning attachments, coupling and the like, such as “connected” and “interconnected,” refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships, unless expressly described otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an implantation tool <b>100</b>. The tool <b>100</b> has a wafer transfer chamber <b>102</b>, which maintains the wafers in a sealed vacuum environment. A plurality of loadlocks <b>104</b> are connectible to the wafer transfer chamber <b>102</b>. The loadlocks <b>104</b> can vent to atmospheric pressure. The loadlocks <b>104</b> are configured to receive wafers <b>105</b> from the four-loadport atmosphere-transfer module <b>114</b>, or other robotic device. The loadlocks <b>104</b> are then sealed shut and evacuated to vacuum pressure. The wafers <b>105</b> can then be transferred to the wafer transfer chamber <b>102</b> without interrupting the vacuum or process flow in wafer transfer chamber <b>102</b>. The wafers <b>105</b> are transferred from the wafer transfer chamber <b>102</b> to the process cooling platen or electrostatic chuck (e-chuck) <b>106</b> of the process chamber <b>112</b>. The process cooling platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> is cooled by a plurality of refrigerants supplied in cooling lines by a first refrigerator (compressor) <b>103</b>, a second refrigerator <b>113</b>, and a third refrigerator <b>123</b> for cooling to lower temperatures. The process chamber <b>112</b> has a scan motor <b>108</b> that produces an ion beam <b>110</b> for the implantation process step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Implantation is performed by bombarding the wafer <b>105</b> with an ion beam. Junction leakage can be generated by substrate damage from ion implantation. A low temperature ion implantation process will reduce the substrate damage to eliminate end-of-range (EOR) defects (at the interface between amorphous layer and crystalline layer). Low temperature implantation bombardment of ions creates a totally amorphous region in the target crystal, i.e. one in which no specific crystal structure is present. Performing annealing following the low temperature implantation encourages the implanted region ÿ i.e. the layer represented by the depth to which the bombarding ions have penetrated ÿ to recrystallize into a layer which resembles an epitaxial growth portion, giving this technique the name “solid-phase-epitaxy.” The low implantation temperature should be uniform throughout the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The inventor has determined that when a conventional cooling platen is used for low temperature ion implantation, the temperature of the wafer varies, and is approximately a function of the radial position on the wafer. For example, if a cooling gas is supplied at the center of the wafer, the center will have the lowest temperature, and the periphery of the wafer will have the highest temperature. In such a configuration, as the radius of the wafer is increased to 450 mm, the potential temperature difference between center and periphery may be larger. This can result in non-uniform crystalline structure throughout the wafer, leading to non-uniform device performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a more detailed diagram of an exemplary multi-zone cooling platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> of the process chamber <b>112</b>. The platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> is suitable for within-wafer temperature control during the implantation process. By providing a uniform desired temperature throughout the wafer during implantation, improvements in critical dimension (CD) uniformity, are possible, which makes it possible to improve within-wafer junction leakage performance, and threshold voltage uniformity, and to reduce or eliminate Ni piping defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> within the process chamber <b>112</b> is configured to support a semiconductor wafer. The platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> has a plurality of temperature zones <b>101</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, where regions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> form a single temperature control zone. Each temperature zone <b>101</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> includes at least one fluid conduit within or adjacent to the electrostatic chuck, as shown in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> has at least two coolant sources <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>123</b>. Each coolant source <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> is fluidly coupled to a respective one of the fluid conduits in respective temperature control zones <b>101</b>, <b>111</b> and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Each coolant source <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> is configured to supply a respectively different coolant to a respective one of the plurality of temperature zones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the at least two coolant sources including respectively different chilling or refrigeration units <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>123</b> configured to supply respectively different coolants at respectively different temperatures. For example, the coolants may be cryogenic fluids, such as coolants from the group consisting of liquid hydrogen (20 K, −253 C.), liquid helium (3 K, −270 C.), liquid nitrogen (77 K, −196 C.), liquid oxygen (90 K, −183 C.), liquid methane (112 K, −162 C), and liquid nitrous oxide (88 K, −185 C). Thus, the cooling platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> can be cooled to a selected one of these temperatures. Alternatively, a refrigerated, non-cryogenic coolant may be used to provide a temperature of about −50 C., 0 C., or 5 C. Depending on the configuration of the cooling platen or e-chuck <b>106</b>, and the thermal conductance of the materials therein, the wafer temperature may be a few degrees higher than the temperature of the coolant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plurality of temperature zones include a plurality of concentric annular zones <b>101</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Annular temperature control zones are generally suitable for a cylindrical wafer in which the local temperature is generally a function of the radial coordinate in a cylindrical polar coordinate system having its center at the center of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows three temperature control zones <b>101</b>, <b>111</b> and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, in alternative embodiments, any number of two or more temperature control zones may be included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In some configurations, the temperature distribution may also vary with the tangential polar coordinate of the wafer (e.g., if the platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> is on positioned a pedestal having an axially asymmetric internal structure that does not distribute heat evenly). In such configurations, each radial temperature zone may be subdivided into two, three or four angular zones, to provide more precise temperature control for greater temperature uniformity during ion implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">A temperature controller <b>130</b> is provided for independently controlling the supply of the respectively different coolants from the refrigerators <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> to the plurality of temperature zones at respectively different temperatures so as to maintain a substantially uniform wafer temperature across the wafer. Temperature feedback is used to control the temperature in each zone. The temperature feedback may be collected by a plurality of sensors on or in the platen or e-chuck <b>106</b>. Alternatively, an image of the temperature distribution may be collected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">If cryogenic coolants are used, each coolant is supplied at substantially constant supply temperatures. The amount of heat removed from each zone can be controlled either by varying the duty cycle of coolant flow (with a constant flow rate), or by varying the volumetric flow rate of the coolant in each temperature zone <b>101</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Controller <b>130</b> may have a table indicating an appropriate coolant flow rate or duty cycle for each of the coolant sources as a function of the average temperature in the zone controlled by each respective coolant source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, (e.g., if non-cryogenic coolants are used), one or more of the refrigerators <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>123</b> may be capable of providing an individual coolant over a range of temperatures, so that the temperature of one or more of the zones <b>101</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be controlled by varying the coolant supply temperature within that (those) zone(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">By supplying different coolants in different radial zones, radial variations in the wafer temperature can be minimize or avoided. For example, the first coolant fluid (e.g., liquid methane at −162 C) may be provided in or adjacent to an inner annular zone <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the platen or e-chuck <b>106</b> and the second coolant fluid (e.g., liquid nitrogen at −196 C) may be provided in an outer annular zone <b>111</b> of the platen or e-chuck <b>106</b>, where the second coolant has a lower boiling temperature than the first coolant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show two examples of configurations for the platen or e-chuck. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the coolant fluid conduits <b>101</b>, <b>111</b> and <b>124</b> are tubes arranged on a back surface of the platen <b>106</b>. This configuration may be achieved by welding or otherwise joining the tubing to the back surface. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a configuration in which the conduits <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> and <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are formed inside the platen or e-chuck <b>206</b>. The configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides improved thermal coupling between the coolant and the platen or e-chuck <b>206</b>, relative to the device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> relate to the ion implantation process step, multiple zone temperature control may be used in other portions of the semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication process. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> relate to use of multiple-zone temperature control in film deposition processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic process diagram of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process. A substrate <b>600</b> has a polysilicon gate electrode <b>601</b> thereon. A liner layer <b>602</b> such as a thin conformal oxide layer is formed on the sidewalls of the polysilicon gate electrode <b>601</b> and on the substrate <b>600</b>. A conformal silicon nitride (SiN) layer <b>603</b> is formed over the liner layer <b>602</b>. An anisotropic (dry) etch process is performed, etching away the SiN layer <b>603</b> above the polysilicon gate <b>601</b>. As a result, spacers <b>603</b> are formed beside the polysilicon gate <b>601</b> on the liner layers <b>602</b> due to the anisotropic nature of the etch. The spacers <b>603</b> may be used during the step of forming lightly doped drain (LDD) regions (not shown) in the substrate <b>600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">To control the size of the LDD regions, a critical dimension (CD) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is controlled. The inventor has determined that the CD can be controlled by controlling the thickness of the SiN layer <b>603</b>, and the CD uniformity (CDU) can be controlled by controlling the uniformity of the thickness of the SiN layer <b>603</b>. Further, the thickness uniformity of the SiN layer <b>603</b> and the CDU can be controlled by independently controlling the local temperature of the wafer in a plurality of independently controllable zones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a single wafer deposition chamber is used to tune the specific thickness distribution using multiple heater zone for film deposition and etch matching. The inventor has determined that a single-wafer chamber provides a wafer temperature distribution that is substantially axially symmetric. An axially symmetric temperature distribution can be more easily compensated by a plurality of annular heating zones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram of a single wafer deposition chamber <b>500</b> for depositing a film by a CVD or PECVD process (or other anisotropic deposition process). A platen <b>506</b> is provided for supporting a semiconductor wafer. The platen <b>506</b> has a plurality of independently controllable temperature zones <b>501</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b> and <b>531</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows four temperature control zones <b>501</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b> and <b>531</b>, any desired number of two or more temperature control zones may be used. The larger the number of temperature control zones, the greater the capability to maintain control of the thickness of films <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, and thus the greater the capability to control the CDU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">At least one heating element <b>540</b> is provided in each of the heating zones <b>501</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b> and <b>531</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows 13 heating elements <b>540</b> arranged in a cross configuration, any number of heating elements may be provided, and the heating elements may be arranged in any desired configuration.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows the control process. The exemplary system provides feedback from the actual CD of devices formed by the process and the temperature control for controlling the thickness of the film layers <b>602</b>, <b>603</b>. After the etchings step is performed in an etching tool (e.g., a dry etching tool), CD measurements are made at a plurality of locations in circuit patterns on the wafer. The measurements may be performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), for example. Preferably, the CD measurements are automatically provided to the controller <b>550</b>, or to a processor that interfaces with the controller <b>550</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A processor (e.g., an automatic process controller <b>550</b>) is provided for receiving the plurality of CD measurements from the respective locations etched from the oxide and SiN films on a first semiconductor substrate. The processor is configured to control the heating elements to increase the local thickness of the second film (on a second wafer), if the CD of the first film (at the same position on the first wafer) is less than a desired dimension, and to decrease the thickness of the second film, if the CD of the first film is greater than the desired dimension. In a film deposition process such as CVD or PECVD, as the temperature of the wafer is increased (while holding other process parameters constant), the thickness of the deposited layer increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The controller <b>550</b> determines a heating correction to be applied to each temperature zone <b>501</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>521</b>, <b>531</b> to achieve thickness uniformity of the film to be applied. For example, the controller <b>550</b> may have a table that specifies an increase in heating power to be supplied to each heating element <b>540</b> in a given temperature control zone in proportion to the difference between the average CD in that zone and the desired CD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows a single controller <b>550</b>, the control function may be performed by a plurality of processors.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>706</b>, a CD of the circuit pattern is measured at a plurality of locations. For example, scanning electron microscopy may be used. The plurality of locations should include at least one (and preferably more than one) location in each temperature control zone. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the CD to be measured is the width of the SiN spacer.

In other embodiments, step <b>708</b> is performed every time another wafer is processed in steps <b>700</b>-<b>706</b>. The determination of how often to make the adjustments may be based on several factors, such as stability of the process, the length of time it takes for the platen zone temperatures to adjust to a change in heater power, or a desire to base adjustments on a larger sample of data.</div>

Each temperature control zone can be adjusted separately, to differentially adjust the thickness to improve CDU. The heating power supplied to a temperature zone is increased to increase the thickness of the film, if the CD of the first wafer is less than a desired dimension.

The system includes a coater <b>902</b> (such as a Tractrix™ Spin Tool sold by Site Services, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif.) for applying a photoresist to a substrate. A scanner <b>904</b> exposes the photoresist through a mask to form a desired pattern. A developer <b>906</b> applies a solution to harden desired portions of the photoresist after exposure. A scanning electron microscope <b>908</b> measures the CD of a pattern at a plurality of locations on the wafer and determines the CDU. The SEM <b>908</b> may be integrated into the developer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">For an incoming wafer, initial values may be provided by SEM measurements prior to applying the photoresist to the substrate. For example, the substrate may already have patterns formed by a previous processing step. The CD of these patterns may be measured, and any variation in the CD can be identified. Any topography in the wafer can be identified at this step. The initial SEM measurements are used as feed-forward information for the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">At node <b>912</b>, the feed-forward information is compared with the target CD data to determine an initial desired bias for the process.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the model <b>916</b> may identify the cold spots in the wafer (based on the CD data), and assume that each of the heating elements <b>840</b> is moved as much as possible towards the nearest cold spot. Then the heating power to be supplied to each of the heating elements <b>840</b> is estimated. A thermal module (not shown) within the model <b>916</b> can calculate the temperature distribution throughout the wafer based on the heat input values. The temperature distribution can then be input to a CD module (not shown) which estimates the CD at a plurality of locations on the wafer based on the estimated temperature distribution. If the predicted CD uniformity is within a convergence criterion, then the model can output this set of heating element positions and power levels to the controller <b>850</b>, for use in the next process run. If the convergence criterion is not met, then the model <b>916</b> may perform additional iterations by re-running the temperature distribution prediction and CD distribution projection using a different set of heater input power levels. After plural iterations, if none of the sets of heater positions and power levels satisfies the model's convergence criterion, then the set of positions and heating powers providing the best predicted CDU is selected. In some embodiments, the automatic process controller will calculate the predicted CD base on the input from nodes <b>914</b> and <b>912</b>. The CD mean may be compensated by using the stepper to adjust the exposure dose, and the CD uniformity (CDU) may be controlled by the hot-plate with this flexible temperature control unit.</div>
