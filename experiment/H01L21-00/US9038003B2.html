<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the production or manufacturing of semiconductor devices, such as integrated circuits, optical lithography may be used to fabricate the semiconductor devices. Optical lithography is a printing process in which a lithographic mask or photomask manufactured from a reticle is used to transfer patterns to a substrate such as a semiconductor or silicon wafer to create the integrated circuit (I.C.). Other substrates could include flat panel displays, holographic masks or even other reticles. While conventional optical lithography uses a light source having a wavelength of 193 nm, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or X-ray lithography are also considered types of optical lithography in this application. The reticle or multiple reticles may contain a circuit pattern corresponding to an individual layer of the integrated circuit, and this pattern can be imaged onto a certain area on the substrate that has been coated with a layer of radiation-sensitive material known as photoresist or resist. Once the patterned layer is transferred the layer may undergo various other processes such as etching, ion-implantation (doping), metallization, oxidation, and polishing. These processes are employed to finish an individual layer in the substrate. If several layers are required, then the whole process or variations thereof will be repeated for each new layer. Eventually, a combination of multiples of devices or integrated circuits will be present on the substrate. These integrated circuits may then be separated from one another by dicing or sawing and then may be mounted into individual packages. In the more general case, the patterns on the substrate may be used to define artifacts such as display pixels, holograms, directed self-assembly (DSA) guard bands, or magnetic recording heads. Conventional optical lithography writing machines typically reduce the photomask pattern by a factor of four during the optical lithographic process. Therefore, patterns formed on the reticle or mask must be four times larger than the size of the desired pattern on the substrate or wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the production or manufacturing of semiconductor devices, such as integrated circuits, non-optical methods may be used to transfer a pattern on a lithographic mask to a substrate such as a silicon wafer. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is an example of a non-optical lithography process. In nanoimprint lithography, a lithographic mask pattern is transferred to a surface through contact of the lithography mask with the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Two common types of charged particle beam lithography are variable shaped beam (VSB) and character projection (CP). These are both sub-categories of shaped beam charged particle beam lithography, in which a precise electron beam is shaped and steered so as to expose a resist-coated surface, such as the surface of a wafer or the surface of a reticle. In VSB, these shapes are simple shapes, usually limited to rectangles of certain minimum and maximum sizes and with sides which are parallel to the axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane (i.e. of “manhattan” orientation), and 45 degree right triangles (i.e. triangles with their three internal angles being 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees) of certain minimum and maximum sizes. At predetermined locations, doses of electrons are shot into the resist with these simple shapes. The total writing time for this type of system increases with the number of shots. In character projection (CP), there is a stencil in the system that has in it a variety of apertures or characters which may be complex shapes such as rectilinear, arbitrary-angled linear, circular, nearly circular, annular, nearly annular, oval, nearly oval, partially circular, partially nearly circular, partially annular, partially nearly annular, partially nearly oval, or arbitrary curvilinear shapes, and which may be a connected set of complex shapes or a group of disjointed sets of a connected set of complex shapes. An electron beam can be shot through a character on the stencil to efficiently produce more complex patterns on the reticle. In theory, such a system can be faster than a VSB system because it can shoot more complex shapes with each time-consuming shot. Thus, an E-shaped pattern shot with a VSB system takes four shots, but the same E-shaped pattern can be shot with one shot with a character projection system. Note that VSB systems can be thought of as a special (simple) case of character projection, where the characters are just simple characters, usually rectangles or 45-45-90 degree triangles. It is also possible to partially expose a character. This can be done by, for instance, blocking part of the particle beam. For example, the E-shaped pattern described above can be partially exposed as an F-shaped pattern or an I-shaped pattern, where different parts of the beam are cut off by an aperture. This is the same mechanism as how various sized rectangles can be shot using VSB. In this disclosure, partial projection is used to mean both character projection and VSB projection. Shaped beam charged particle beam lithography may use either a single shaped beam, or may use a plurality of shaped beams simultaneously exposing the surface, the plurality of shaped beams producing a higher writing speed than a single shaped beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As indicated, in lithography the lithographic mask or reticle comprises geometric patterns corresponding to the circuit components to be integrated onto a substrate. The patterns used to manufacture the reticle may be generated utilizing computer-aided design (CAD) software or programs. In designing the patterns the CAD program may follow a set of pre-determined design rules in order to create the reticle. These rules are set by processing, design, and end-use limitations. An example of an end-use limitation is defining the geometry of a transistor in a way in which it cannot sufficiently operate at the required supply voltage. In particular, design rules can define the space tolerance between circuit devices or interconnect lines. The design rules are, for example, used to ensure that the circuit devices or lines do not interact with one another in an undesirable manner. For example, the design rules are used so that lines do not get too close to each other in a way that may cause a short circuit. The design rule limitations reflect, among other things, the smallest dimensions that can be reliably fabricated. When referring to these small dimensions, one usually introduces the concept of a critical dimension. These are, for instance, defined as the smallest width of a line or the smallest space between two lines, those dimensions requiring exquisite control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One goal in integrated circuit fabrication by optical lithography is to reproduce the original circuit design on the substrate by use of the reticle. Integrated circuit fabricators are always attempting to use the semiconductor wafer real estate as efficiently as possible. Engineers keep shrinking the size of the circuits to allow the integrated circuits to contain more circuit elements and to use less power. As the size of an integrated circuit critical dimension is reduced and its circuit density increases, the critical dimension of the circuit pattern or physical design approaches the resolution limit of the optical exposure tool used in conventional optical lithography. As the critical dimensions of the circuit pattern become smaller and approach the resolution value of the exposure tool, the accurate transcription of the physical design to the actual circuit pattern developed on the resist layer becomes difficult. To further the use of optical lithography to transfer patterns having features that are smaller than the light wavelength used in the optical lithography process, a process known as optical proximity correction (OPC) has been developed. OPC alters the physical design to compensate for distortions caused by effects such as optical diffraction and the optical interaction of features with proximate features. OPC includes all resolution enhancement technologies performed with a reticle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">OPC may add sub-resolution lithographic features to mask patterns to reduce differences between the original physical design pattern, that is, the design, and the final transferred circuit pattern on the substrate. The sub-resolution lithographic features interact with the original patterns in the physical design and with each other and compensate for proximity effects to improve the final transferred circuit pattern. One feature that is used to improve the transfer of the pattern is a sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF). Another feature that is added to improve pattern transference is referred to as “serifs”. Serifs are small features that can be positioned on an interior or exterior corner of a pattern to sharpen the corner in the final transferred image. It is often the case that the precision demanded of the surface manufacturing process for SRAFs is less than the precision demanded for patterns that are intended to print on the substrate, often referred to as main features. Serifs are a part of a main feature. As the limits of optical lithography are being extended far into the sub-wavelength regime, the OPC features must be made more and more complex in order to compensate for even more subtle interactions and effects. As imaging systems are pushed closer to their limits, the ability to produce reticles with sufficiently fine OPC features becomes critical. Although adding serifs or other OPC features to a mask pattern is advantageous, it also substantially increases the total feature count in the mask pattern. For example, adding a serif to each of the corners of a square using conventional techniques adds eight more rectangles to a mask or reticle pattern. Adding OPC features is a very laborious task, requires costly computation time, and results in more expensive reticles. Not only are OPC patterns complex, but since optical proximity effects are long range compared to minimum line and space dimensions, the correct OPC patterns in a given location depend significantly on what other geometry is in the neighborhood. Thus, for instance, a line end will have different size serifs depending on what is near it on the reticle. This is even though the objective might be to produce exactly the same shape on the wafer. These slight but critical variations are important and have prevented others from being able to form reticle patterns. It is conventional to discuss the OPC-decorated patterns to be written on a reticle in terms of designed features, that is features that reflect the design before OPC decoration, and OPC features, where OPC features might include serifs, jogs, and SRAF. To quantify what is meant by slight variations, a typical slight variation in OPC decoration from neighborhood to neighborhood might be 5% to 80% of a designed feature size. Note that for clarity, variations in the design of the OPC are what is being referenced. Manufacturing variations, such as line-edge roughness and corner rounding, will also be present in the actual surface patterns. When these OPC variations produce substantially the same patterns on the wafer, what is meant is that the geometry on the wafer is targeted to be the same within a specified error, which depends on the details of the function that that geometry is designed to perform, e.g., a transistor or a wire. Nevertheless, typical specifications are in the 2%-50% of a designed feature range. There are numerous manufacturing factors that also cause variations, but the OPC component of that overall error is often in the range listed. OPC shapes such as sub-resolution assist features are subject to various design rules, such as a rule based on the size of the smallest feature that can be transferred to the wafer using optical lithography. Other design rules may come from the mask manufacturing process or, if a character projection charged particle beam writing system is used to form the pattern on a reticle, from the stencil manufacturing process. It should also be noted that the accuracy requirement of the SRAF features on the mask may be lower than the accuracy requirements for the designed features on the mask. As process nodes continue to shrink, the size of the smallest SRAFs on a photomask also shrinks For example, at the 20 nm logic process node, 40 nm to 60 nm SRAFs are needed on the mask for the highest precision layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Inverse lithography technology (ILT) is one type of OPC technique. ILT is a process in which a pattern to be formed on a reticle is directly computed from a pattern which is desired to be formed on a substrate such as a silicon wafer. This may include simulating the optical lithography process in the reverse direction, using the desired pattern on the substrate as input. ILT-computed reticle patterns may be purely curvilinear—i.e. completely non-rectilinear—and may include circular, nearly circular, annular, nearly annular, oval and/or nearly oval patterns. Since these ideal ILT curvilinear patterns are difficult and expensive to form on a reticle using conventional techniques, rectilinear approximations or rectilinearizations of the ideal curvilinear patterns may be used. The rectilinear approximations decrease accuracy, however, compared to the ideal ILT curvilinear patterns. Additionally, if the rectilinear approximations are produced from the ideal ILT curvilinear patterns, the overall calculation time is increased compared to ideal ILT curvilinear patterns. In this disclosure ILT, OPC, source mask optimization (SMO), and computational lithography are terms that are used interchangeably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In EUV lithography, OPC features are generally not required. Therefore, the complexity of the pattern to be manufactured on the reticle is less than with conventional 193 nm wavelength optical lithography, and shot count reduction is correspondingly less important. In EUV, however, mask accuracy requirements are very high because the patterns on the mask, which are typically 4× the size of the patterns on the wafer, are sufficiently small that they are challenging to form precisely using charged particle beam technology such as electron beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">There are a number of technologies used for forming patterns on a reticle, including using optical lithography or charged particle beam lithography. The most commonly used system is the variable shaped beam (VSB), where, as described above, doses of electrons with simple shapes such as manhattan rectangles and 45-degree right triangles expose a resist-coated reticle surface. In conventional mask writing, the doses or shots of electrons are designed to avoid overlap wherever possible, so as to greatly simplify calculation of how the resist on the reticle will register the pattern. Similarly, the set of shots is designed so as to completely cover the pattern area that is to be formed on the reticle. U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,401, owned by the assignee of the present patent application and incorporated by reference for all purposes, discloses a method of mask writing in which intentional shot overlap for writing patterns is used. When overlapping shots are used, charged particle beam simulation can be used to determine the pattern that the resist on the reticle will register. Use of overlapping shots may allow patterns to be written with reduced shot count. U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,401 also discloses use of dose modulation, where the assigned dosages of shots vary with respect to the dosages of other shots. The term model-based fracturing is used to describe the process of determining shots using the techniques of U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,401.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Reticle writing for the most advanced technology nodes typically involves multiple passes of charged particle beam writing, a process called multi-pass exposure, whereby the given shape on the reticle is written and overwritten. Typically, two to four passes are used to write a reticle to average out precision errors in the charged particle beam writer, allowing the creation of more accurate photomasks. Also typically, the list of shots, including the dosages, is the same for every pass. In one variation of multi-pass exposure, the lists of shots may vary among exposure passes, but the union of the shots in any exposure pass covers the same area. Multi-pass writing can reduce over-heating of the resist coating the surface. Multi-pass writing also averages out random errors of the charged particle beam writer. Multi-pass writing using different shot lists for different exposure passes can also reduce the effects of certain systemic errors in the writing process.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure is related to lithography, and more particularly to the design and manufacture of a surface which may be a reticle, a wafer, or any other surface, using charged particle beam lithography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numbers refer to like items, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a lithography system, such as a charged particle beam writer system, in this case an electron beam writer system <b>10</b>, that employs a variable shaped beam (VSB) to manufacture a surface <b>12</b>. The electron beam writer system <b>10</b> has an electron beam source <b>14</b> that projects an electron beam <b>16</b> toward an aperture plate <b>18</b>. The plate <b>18</b> has an aperture <b>20</b> formed therein which allows the electron beam <b>16</b> to pass. Once the electron beam <b>16</b> passes through the aperture <b>20</b> it is directed or deflected by a system of lenses (not shown) as electron beam <b>22</b> toward another rectangular aperture plate or stencil mask <b>24</b>. The stencil <b>24</b> has formed therein a number of openings or apertures <b>26</b> that define various simple shapes such as rectangles and triangles. Each aperture <b>26</b> formed in the stencil <b>24</b> may be used to form a pattern in the surface <b>12</b> of a substrate <b>34</b>, such as a silicon wafer, a reticle or other substrate. An electron beam <b>30</b> emerges from one of the apertures <b>26</b> and passes through an electromagnetic or electrostatic reduction lens <b>38</b>, which reduces the size of the pattern emerging from the aperture <b>26</b>. In commonly available charged particle beam writer systems, the reduction factor is between 10 and 60. The reduced electron beam <b>40</b> emerges from the reduction lens <b>38</b> and is directed by a series of deflectors <b>42</b> onto the surface <b>12</b> as a pattern <b>28</b>. The surface <b>12</b> is coated with resist (not shown) which reacts with the electron beam <b>40</b>. The electron beam <b>22</b> may be directed to overlap a variable portion of an aperture <b>26</b>, affecting the size and shape of the pattern <b>28</b>. Blanking plates (not shown) are used to deflect the beam <b>16</b> or the shaped beam <b>22</b> so to prevent the electron beam from reaching the surface <b>12</b> during a period after each shot when the lenses directing the beam <b>22</b> and the deflectors <b>42</b> are being re-adjusted for the succeeding shot. Typically the blanking plates are positioned so as to deflect the electron beam <b>16</b> to prevent it from illuminating aperture <b>20</b>. The blanking period may be a fixed length of time, or it may vary depending, for example, on how much the deflector <b>42</b> must be re-adjusted for the position of the succeeding shot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In electron beam writer system <b>10</b>, the substrate <b>34</b> is mounted on a movable platform <b>32</b>. The platform <b>32</b> allows substrate <b>34</b> to be repositioned so that patterns which are larger than the maximum deflection capability or field size of the charged particle beam <b>40</b> may be written to surface <b>12</b> in a series of subfields, where each subfield is within the capability of deflector <b>42</b> to deflect the beam <b>40</b>. In one embodiment the substrate <b>34</b> may be a reticle. In this embodiment, the reticle, after being exposed with the pattern, undergoes various manufacturing steps through which it becomes a lithographic mask or photomask. The mask may then be used in an optical lithography machine to project an image of the reticle pattern <b>28</b>, generally reduced in size, onto a silicon wafer to produce an integrated circuit. More generally, the mask is used in another device or machine to transfer the pattern <b>28</b> on to a substrate (not illustrated).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a charged particle beam system in which a single beam <b>40</b> illuminates the surface <b>12</b>, some charged particle beam writers can simultaneously illuminate a surface with a plurality of beams, which may or may not be independently adjustable and positionable. Multi-beam charged particle beam writers generally have higher writing speeds than single-beam writers. Some types of multi-beam writers are shaped beam, while in others the beams are scanned across the surface. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term “shot” includes exposure information for both shaped beam and scanned beam multi-beam writers, as well as for shaped single-beam writers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The minimum size pattern that can be projected with reasonable accuracy onto a surface <b>12</b> is limited by a variety of short-range physical effects associated with the electron beam writer system <b>10</b> and with the surface <b>12</b>, which normally comprises a resist coating on the substrate <b>34</b>. These effects include forward scattering, Coulomb effect, and resist diffusion. Beam blur, also called β<sub>f</sub>, is a term used to include all of these short-range effects. The most modern electron beam writer systems can achieve an effective beam blur radius or β<sub>f </sub>in the range of 20 nm to 30 nm. Forward scattering may constitute one quarter to one half of the total beam blur. Modern electron beam writer systems contain numerous mechanisms to reduce each of the constituent pieces of beam blur to a minimum. Since some components of beam blur are a function of the calibration level of a particle beam writer, the β<sub>f </sub>of two particle beam writers of the same design may differ. The diffusion characteristics of resists may also vary. Variation of β<sub>f </sub>based on shot size or shot dose can be simulated and systemically accounted for. But there are other effects that cannot or are not accounted for, and they appear as random variation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The shot dosage of a charged particle beam writer such as an electron beam writer system is a function of the intensity of the beam source <b>14</b> and the exposure time for each shot. Typically the beam intensity remains nominally fixed, and the exposure time is varied to obtain variable shot dosages. The exposure time may be varied to compensate for various long-range effects such as back scatter, fogging and loading effects in a process called proximity effect correction (PEC). Electron beam writer systems usually allow setting an overall dosage, called a base dosage, which affects all shots in an exposure pass. Some electron beam writer systems perform dosage compensation calculations within the electron beam writer system itself, and do not allow the dosage of each shot to be assigned individually as part of the input shot list, the input shots therefore having unassigned shot dosages. In such electron beam writer systems all shots implicitly have the base dosage, before PEC. Other electron beam writer systems do allow explicit dosage assignment on a shot-by-shot basis. In electron beam writer systems that allow shot-by-shot dosage assignment, the number of available dosage levels may be 64 to 4096 or more, or there may be a relatively few available dosage levels, such as 3 to 8 levels. For scanned multi-beam systems, dosage adjustment may be done by scanning the surface multiple times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Conventionally, shots are designed so as to completely cover an input pattern with rectangular shots, while avoiding shot overlap wherever possible. Also, all shots are designed to have a normal dosage, which is a dosage at which a relatively large rectangular shot, in the absence of long-range effects, will produce a pattern on the surface which is the same size as is the shot size. Some electron beam writer systems enforce this methodology by not allowing shots to overlap within an exposure pass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In exposing, for example, a repeated pattern on a surface using charged particle beam lithography, the size of each pattern instance, as measured on the final manufactured surface, will be slightly different, due to manufacturing variations. The amount of the size variation is an essential manufacturing optimization criterion. In current mask masking, a root mean square (RMS) variation of no more than 1 nm (1 sigma) in pattern size may be desired. More size variation translates to more variation in circuit performance, leading to higher design margins being required, making it increasingly difficult to design faster, lower-power integrated circuits. This variation is referred to as critical dimension (CD) variation. A low CD variation is desirable, and indicates that manufacturing variations will produce relatively small size variations on the final manufactured surface. In the smaller scale, the effects of a high CD variation may be observed as line edge roughness (LER). LER is caused by each part of a line edge being slightly differently manufactured, leading to some waviness in a line that is intended to have a straight edge. CD variation is, among other things, inversely related to the slope of the dosage curve at the resist threshold, which is called edge slope. Therefore, edge slope, or dose margin, is a critical optimization factor for particle beam writing of surfaces. In this disclosure, edge slope and dose margin are terms that are used interchangeably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">With conventional fracturing, without shot overlap, gaps or dose modulation, the dose margin of the written shapes is considered immutable: that is, there is no opportunity to improve dose margin by a choice of fracturing options. In modern practice, the avoidance of very narrow shots called slivers is an example of a practical rule-based method that helps to optimize the shot list for dose margin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In a fracturing environment where overlapping shots and dose-modulated shots can be generated, there is both a need and an opportunity to optimize for dose margin. The additional flexibility in shot combinations allowed by use of shot overlap and dose modulation allows generation of fracturing solutions that appear to generate the target mask shapes on the surface, but may do so only under perfect manufacturing conditions. The use of overlapping shots and dose-modulated shots therefore creates incentive to address the issue of dose margin and its improvement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> illustrate how critical dimension variation can be reduced by exposing the pattern on the resist so as to produce a relatively high edge slope in the exposure or dosage curve, such as is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0096412 published on Apr. 19, 2012, entitled “Method and System for Forming High Accuracy Patterns Using Charged Particle Beam Lithography,” which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional dosage curve <b>202</b>, where the x-axis shows the cross-sectional distance through an exposed pattern—such as the distance perpendicular to two of the pattern's edges—and the y-axis shows the dosage received by the resist. A pattern is registered by the resist where the received dosage is higher than a threshold. Two thresholds are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, illustrating the effect of a variation in resist sensitivity. The higher threshold <b>204</b> causes a pattern of width <b>214</b> to be registered by the resist. The lower threshold <b>206</b> causes a pattern of width <b>216</b> to be registered by the resist, where width <b>216</b> is greater than width <b>214</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates another cross-sectional dosage curve <b>222</b>. Two thresholds are illustrated, where threshold <b>224</b> is the same as threshold <b>204</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and threshold <b>226</b> is the same as threshold <b>206</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The slope of dosage curve <b>222</b> is higher in the vicinity of the two thresholds than is the slope of dosage curve <b>202</b>. For dosage curve <b>222</b>, the higher threshold <b>224</b> causes a pattern of width <b>234</b> to be registered by the resist. The lower threshold <b>226</b> causes a pattern of width <b>236</b> to be registered by the resist. As can be seen, the difference between width <b>236</b> and width <b>234</b> is less than the difference between width <b>216</b> and width <b>214</b>, due to the higher edge slope of dosage curve <b>222</b> compared to dosage curve <b>202</b>. If the resist-coated surface is a reticle, then the lower sensitivity of curve <b>222</b> to variation in resist threshold can cause the pattern width on a photomask manufactured from the reticle to be closer to the target pattern width for the photomask, thereby increasing the yield of usable integrated circuits when the photomask is used to transfer a pattern to a substrate such as a silicon wafer. Similar improvement in tolerance to variation in dose for each shot is observed for dose curves with higher edge slopes. Achieving a relatively higher edge slope such as in dosage curve <b>222</b> is therefore desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, process variations can cause the width of a pattern on a photomask to vary from the intended or target width. The pattern width variation on the photomask will cause a pattern width variation on a wafer which has been exposed using the photomask in an optical lithographic process. The sensitivity of the wafer pattern width to variations in photomask pattern width is called mask edge error factor, or MEEF. In an optical lithography system using a 4× photomask, where the optical lithographic process projects a 4× reduced version of the photomask pattern onto the wafer, a MEEF of 1, for example, means that for each 1 nm error in pattern width on a photomask, the pattern width on the wafer will change by 0.25 nm. A MEEF of 2 means that for a 1 nm error in photomask pattern width, the pattern width on the wafer will change by 0.5 nm. For the smallest integrated circuits processes, MEEF may be greater than 2.</div>

The CD of pattern <b>352</b> is its perpendicular width—that is the dimension in the direction perpendicular to the longest dimension of the path.

As can be seen, the perpendicular width of path <b>352</b> is nowhere determined by a single shot. For example, along line <b>330</b> shots <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> determine the CD, thereby creating a CD split along line <b>330</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The CDU of a pattern to be formed on a reticle may be more accurately modeled by accounting for the random and systematic variations inherent in the charged particle beam lithography process. In one embodiment, a Monte Carlo method may be used to account for these variations. In this way the CDU of a pattern such as a linear track may be calculated stochastically using Monte Carlo analysis. The CDU of a track may be determined based on a plurality of unique Monte Carlo simulations, where for each simulation, each shot comprising the track is subjected to variation in one or more manufacturing parameters. For each unique Monte Carlo simulation the reticle image from the set of varied shots is calculated. For each calculated reticle image, the pattern CD is measured. The measurement may use a technique similar to that commonly used in making physical scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements of manufactured patterns on reticles. The resulting aggregate of measurements from the plurality of unique Monte Carlo simulations, with each simulation having a measured CD, comprises a CD distribution. Groups of VSB, CP or combined VSB and CP shots may be analyzed in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of a CD distribution graph <b>600</b> using a variety of shot configurations that may be used to form a track. In this example the track is a non-manhattan linear track where the track has a nominal design width of 100 nm. Three shot configurations were analyzed:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0051">Curve <b>610</b>: Conventional non-overlapping VSB shots, using the conventionally-calculated shot dimensions based on the track's angle and 100 nm width.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0052">Curve <b>612</b>: Overlapping VSB shots. A configuration of overlapping VSB shots was determined using model-based techniques, such that the shot configuration can form a track of 100 nm, where the shot-to-shot spacing, and therefore the shot count, was the same as the conventional non-overlapping shot configuration above.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0053">Curve <b>614</b>: Overlapping circular character projection shots. A circular shot configuration was determined that can form a track of 100 nm, where the shot-to-shot spacing, and therefore the shot count, was the same as the conventional non-overlapping shot configuration above.
<br/>
In this experiment, all three shot configurations used the same pre-PEC dosage, before the effects of manufacturing variation were added. In other embodiments, shots with different assigned dosages, with the resultant dose margin variation, are also possible. Additionally, in other embodiments, sliver reduction may be varied. Using Monte Carlo techniques, the effects of manufacturing variation on CDU were then calculated for tracks formed using each shot configuration. Two parameters were varied:
</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0054">Shot dosage was varied using a normal distribution, with a sigma of 5% of a normal dosage.</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0055">The position of each shot was varied using a normal distribution, with a sigma of 1.5 nm. For shot configurations in which CD split exists, varying shot position will model the effects of the CD split.
<br/>
In some embodiments shot size could also be varied, although in the experiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> it was not. Size variation could include factors such as width, height, or width and height together. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the results of this experiment in the graph <b>600</b> which shows the probability distributions of CDs for a linear non-manhattan track formed using the shot configurations listed above for curves <b>610</b>, <b>612</b> and <b>614</b>. The x-axis of graph <b>600</b> is the CD, where 100.0 nm is the design width. The y-axis of graph <b>600</b> is a relative probability. The area under each of the three curves is equal, since the sum of all CD probabilities is unity. The 1-sigma of each CD curve is:
</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0056">Curve <b>610</b>: 0.49 nm</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0057">Curve <b>612</b>: 0.33 nm</li> <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0058">Curve <b>614</b>: 0.32 nm
<br/>
Additionally, the LWR of the various shot configurations is:
</li> <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0059">Conventional non-overlapping shots (curve <b>610</b>): 4.13 nm</li> <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0060">Optimized overlapping VSB shots (curve <b>612</b>): 2.83 nm</li> <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0061">Optimized overlapping circular CP shots (curve <b>614</b>): 2.70 nm
<br/>
The use of overlapping shots this example illustrates that CDU and LWR may both be improved, compared with conventional shots. Furthermore, use of circular CP shots may provide more improvement than use of VSB shots. Other sets of overlapping VSB shots using the same shot-to-shot spacing may display an even better CDU than CD distribution <b>612</b>. Similarly, other sets of CP shots using the same shot-to-shot spacing may display an ever better CDU than CD distribution <b>614</b>.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0062">Similar techniques may be used to calculate the CDU of curvilinear tracks, and to calculate the dimensional variability of more general reticle patterns. Although the term “critical dimension” is commonly applied only to tracks, the similar term “wafer critical dimension” refers to the desired dimensions of arbitrary patterns in a physical design. The techniques set forth for optimizing CDU can also be used to optimize wafer critical dimension uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0063">In the experiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, shot-to-shot spacing is constant in the various shot configurations. In general, however, shot-to-shot spacing may also be varied. If shot-to-shot spacing is increased, for example, the number of shots decreases, and therefore the time required to write the pattern on a reticle decreases. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates CD distributions for a conventional set of shots and two configurations of overlapping shots:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0064">Curve <b>710</b> illustrates a CD distribution for a set of conventional non-overlapping VSB shots. The 6 sigma CDU is 4.8 nm.</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0065">Curve <b>712</b> illustrates a CD distribution for a CDU-optimized set of overlapping VSB shots, where the write time is the same as for the conventional non-overlapping shots. The 6 sigma CDU is 3.2 nm.</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0066">Curve <b>714</b> illustrates a CD distribution for a CDU-optimized set of overlapping VSB shots, where the write time is 70% of the write time for the conventional non-overlapping shots. The 6 sigma CDU is 4.8 nm.
<br/>
As in the experiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, manufacturing variation in shot dosage and shot position were calculated in this experiment. In this experiment, all three shot configurations used the same pre-PEC dosage, before the effects of manufacturing variation were added. In other embodiments, shots with different assigned dosages, with the resultant dose margin variation, are also possible. The CDU distributions illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> show that the flexibility allowed by using overlapping shots allow CDU to be improved over conventional non-overlapping shots while maintaining write time, or allow write time to be reduced while maintaining CDU. Other solutions may be found in between these two solutions, where CDU and write time are simultaneously improved.

A CD is measured at one or more locations for each calculated reticle pattern. CDUs are calculated for each location using the CDs from each of the plurality of calculated reticle patterns. CDUs that are larger than a pre-determined tolerance are non-conforming, and are output to an exception report <b>1012</b>. In some embodiments, shot verification <b>1010</b> may comprise double simulation, where an aerial image on a substrate such as a wafer is calculated for each reticle pattern, such as using lithography simulation. In this case a substrate model <b>1008</b> is also input to shot verification <b>1010</b>. In these embodiments using double simulation, a CD is measured at each measurement location of each aerial image, and a substrate CDU is calculated for each measurement location from the aerial image CD of each shot list variation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0074">A shot configuration that will produce a minimum CDU for a given situation may be pre-calculated, and information about this shot configuration stored in a table. For example, a situation may be a linear track with 100 nm width, angled 40 degrees from the x-axis, for which a shot configuration is to be pre-calculated. In addition to the track itself, the situation may include the nearby environment. In this example the environment may comprise a plurality of at least 5 parallel 100 nm wide tracks on each side of the track for which shots are to be generated, with adjacent tracks separated by 100 nm spaces. In determining the best shot configuration for a given situation, other parameters may also be considered. For example, the shot configuration may be exposed onto a reticle, the reticle processed to create a photomask, the fabricated photomask pattern dimensions measured, and these measured dimensions compared to the calculated pattern dimensions, where the average difference between the calculated and measured dimension is the mean to target (MTT). Only shot configurations which have an MTT below a pre-determined value may be stored in the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0075">The calculations described or referred to in this disclosure may be accomplished in various ways. Generally, calculations may be accomplished by in-process, pre-process or post-process methods. In-process calculation involves performing a calculation at the time when its results are needed. Pre-process calculation involves pre-calculating and then storing results for later retrieval during a subsequent processing step, and may improve processing performance, particularly for calculations that may be repeated many times. Calculations may also be deferred from a processing step and then done in a later post-processing step. An example of pre-process calculation is pre-calculating a shot configuration that will produce a minimum CDU for a given situation, and storing information about this shot configuration in a table. Another example of pre-process calculation is a shot group, which is a pre-calculation of dosage pattern information for one or more shots associated with a given input pattern or set of input pattern characteristics. The shot group and the associated input pattern may be saved in a library of pre-calculated shot groups, so that the set of shots comprising the shot group can be quickly generated for additional instances of the input pattern, without pattern re-calculation. In some embodiments, the pre-calculation may comprise simulation of the dosage pattern that the shot group will produce on a resist-coated surface. In other embodiments, the shot group may be determined without simulation, such as by using correct-by-construction techniques. In some embodiments, the pre-calculated shot groups may be stored in the shot group library in the form of a list of shots. In other embodiments, the pre-calculated shot groups may be stored in the form of computer code that can generate shots for a specific type or types of input patterns. In yet other embodiments, a plurality of pre-calculated shot groups may be stored in the form of a table, where entries in the table correspond to various input patterns or input pattern characteristics such as pattern width, and where each table entry provides either a list of shots in the shot group, or information for how to generate the appropriate set of shots. Additionally, different shot groups may be stored in different forms in the shot group library. In some embodiments, the dosage pattern which a given shot group can produce may also be stored in the shot group library. In one embodiment, the dosage pattern may be stored as a two-dimensional (X and Y) dosage map called a glyph.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0076">The fracturing, mask data preparation, shot optimization and verification flows described in this disclosure may be implemented using general-purpose computers with appropriate computer software as computation devices. Due to the large amount of calculations required, multiple computers or processor cores may also be used in parallel. In one embodiment, the computations may be subdivided into a plurality of 2-dimensional geometric regions for one or more computation-intensive steps in the flow, to support parallel processing. In another embodiment, a special-purpose hardware device, either used singly or in multiples, may be used to perform the computations of one or more steps with greater speed than using general-purpose computers or processor cores. In one embodiment, the special-purpose hardware device may be a graphics processing unit (GPU). In another embodiment, the optimization and simulation processes described in this disclosure may include iterative processes of revising and recalculating possible solutions, so as to minimize either the total number of shots, or the total charged particle beam writing time, or some other parameter. In yet another embodiment, an initial set of shots may be determined in a correct-by-construction method, so that no shot modifications are required.</div>
