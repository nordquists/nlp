<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a film formation method which forms a thin film containing an impurity on a surface of an object to be processed such as a semiconductor wafer or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, various processes, such as film formation, etching, oxidation, diffusion, surface modification, native oxide removal, or the like, are performed on a semiconductor wafer including a silicon substrate or the like in order to manufacture a semiconductor integrated circuit. From among the various processes, film formation will be exemplarily explained. During manufacture of a semiconductor integrated circuit, for example, a DRAM or the like, film formation process may be performed by forming recess portions, such as contact holes, through-holes, wiring grooves, cylindrical grooves of a capacitor having a cylindrical structure, or the like, in an insulating film formed on a surface of a semiconductor wafer and filling the recess portions with a conductive thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A silicon film containing an impurity has been conventionally used as the thin film filled in the recess portions, because the silicon film has a relatively good step coverage and a relatively low cost. A method of filling the recess portions will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> are views showing an example where recess portions formed on a surface of a semiconductor wafer are filled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, an insulating film <b>2</b> formed of, for example, SiO<sub>2 </sub>or the like, is thinly formed on a surface of a semiconductor wafer W including, for example, a silicon substrate or the like, which is an object to be processed, and recess portions <b>4</b> are formed in the insulating film <b>2</b>. The recess portions <b>4</b> are contact holes for contact with a lower layer or the substrate itself, through-holes, wiring grooves, cylindrical grooves of a capacitor having a cylindrical structure, or the like. Contact holes for contact with the substrate itself are exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. And, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, a conductive thin film <b>6</b> is formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer W in order to fill the recess portions <b>4</b>. A silicon film containing an impurity is often used as the thin film <b>6</b> as described above.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">By the way, when a request for miniaturization is not so high that design rules are relatively simple, filling up the recess portions as described above is favorably performed and each of the aforesaid film formation methods has achieved good filling characteristics due to a high step coverage. However, as a request for miniaturization has increased and thus design rules become stricter in recent years, sufficient filling characteristics cannot be achieved. Also, as shown in, for example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, a void <b>8</b>, which is not negligible, is formed in a film, thereby increasing a contact resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, recently, as a strict design rule in which a hole diameter of each of recess portions <b>4</b> is equal to or less than 40 nm and an aspect ratio of each of the recess portions <b>4</b> is equal to or greater than 10 is requested, there is a demand for a method for solving the aforesaid problems at an early stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Considering the aforesaid problems, the present invention has been made to effectively solve the problems. The present invention provides a thin film formation method and a film formation apparatus which can form an amorphous thin film, such as a silicon film or a silicon germanium film containing an impurity, having good filling characteristics even at a relatively low temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">An embodiment of present invention provides the thin film formation method to form the silicon film containing an impurity on the surface of an object to be processed in the process chamber that allows vacuum exhaust, the thin film formation method includes supplying the silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen into the process chamber in the state that the silane-based gas is adsorbed onto the surface of the object without supplying the impurity-containing gas, supplying the impurity-containing gas into the process chamber to form the amorphous silicon film containing the impurity without supplying the silane-based gas, and performing the supplying of the silane-based gas and the supplying of the impurity-containing gas alternately and repeatedly such that the impurity reacts with the silane-based gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a thin film formation method and a film formation apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">&lt;First Embodiment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a structural view showing an example of a first embodiment of a film formation apparatus for performing a method of the present invention. As shown, the film formation apparatus <b>12</b> includes a batch type vertical process chamber <b>14</b> having a cylindrical shape with an open lower end. The process chamber <b>14</b> may be formed of, for example, quartz with high thermal resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">An open exhaust port <b>16</b> is provided in a ceiling portion of the process chamber <b>14</b>, and an exhaust nozzle <b>18</b>, which is bent, for example, in a horizontal direction perpendicular to a vertical direction, is continuously installed in the exhaust port <b>16</b>. And, a vacuum exhaust system <b>24</b> including a pressure control valve <b>20</b>, a vacuum pump <b>22</b>, or the like is connected to the exhaust nozzle <b>18</b>, so that an atmosphere in the process chamber <b>14</b> can be evacuated due to vacuum suction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The lower end of the process chamber <b>14</b> is supported by a manifold <b>26</b> having a cylindrical shape and formed of, for example, stainless steel, and a wafer boat <b>28</b> formed of quartz is provided as a holding unit, on which a plurality of semiconductor wafers W which are objects to be processed are stacked from a lower side of the process chamber <b>14</b> at predetermined pitches, such that the wafer boat <b>28</b> can be lowered and raised and freely inserted into and separated from the manifold <b>26</b>. A sealing member <b>30</b>, such as an O-ring or the like, is interposed between the lower end of the process chamber <b>14</b> and an upper end of the manifold <b>26</b>, to hermetically maintain a space between the lower end of the process chamber <b>14</b> and the upper end of the manifold <b>26</b>. In the present embodiment, for example, about 50 to 100 semiconductor wafers W each having a diameter of about 300 mm can be supported at substantially regular pitches on the wafer boat <b>28</b>. Also, there may be an example of an apparatus in which a portion of the manifold <b>26</b> is integrally molded with the process chamber <b>14</b> by using quartz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The wafer boat <b>28</b> is placed on a table <b>34</b> with a Dewar flask <b>32</b> formed of quartz therebetween, and the table <b>34</b> is supported on an upper end portion of a rotating shaft <b>38</b> that penetrates through a cover <b>36</b> that opens and closes a lower end opening of the manifold <b>26</b>. And, for example, a magnetic fluid seal <b>40</b> is installed in a portion of the rotating shaft <b>38</b> penetrating through the cover <b>36</b>, so that the rotating shaft <b>38</b> is hermetically sealed and rotatably supported. Also, a sealing member <b>42</b>, such as an O-ring or the like, is installed in a lower end portion of the manifold <b>26</b> and a peripheral portion of the cover <b>36</b>, so that the inside of the process chamber <b>14</b> is sealed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The rotating shaft <b>38</b> is attached to a front end of an arm <b>46</b> that is supported by a lifting mechanism <b>44</b>, for example, a boat elevator or the like, so that the wafer boat <b>28</b>, the cover <b>36</b>, and the like can be integrally lowered and raised. Also, by fixedly installing the table <b>34</b> to the cover <b>36</b>, the semiconductor wafers W may be processed without rotating the wafer boat <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">A heating unit <b>48</b> including a heater formed of a carbon wire is installed beside the process chamber <b>14</b> to surround the process chamber <b>14</b>, so that the semiconductor wafers W located inside the process chamber <b>14</b> can be heated. Also, a heat insulator <b>50</b> is installed at an outer periphery of the heating unit <b>48</b>, so that thermal stability is ensured. And, various gas supply units for introducing and supplying various gases into the process chamber <b>14</b> are installed at the manifold <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In detail, a silane-based gas supply unit <b>52</b>, which supplies a silane-based gas for film formation composed of silicon and hydrogen into the process chamber <b>14</b>, and an impurity-containing gas supply unit <b>54</b>, which supplies an impurity-containing gas into the process chamber <b>14</b>, are respectively installed at the manifold <b>26</b>. Also, here, if necessary, a support gas supply unit <b>56</b> for supplying a purge gas or a pressure adjusting gas into the process chamber <b>14</b> is installed at the manifold <b>26</b>. Here, a N<sub>2 </sub>gas is used as the purge gas or the pressure adjusting gas. Also, a rare gas, such as Ar, He, or the like, may be used instead of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The silane-based gas supply unit <b>52</b>, the impurity-containing gas supply unit <b>54</b>, and the support gas supply unit <b>56</b> respectively include gas nozzles <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, and <b>56</b>A which penetrate through a side wall of the manifold <b>26</b> and have front end portions extending into the process chamber <b>14</b>. Gas passages <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>66</b> are respectively connected to the gas nozzles <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, and <b>56</b>A, and opening/closing valves <b>62</b>A, <b>64</b>A, and <b>66</b>A and flow rate controllers <b>62</b>B, <b>64</b>B, and <b>66</b>B, such as mass flow controllers, are sequentially installed in the gas passages <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>66</b>, so that a silane-based gas, an impurity-containing gas, or a N<sub>2 </sub>gas flows at controlled flow rates. Here, a silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen as described, that is, a silane-based gas composed of only silicon and hydrogen, for example, monosilane, is used as the silane-based gas, a BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas is used as the impurity-containing gas, and the N<sub>2 </sub>gas is used as a purge gas or a pressure adjusting gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">And, a control unit <b>70</b> including, for example, a micro computer or the like, is installed in the film formation apparatus in order to control the supply of each gas to be started or stopped, a process temperature, a process pressure, and so on, or in order to control an overall operation of the film formation apparatus. The control unit <b>70</b> includes a storage medium <b>72</b> in order to store a program used to control an operation of the film formation apparatus <b>12</b>. The storage medium <b>72</b> includes, for example, a flexible disc, a CD (Compact Disc), a hard disc, a flash memory, a DVD, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, a first embodiment of a film formation method of the present invention which is performed by using the film formation apparatus <b>12</b> of the first embodiment constructed as described above will be explained. Each operation described below is performed under the control of the control unit <b>70</b> including a computer as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a timing chart showing an example of each gas supply type in the first embodiment of the method of the present invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing an example of each process of the first embodiment of the method of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref> are views schematically showing a reaction process between SiH<sub>4 </sub>and BCl<sub>3</sub>. The method of the present invention forms an amorphous silicon film containing an impurity by alternately and repeatedly performing a first gas supply process in which a silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen is supplied into the process chamber <b>14</b> in a state that the silane-based gas is adsorbed onto a surface of the semiconductor wafer W and a second gas supply process in which an impurity-containing gas is supplied into the process chamber <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the timing chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a portion where a pulse is high means that a gas is being supplied. In detail, a first gas supply process (S<b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is first performed by supplying, for example, a SiH<sub>4 </sub>(monosilane) gas, as a silane-based gas into the process chamber <b>14</b> (see a timing chart (A) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the first gas supply process, the monosilane gas is supplied in a state that the monosilane gas is adsorbed onto a surface of a semiconductor wafer W that is an object to be processed. Next, a purging process (S<b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in which a remaining gas in the process chamber <b>14</b> is removed is performed (see a timing chart (C) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Also, the purging process may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a second gas supply process (S<b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is performed by supplying, for example, a BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas, as an impurity-containing gas into the process chamber <b>14</b> (see a timing chart (B) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Accordingly, the BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas reacts with SiH<sub>4 </sub>adsorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W to form a very thin silicon film doped with boron (B) having a thickness of, for example, a 1 atomic level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, a purging process (S<b>4</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in which a remaining gas in the process chamber <b>14</b> is removed is performed again (see the timing chart (C) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Also, the purging process may be omitted. And, in step S<b>5</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is determined whether the number of times a 1 cycle including the steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> is repeated reaches a predetermined number of times. Here, the 1 cycle refers to a period of time from when a first gas supply process (S<b>1</b>) is performed to when a next first gas supply process (S<b>1</b>) is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">If it is determined in the step S<b>5</b> that the number of times the 1 cycle is repeated does not reach the predetermined number of times (NO of S<b>5</b>), the method returns to the step S<b>1</b> and the steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> are repeatedly performed until the number of times the 1 cycle is repeated reaches the predetermined number of times, to stack an amorphous silicon film doped with boron. And, if the number of times the 1 cycle is repeated reaches the predetermined number of times (YES of S<b>5</b>), film formation is finished. The film formation method is called a so-called ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Actually, first, a plurality of semiconductor wafers W which are not processed yet are supported on the wafer boat <b>28</b> in a multistage manner, are transferred from the lower side of the process chamber <b>14</b> into the process chamber <b>14</b>, which is previously heated, and are housed in a sealed state. A diameter of each of the semiconductor wafers W is, for example, 300 mm, and here, about 50 to 100 units of the semiconductor wafer W are housed. On a surface of each of the semiconductor wafers W, in a previous process, for example, an insulating layer <b>2</b> is formed as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, and recess portions <b>4</b>, such as contact holes or wiring grooves, are formed in the insulating layer <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">An atmosphere in the process chamber <b>14</b> is always vacuum sucked by the vacuum exhaust system <b>24</b> during film formation and thus a pressure in the process chamber <b>14</b> is adjusted. Also, the semiconductor wafer W is rotated at a predetermined rate during film formation by rotating the wafer boat <b>28</b>. And, various gases are sequentially and repeatedly supplied into the process chamber <b>14</b> as described above to perform the film formation. In the first gas supply process (<b>51</b>), the monosilane gas is supplied at a controlled flow rate from the gas nozzle <b>52</b>A of the silane-based gas supply unit <b>52</b>. The monosilane gas is adsorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W that is rotated while being raised in the process chamber <b>14</b>, and a residual gas is evacuated by the vacuum exhaust system <b>24</b> through the exhaust port <b>16</b> and the exhaust nozzle <b>18</b> of an upper portion of the process chamber <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Process conditions at this time are as follows: a flow rate of the monosilane gas ranges from 100 to 4000 sccm, and is, for example, about 1200 sccm, a process pressure ranges from 27 to 6665 Pa (0.2 to 50 Torr), and is, for example, about 533 Pa (4 Torr), a process temperature ranges from 350 to 600° C., and is, for example, about 400° C., and a gas supply period of time T<b>1</b> ranges from 1 to 300 sec, and is, for example, about 60 sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, if the process temperature is lower than 350° C., it is not preferable because it is difficult for monosilane to be adsorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W. Also, if the process temperature is higher than 600° C., it is not preferable because monosilane is thermally decomposed and a silicon film is deposited. Also, if the process pressure is lower than 27 Pa, it is not preferable because the pressure is too low that it is difficult for monosilane to be adsorbed. Also, if the process pressure is higher than 6665 Pa, it is not preferable because a plurality of layers of monosilane are adsorbed and it is difficult to control a concentration of boron in the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In the purging process (S<b>2</b>) right after the first gas supply process, a N<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied at a controlled flow rate from the gas nozzle <b>56</b>A of the support gas supply unit <b>56</b>. Here, the N<sub>2 </sub>gas is used as a purge gas to remove a remaining monosilane gas in the process chamber <b>14</b>. Here, the N<sub>2 </sub>gas is not supplied for an entire period of the purging process, but is supplied for a specific period, for example, the N<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied for the first half period and is not supplied for the second half period during which only vacuum suction is continuously performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Process conditions at this time are as follows: a flow rate of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas is, for example, up to about 5 slm, a process pressure ranges from 27 to 6665 Pa, a process temperature ranges from 350 to 600° C., and a purging period of time T<b>2</b> ranges from 0 to 300 sec and is, for example, about 30 sec. In the second gas supply process (S<b>3</b>) after the purging process, the BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas is supplied at a controlled flow rate from the gas nozzle <b>54</b>A of the impurity-containing gas supply unit <b>54</b>.

The BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas and the N<sub>2 </sub>gas are raised in the process chamber <b>14</b>, and the BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas reacts with the monosilane adsorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W to form an amorphous silicon film containing boron.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The 1 cycle including processes of the steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> is repeatedly performed only a predetermined number of times.

As described above, a thin film such as a very thin amorphous silicon film having a thickness of an atomic level and doped with B (boron) as an impurity is stacked, so that the silicon film can be filled with good filling characteristics in the recess portions <b>4</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>) formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, a film formation process of an amorphous silicon film doped with boron generated during the film formation will be explained with reference to a schematic view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref> are views schematically showing results obtained when simulating a film formation process of an amorphous silicon film doped with boron by using quantum chemical calculation. An activation energy eV is shown under each picture. Here, particularly, the possibility of low temperature film formation by using alternate supply (ALD method) using SiH<sub>4 </sub>and BCl<sub>3 </sub>was verified by a simulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">First, when SiH<sub>4 </sub>introduced from the outside approaches a Si—B bonding that is already formed on a surface of a semiconductor wafer (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), due to a catalysis by B atom, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, H<sub>2 </sub>is removed from SiH<sub>4 </sub>to generate SiH<sub>2 </sub>which is easily introduced into a B-adsorbing spot. In detail, an activation energy of SiH<sub>2 </sub>to the B-adsorbing spot is reduced to about 1.2 eV. Also, if B (boron) does not exist, an activation energy is about +2.4 eV. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a Si—Si bonding is continuously formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In this regard, it is deemed that since film formation is possible at a low temperature of about 350° C. at which practical film formation was impossible with supply of only SiH<sub>4 </sub>in a conventional art, and ALD film formation is performed by alternately supplying gases, a thin film having a good step coverage is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Meanwhile, in a conventional CVD method in which only SiH<sub>4 </sub>is used, practical film formation was almost impossible.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As such, in the thin film formation method of forming a silicon film containing an impurity on the surface of the semiconductor wafer W in the process chamber <b>14</b> that allows vacuum exhaust, an amorphous silicon film containing an impurity is formed by alternately and repeatedly performing the first gas supply process in which a silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen is supplied into the process chamber <b>14</b> in a state the silane-based gas is adsorbed onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W and the second gas supply process in which an impurity-containing gas is supplied into the process chamber <b>14</b>, and thereby an amorphous silicon film containing an impurity having good filling characteristics can be formed even at a relatively low temperature.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Here, since an amorphous silicon film doped with boron was formed by actually performing the method of the present invention, evaluation results thereof will be explained. Here, a silicon substrate was used as a semiconductor wafer, a silicon oxide film was formed as a base layer on a surface of the silicon substrate, and recess portions each having a hole diameter of 50 nm and an aspect ratio of 7 were formed in the silicon oxide film. And, an amorphous silicon film doped with boron as an impurity was formed on the silicon oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As a film formation method, the film formation method described above with reference to the timing charts (A) through (C) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was used. SiH<sub>4 </sub>was used as a silane-based gas, and BCl<sub>3 </sub>was used as an impurity-containing gas. Process conditions were as follows: a flow rate of a SiH<sub>4 </sub>gas was 2000 sccm, a flow rate of a BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas was 200 sccm, and a flow rate of a N<sub>2 </sub>gas was 2 slm when being used as a purge gas and was 1 slm when being used as a pressure adjusting gas. A process temperature was set to 400° C. throughout the method, and a process pressure in each of the first gas supply process and the second gas supply process was 533 Pa (4 Torr). A process period of time T<b>1</b> was 30 sec, T<b>2</b> was 30 sec, T<b>3</b> was 30 sec, and T<b>4</b> was 30 sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As such, after film formation was performed on a wafer having a surface having a trench structure, an amorphous silicon film doped with boron of 180 Å was obtained after 60 cycles. Results in this case are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view schematically showing an electron micrograph when an amorphous silicon film doped with boron is formed in recess portions by using an ALD method as described above.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, although, in the first embodiment of the film formation method, a N<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied as a purge gas in the purging processes T<b>2</b> and T<b>4</b> and is supplied as a pressure adjusting gas in the second gas supply process as shown in the timing chart (C) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the N<sub>2 </sub>gas may be supplied as described below. Timing charts (D) through (F) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show a modified example of a N<sub>2 </sub>gas supply type.

As such, a purge gas or a pressure adjusting gas may be supplied in various manners. The reason why a pressure adjusting gas is supplied in the second gas supply process as described above is that if a pressure is changed drastically in first and second gas supply processes, silicon migration easily occurs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, a second embodiment of the film formation apparatus and the thin film formation method of the present invention will be explained.

In this case, a flow rate of a germanium-based gas in the first gas supply process ranges from 100 to 2000 sccm, and is, for example, about 500 sccm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Also, it would be understood that although various N<sub>2 </sub>gas supply types have been explained in the first embodiment with reference to the timing charts (D) through (F) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the various supply types may apply to the second embodiment.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, a third embodiment of the method of the present invention will be explained. While an amorphous silicon film doped with boron is formed as a thin film in the first embodiment and an amorphous silicon germanium film doped with boron is formed as a thin film in the second embodiment in the film formation method as described above, a combination thereof may be possible. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9C</figref> are views for explaining a process of the third embodiment of the method of the present invention. Here, a case where each thin film is formed on a conductive film and then an annealing process is additionally and finally performed will be exemplarily explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a conductive film <b>90</b> is formed on a surface of a semiconductor wafer W as an object to be processed. For example, a TiN film or the like which is often used as an electrode is used as the conductive film <b>90</b>. An amorphous silicon film <b>92</b> doped with boron is formed as a thin film on the conductive film <b>90</b> by using the first embodiment or its modified embodiment of the film formation method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, an amorphous silicon germanium film <b>94</b> doped with boron is formed as a thin film on the silicon film <b>92</b> by using the second embodiment or its modified example of the film formation method. Here, a thickness of the silicon film <b>92</b> is equal to or less than, for example, 2 nm, and a thickness of the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> is equal to or less than, for example, 90 nm. In this case, if the film formation apparatus of the second embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is used, the silicon film <b>92</b> and the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> can be continuously formed with one film formation apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, an annealing process is performed on each thin film to diffuse and mix germanium of the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> in both the thin films <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, thereby forming a mixed film <b>96</b>. A temperature of the annealing process ranges from, for example, 410 to 500° C. Also, the annealing process may be performed and may not be performed, if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, since a thickness of the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> is, for example, 90 nm which is thick, it is preferable that when the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> is formed, the silicon germanium film <b>94</b> is formed to a middle thickness, for example, about 10 nm by using the second embodiment of the film formation method, and a silicon germanium film doped with boron may be formed to a remaining thickness of 80 nm by using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method that is a conventional film formation method. Even in this case, it is preferable that an annealing process is finally performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">As such, by forming the mixed film <b>96</b>, in order to fill recess portions, for example, trench portions, if a B—Si film doped with boron is formed as a seed layer and then a B—SiGe film doped with boron is formed, a good step coverage and excellent filling characteristics can be obtained even at low temperature film formation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, an application example of a semiconductor device using a thin film formed by the method of the present invention will be explained. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing an example of a semiconductor device using a thin film formed by the method of the present invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">That is, the capacitor <b>102</b> has a lower electrode <b>106</b> formed along an inner wall of the cylindrical groove <b>104</b> having the recess shape, and a high dielectric constant film <b>108</b> and an upper electrode <b>110</b> are sequentially stacked on the lower electrode <b>106</b>. For example, a TiN film may be used as each of the lower electrode <b>106</b> and the upper electrode <b>110</b>, and for example, zirconium oxide (ZrO) may be used for the high dielectric constant film <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">And, the cylindrical groove <b>104</b> is filled in by forming a conductive film <b>112</b> on the upper electrode <b>110</b>, and a wiring film <b>114</b> including, for example, a tungsten film, is formed on the conductive film <b>112</b> by using sputtering or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">When the cylindrical groove <b>104</b> of the capacitor <b>102</b> having the cylindrical structure is filled, a conventional film formation method of forming a silicon germanium film doped with boron by using, for example, a CVD method, cannot achieve a sufficient step coverage and thus is not practical. However, by employing the film formation method according to the method of the present invention as described above, the cylindrical groove <b>104</b> can be filled with a high step coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Also, due to the thin film formed by the method of the present invention as described above, that is, the silicon film <b>92</b>, the silicon germanium film <b>94</b>, or the mixed film <b>96</b>, durability against mechanical stress between the wiring film <b>114</b> formed by using sputtering and the upper electrode <b>110</b> formed of a TiN film can be improved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In the fourth embodiment, instead of a thick TiN film as the upper electrode <b>110</b> as described above, a stacked film <b>122</b> obtained by alternately and repeatedly forming a plurality of times a thin TiN film <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and the thin amorphous silicon film <b>92</b> doped with boron formed by the method of the present invention is used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In order to form the TiN film <b>120</b>, a titan-containing gas supply unit and a nitridation gas supply unit may be provided in the film formation apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>6</b>, and these gases may be supplied at controlled flow rates.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, although an N<sub>2 </sub>gas is used as a purge gas in each purging process or as a pressure adjusting gas in the second gas supply process in each embodiment of the film formation method, a rare gas, such as Ar, He, or the like, may be used instead of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas. Also, although an N<sub>2 </sub>gas is used as a purge gas in each purging process or as a pressure adjusting gas in the second gas supply process in each embodiment of the film formation method, a H<sub>2 </sub>gas may be used alone or by being mixed with the N<sub>2 </sub>gas or the rare gas, instead of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas or the rare gas. In particular, if the H<sub>2 </sub>gas is used, the H<sub>2 </sub>gas suppresses silicon migration to prevent particles of a silicon film from being attached, thereby further improving filling characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Although a pressure adjusting gas is mainly supplied in the second gas supply process in each embodiment of the film formation method, a pressure adjusting gas may be supplied in the first gas supply process instead of the second supply process, or in both the first and second gas supply processes. Also, although monosilane is exemplarily used as a silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen in each embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto, and one or more types of gas selected from the group consisting of monosilane and higher order silane such as disilane, trisilane, tetrasilane, or the like may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Also, although a BCl<sub>3 </sub>gas is used in order to contain an impurity (dopant) in an amorphous silicon film or a silicon germanium film in each embodiment of the film formation method, the present invention is not limited thereto, and one or more types of gas selected from the group consisting of BCl<sub>3</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>, PF<sub>3</sub>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>may be used as the impurity-containing gas and various impurities may be doped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Also, although as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, a single-tube batch type film formation apparatus in which the process chamber <b>14</b> is provided in a single layer is exemplarily explained here, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the present invention can be applied to a double-tube batch type film formation apparatus in which the process chamber <b>14</b> includes an inner container and an outer container. Also, although the gas nozzles <b>52</b>A, <b>54</b>A, <b>56</b>A, and <b>80</b>A are each a straight-type gas nozzle in which a gas is ejected only from a leading end of the gas nozzle, the present invention is not limited thereto, and a so-called distribution-type gas nozzle in which a plurality of gas ejection holes are provided at predetermined pitches in a gas pipe disposed along a longitudinal direction of the process chamber <b>14</b> and a gas is ejected from each of the gas ejection holes may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Also, although a batch type film formation apparatus which processes a plurality of semiconductor wafers W at one time as described above is exemplarily explained, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the present invention can be applied to a so-called single wafer type film formation apparatus which processes one semiconductor wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Also, although, here, a semiconductor wafer is exemplarily explained as an object to be processed, the semiconductor wafer may be a silicon substrate, or a compound semiconductor substrate, such as GaAs, SiC, GaN, or the like, and also the present invention is not limited thereto, and the present invention can be applied to a glass substrate used in a liquid crystal display device, a ceramic substrate, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The thin film formation method and the film formation apparatus according to the present invention can have the following excellent effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the thin film formation method to form the silicon film containing an impurity on the surface of an object to be processed in the process chamber that allows vacuum exhaust, the thin film formation method includes supplying the silane-based gas composed of silicon and hydrogen into the process chamber in the state that the silane-based gas is adsorbed onto the surface of the object without supplying the impurity-containing gas, supplying the impurity-containing gas into the process chamber to form the amorphous silicon film containing the impurity without supplying the silane-based gas, and performing the supplying of the silane-based gas and the supplying of the impurity-containing gas alternately and repeatedly such that the impurity reacts with the silane-based gas, and thereby the amorphous silicon film containing an impurity having good filling characteristics can be formed even at a relatively low temperature.</div>
