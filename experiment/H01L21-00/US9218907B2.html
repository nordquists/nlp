<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to thin film materials, suitable for ferroelectric tunable devices and/or decoupling thin film capacitors based on such materials, and methods of manufacturing thin film devices, and more particularly, to paraelectric perovskite oxynitride nanocomposite materials and methods of making such materials for use in forming varactor devices with improved voltage tunabilities and high capacitance density thin film decoupling capacitors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to achieve maximum tunability of a ferroelectric varactor, a maximum voltage must be applied to induce a change in the dielectric constant needed to produce the maximum possible shift in capacitance. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a typical tunability achieved with a ferroelectric varactor using a thin-film ferroelectric material, such as (Ba,Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> corresponds to FIG. 7 of U.S. 2009/0069274.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. 2009/0069274 discloses a tunability of 2.8:1 under an electric field of 450 kV/cm to 500 kV/cm or a 70% reduction of the original capacitance under a 450 kV/cm bias field as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Additional examples reported typical tunabilities for 100 nm to 200 nm thick (Ba,Sr)TiO<sub>3 </sub>(BST) films used in parallel plate Pt/BST/Pt MIM type variable capacitors (varactors) in the range of 4:1 at 11 Volts (see, for example, FIG. 5 of U.S. 2007/0069274) to 6.3:1 at 10 Volts as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which corresponds to FIG. 5 of T. Bernacki, I. Koutsaroff, and C. Divita, “Barium Strontium Titanate Thin-Film Multi-Layer Capacitors”, Passive Component Industry Magazine, September/October 2004, pp. 11-13.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Oxynitrides perovskites can often be described as derivatives of oxides, formed by simultaneous substitutions (charge equivalency (balance) rule) of cation and anion components. The higher anionic charge resulting from the N<sup>3−</sup>/O<sup>2−</sup> substitution can be compensated according to two different principles. In the first case, a cross-substitution is applied with trivalent RE<sup>3+</sup> (rare earth) elements as suitable substitutes, for instance, for divalent alkaline-earth cations. For example, the oxynitride “charge balance equivalent” to BaTiO<sub>3 </sub>will be LaTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1</sub>, or NdTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1</sub>. Another example for charge compensation in AB(ON)<sub>3 </sub>oxynitrides perovskites, is simultaneous substitution of the Ti<sup>4+</sup> with Me<sup>5+</sup> and partial substitution of O<sup>2−</sup> sites with N<sup>3−</sup> so as to convert the perovskite oxide BaTiO<sub>3 </sub>into the oxynitride perovskites, such as BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N or BaNbO<sub>2</sub>N, in addition to LaTaON<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The incorporation of N<sup>3−</sup>/N<sup>2−</sup> into oxygen anion sites of the perovskite oxides results in pronounced structural effects, such as an elongated Ti(Zr)—N bond length and the reduced electronegativity of the nitride ion N<sup>3−</sup>, with respect to the oxide ion O<sup>2−</sup>, which will tend to increase the covalence of the cation-anion bonds. The increased covalence of the bonding can in turn increase the likelihood of cation displacements through a second order Jahn-Teller-like distortion of the d<sup>0 </sup>cation and could influence the ferroelectric properties of the oxynitride perovskites by suppressing the formation of a ferroelectric phase and enhancing the paraelectric properties into a superparaelectric state. Even the oxynitride formation could be associated with a structural change from cubic symmetry (Pm3m) to non-cubic (e.g., tetragonal) or quasi-cubic with increased in the tetragonal distortion (c/a ratio). On the other hand, the mixed occupancy of the anion site in oxynitrides AB(O<sub>1−x</sub>N<sub>x</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, provides a condition similar to that found in relaxors, as the polarizing octahedral cations (Ti<sup>4+</sup>) will experience random chemical environments in the absence of complete O/N sites ordering. Anion control has previously been utilized to tune the properties of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic perovskite or double perovskite materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Most recently both N<sub>2 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>containing plasmas have been used for the nitridation of cubic perovskite single crystals, bulk ceramic, and thin film samples, such as SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, and for PLD and RF-sputtered depositions of BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1</sub>, as well as growth of LaTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>epitaxial thin films on SrTiO<sub>3 </sub>or MgO substrates from oxynitride targets. However, there have been no reports of deposition and characterization of oxynitride polycrystalline ABO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>or ABO<sub>3-γ</sub>N<sub>γ</sub> thin films grown on Pt electrodes on common large size commercially available substrates nor any C-V or I-V characteristics of any ferroelectric oxynitride perovskite, except for the dielectric constants of LaTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>and BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>thin films at zero dc bias. In addition, even epitaxially grown BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N films at 760° C. from a oxynitride target on a SrTiO<sub>3</sub>:Nb substrate with a SrRuO<sub>3 </sub>buffer by PLD method with gas ratio of N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>of 20:1 had a dielectric constant of only 220, which is about 20 less than that of BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N bulk samples. Temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) of BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N films from 10K to 300K is in the range of −50 ppm/K to 100 ppm/K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">For the case of RF sputter-deposited LaTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1</sub>, the dielectric constant had been reported to be from 400 to 1100 without any bulk ceramic data shown for comparison and without any voltage tunability or TCC data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">It had been previously observed that that the presence of N<sub>2 </sub>in the plasma reduces the surface defects on the electrodes as well as reducing the leakage current with almost no noticeable enhancement of the dielectric constant in SrTiO<sub>3 </sub>films for low deposition temperatures (200° C.). The observed lower leakage (higher insulation resistance) in N-doped SrTiO<sub>3 </sub>films had been attributed to nitrogen substitution of the oxygen vacancies generated by the high deposition rate of the SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, and N compensation of the donor sites created by the oxygen vacancies, without any further evidence or actual mechanism causing the lower leakage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">All of the commonly known deposition methods of BST films, and particular solutions for achieving high voltage tunability and/or high capacitance density required for achieving better performance variable capacitors and/or high density decoupling thin film capacitors, typically require using very high deposition temperatures of about 800° C. or higher, very high post-deposition annealing temperatures between 800° C. and 900° C., and thicker BST dielectric layers, typically between 200 nm and 600 nm, all of which make it very difficult to simultaneously achieve large volume manufacturing reproducible quality paraelectric thin films with reasonably high tunability ratios, i.e., tunability ratios of at least 4-6:1, under applied DC biases below 6-8 Volts, low dielectric loss, i.e., of less than 1% at 1 KHz or 1 GHz, which is typically only possible at lower deposition temperatures of about 600° C. to about 650° C. The deposition of oxynitride perovskite thin films requires using epitaxially matching substrates which are not available in large manufacturing sizes and typically obtained oxynitride perovskite materials are not stable above 600° C. if annealed in oxygen atmospheres.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">To overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a novel oxynitride paraelectric nanocomposite material which exhibits no measurable ferroelectricity and has good voltage tunable properties as well as a high dielectric constant, and also provide a method of producing of oxynitride paraelectric nanocomposite material that is compatible with large volume manufacturing processes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an RF sputter deposition process preferably provides a dense crystalline composite paraelectric material that includes nano-regions containing rich N<sup>3−</sup> anions dispersed in a nano-grain sized matrix of crystalline oxide perovskite material, wherein (ABO<sub>3−δ</sub>)<sub>α</sub>-(ABP<sub>3−δ−γ</sub>N<sub>γ</sub>)<sub>1−α</sub> (0.01&lt;γ&lt;1.5) or (Ba<sub>1−x</sub>, Sr<sub>x</sub>)TiO<sub>3−δ</sub>)<sub>α</sub>—(Ba<sub>1−x</sub>, Sr<sub>x</sub>)TiO<sub>3−δ−γ</sub>N<sub>γ</sub>)<sub>1−α</sub> or BSTON-BSTO (0.5&lt;1−x&lt;0.8) nanocomposite films, which can be utilized as a dielectric layer, for example, in voltage tunable capacitors, high density capacitance devices, such as de-coupling thin film capacitors, or monolithically integrated with other micro-electronic or passive devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of depositing a perovskite or ceramic oxide layer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention preferably includes placing a substrate in a PVD reactor; flowing a gaseous mixture, for example, argon, nitrogen and oxygen, through the reactor; maintaining the sputtering gas mixture under a constant pressure using an automatic pressure control (APC) valve, and applying RF power to a target or applying different RF power levels to multiple targets simultaneously; wherein each target material includes a perovskite-type multicomponent ceramic oxide material, single metal oxides, or single metal nitrides, such as BST, TiN, and GdTiO<sub>x </sub>positioned with an approximately 45 degree off-axis configuration relative to the substrate.</div>

The resulting nanocomposite oxynitride films have much higher breakdown voltages, typically greater than 32 Volts for 10 nm-150 nm thick films, with uniform dielectric constant and voltage tunability, and low temperature coefficients of capacitance and tunability.</div>

The annealing temperature may preferably be as low as about 450° C. and as high as about 700° C. depending on the thermal stresses that are induced by the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the dielectric perovskite layer and the substrate during the deposition and during the post-deposition anneal to guarantee lower dielectric loss factor (tan δ). The perovskite nanocomposite oxynitride films may preferably be doped with either transition metal dopants, for example, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, scandium; lanthanides including the rare earth ions, such as gadolinium, for example; and/or other amphoteric elements, such as Ge, Sn, for example.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The inventors the present invention observed that an increase in the lattice parameter or lattice volume with an N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>gas flow ratio may be a result of the lattice strain due to defects in the film, bottom layer(s) misfit strain, film stress (ion bombardment or gas incorporation in to the film), and/or a change in the lattice induced by a change of the Ti—N bond length during the partial substation of O—Ti—O with O—Ti—N incorporated into the BSTON-BSTO nanocomposite crystalline layer. In this regard, by using density functional theory (DFT) generalized gradient approximation (GGA), it had been estimated that the ideal tetragonal lattice volumes from which to extract the quasi-cubic lattices for Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>, Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>2.5</sub>N<sub>0.2 </sub>and BaSrTiO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1</sub>, as summarized in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which show that with an increase of the N amount into the Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>, the quasi-cubic lattice parameter a<sub>c </sub>will increase monotonically with the increase of the N/O ratio of the ABO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y </sub>lattice from about 3.964 to about 4.070 for nitrogen concentrations from about 0 to about 0.081, which also correlates with an increase of the tetragonality ratio c/a from about 1.0045 to about 1.058, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Experimentally observed c/a for the BSTON-BSTO main dielectric layer (1−x(Ba)=0.7) is not significantly different (about 1.025 to about 1.03) for the average nitrogen concentration (estimated from XPS N 1s peak) of about 0.024.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The observed enlargement of the unit-cell volume for the BSTO films sputtered with approximately 25%-50% N<sub>2 </sub>in the plasma while maintaining the oxygen partial pressure almost constant between about 0.5% and about 0.8% showed some tendency which is very consistent in comparison to the theoretical modeling, and that alone cannot be associated with the commonly observed phenomena for conventionally sputtered BSTO films while the oxygen partial pressure is reduced by orders to be able produce such lattice expansion phenomenon. Some type of chemical interaction of N occurs within the BSTO lattice, and it is actually incorporated into the BSTO lattice or localized areas, since under the same N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>ratio of about 40 to about 58 at deposition temperatures of less than about 600° C., the BSTO lattice is still somehow expanded, but the tetragonality ratio is not significantly deviated from the bulk level of about 1.006. The lower tetragonality ratio also correlates with non-enhancement of the dielectric constant of the BSTO which is the case for BSTO that is deposited at about 550° C. For temperatures greater than about 600° C., higher N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>ratios lead not only to lattice volume enlargement, but also to a significant increase of the tetragonality ratio up to about 1.025.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Usually thicker (about 300 nm to about 800 nm) sputtered conventional BSTO films tend to have larger tetragonality, e.g., about 1.012, for example, but that is not the case for thinner (about 100 nm to about 150 nm) conventionally sputtered BSTO films. Therefore, the observed large tetragonality of BSTON-BSTO nancomposite films as high as about 1.030 on Pt/TiOx/sapphire substrates most definitely originates from the chemical incorporation of N into some of the Ti—O bonds of the BSTO lattice.</div>

That XPS N1 1 s peak is very different from the physically adsorbed N 1 s peak which has a very different bonding energy of about 404.3 eV (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the positions for the oxide cubic perovskite region and for the displacement positions of Ti and O(N) atoms of the oxynitride perovskite nano-region have different contrasts for the very high resolution STEM images. The BSTO and BSTON lattice differences can be clearly observed from their different displacement positions as shown in 1D real space along a single line analyzed and plotted as intensity obtained from the inverse Fourier transformed image of the ABF-STEM image taken from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. It can be clearly seen that on the right side (N-rich “dark” region“) have Ti—O(N) positions (bond lengths) which are elongated as compared to the left side Ti—O positions which are expected to originate primarily from the typically shorter Ti—O bond lengths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Immediately after deposition of the top electrode layer and the formation of a shadow mask dot structure or after ion milling of the top electrode, the C—V characteristics of the BSTON-BSTO nancomposite films can be directly evaluated. This is because the top Pt electrode deposition at about 100° C. to about 300° C. does not seem to cause any observable damage near the top BST interface. There are a few factors contributing to this. First, the sputtered perovskite films are much denser than films that are deposited using chemical solution decomposition (CSD). Second, the effective use of very low O<sub>2 </sub>partial pressures to form the top BST buffer layer, the low surface roughness of the top layer of the BST film, and the use of moderate temperatures for the top Pt electrode deposition, all lead to a significantly reduced degree of damage to the BST interface with the top Pt electrode interface area. The sputtered BSTO buffer is arranged to cover the main BSTON-BSTO nancomposite layer. As-deposited BSTON-BSTO films enabled direct evaluation of insulation resistance, dielectric loss, and C-V asymmetry, while for conventionally sputtered BST samples, their C-V remained very unstable under high positive DC biases as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> even when the same top buffer layer had been applied for the BSTO films and for all BSTON films. BSTON-BSTO nancomposite films remained very stable under higher DC bias voltages, e.g., from about −12.5V to about +11V as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, and with extremely low leakage. Pt/BSTON-BSTO/Pt MIM capacitor structures also are very symmetrical and have low frequency dispersion of C-V curves from about 1 KHz to about 500 KHz. The dielectric loss factor is somehow greater for N-doped BSTON-BSTO films as compared to the BST samples with the same partial pressure control samples of about 0.5%-0.75%02: typically in the range of about 0.025 at about 1 KHz as compared to about 0.01 for the undoped BST films (both as-deposited without any post-anneals).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The observed dielectric constants in the range of about 800 to about 1100 from BSTON-BSTO nancomposite films according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention as compared to about 400 to about 500 for the conventional BSTO films show a similar trend of enhancement of their voltage tunabilities from about 2.1:1 to about 5.7-6.0:1 times under the same electric fields of about 500 kV/cm as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Particular attention should be paid about the synergy of co-interactions of multiple dopants applied together with the anion doping. For this particular preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the inventors of the present invention perform co-sputtering from Ba<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>TiO<sub>3 </sub>and Gd<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>targets simultaneously with different RF power ratios to enable formation of BSTON-BSTO-GZO solid solution nancomposite films under Ar+O<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>2 </sub>atmospheres which induce even further additional tetragonal distortion of the BSTO lattice as compared to pure BSTON-BSTO films, the BSTON-BSTO-GZO films have higher insulation resistance than the BSTON films and also have higher voltage tunabilities of greater than about 6.5:1 at about 6.5 Volts as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-29</figref>. The explanation for such additional enhancement of the voltage tunability is likely associated with the fact that a GdZrO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>oxynitride perovskite compound, as theoretically predicted, has one of the largest tetragonality ratios on the order of about 1.35 among other ABO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>1 </sub>class compounds as compared to about 2.33 for the BSTON.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">(Gd, Zr, N) triple doped BSTO films according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention are shown to have enhanced tetragonality ratios and lattice volumes as compared to BSTO or BSTON-BSTO films. An additional important finding is that, for the first time, there is suppression of a direct correlation dependence between the tunability and dielectric constant for (Gd, Zr) co-doped BSTON film when the N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>ratio is greater than about 40 as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Another important performance of the shadow mask BSTON-BSTO highly tunable thin film capacitors according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is their polarization hysteresis loop vs. applied Electric field (P-E) characteristics. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, the P-E curves of Pt/BSTO/Pt/TiO<sub>x</sub>/Sapphire and Pt/BSTON-BSTO/Pt/TiO<sub>x</sub>/Sapphire capacitor samples are shown. Typical behavior originating from the superparaelectric state of the BSTON-BSTO films at room temperature is similar to that of SrTiO<sub>3 </sub>bulk and thin film samples measured below about 100K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, BSTON-BSTO nanocomposite films according to various preferred embodiments of the present invention have very high breakdown voltages in the range of about 32 Volts. Such high breakdown voltages were observed for the first time for BSTON-BSTO films samples having high dielectric constant of greater than about 1000 with the thickness from about 90 nm to about 150 nm. Based on the commonly reported data, sputtered undoped Ba<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>TiO<sub>3 </sub>samples with dielectric constant of about 700 to about 8000 and similar thicknesses only have breakdown voltages of about 20 to about 22 Volts. The leakage current of BSTON-BSTO films capacitors is also very low at about 200 kV/cm electric field or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The normalized 5V DC bias tunability vs. temperature curves for the BSTON-BST) film capacitor is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the voltage tunability has very little temperature dependence from about −55° C. to about 105° C. in the range of only about +6% to about −8%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Some benefits and advantages of the perovskite structure nonlinear dielectric thin film capacitor (varactor) having a high voltage tunability at lower DC bias voltages and the method of manufacturing the same according to preferred embodiments of the present invention include the capability to combine multiple technologies, such as physical vapor deposition, co-sputtering to form multiple cathodes ensuring a high deposition rate and a high throughput suitable for high volume manufacturing; deposition of perovskite films with very low oxygen pressures which enables the use of low cost and high conductivity electrode materials; controlling the lattice parameters of materials with the perovskite structure which enables tuning of their voltage dependences of their dielectric constant at low electric fields; maintaining low dielectric loss, low leakage currents at operation voltages, and high breakdown strengths of the N-doped or oxynitride perovskites; maintaining low temperature dependence of zero bias dielectric constant as well as low temperature dependence of voltage tunabilities; and concurrent monolithic integration with high precision capacitor, resistor, and inductor networks capable of providing low loss high performance at high frequencies in tunable circuits, such as tunable band-pass filters, antenna matching, phase shifters, and other suitable circuits, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">A method of fabricating a perovskite dielectric thin film capacitor (varactor) according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention preferably includes two generalized steps: (1) forming a highly tunable device structure with appropriate electrodes on top of a substrate; and (2) integrating the highly tunable device structure with other thin film devices, such as, for example, SAW duplexers, RF-MEMS based switches, piezoelectrically actuated MEMS air gap varactors, fixed (low tunability) high density thin film capacitors, TFBAR circuits, resistors, inductors, and oxide based TFT and/or sensors, for example. Other thin film devices, such as well known passive components, for example, can also be used and the above specific examples are non-limiting.</div>
