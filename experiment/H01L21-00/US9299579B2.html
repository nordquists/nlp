<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-029611 filed on Feb. 19, 2014, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments described herein pertain generally to an etching method and a plasma processing apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In manufacturing semiconductor devices, contact holes may be formed in a silicon oxide film. Further, as the semiconductor devices have been miniaturized, a SAC (Self-Aligned Contact) technique has been used to form the contact holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The SAC technique is to form contact holes in a silicon oxide film provided between, for example, two gates. To be specific, a silicon nitride film covering two gates is formed between the gates and a silicon oxide film. Since the silicon nitride film serves as an etching stop layer, a contact hole is formed in a self-aligned manner in the silicon oxide film provided in a region between the two gates. In such a SAC technique, generally, plasma of a fluorocarbon gas is used for etching the silicon oxide film, as described in Patent Document 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2000-307001</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In manufacturing semiconductor devices by using the above-described SAC technique, a region formed of silicon oxide may be selectively etched with respect to a region formed of silicon nitride. However, not only the region formed of silicon oxide but also the region formed of silicon nitride is etched by plasma of a fluorocarbon gas. By way of example, in the conventional SAC technique, when a silicon nitride film is exposed by etching a silicon oxide film, the silicon nitride film may also be etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, in selectively etching the region formed of silicon oxide, it becomes necessary to suppress the region formed of silicon nitride from being etched.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example embodiment, an etching method of selectively etching a first region formed of silicon oxide with respect to a second region formed of silicon nitride includes: a protective film forming process (hereinafter, referred to as “process (a)”) of forming a protective film such that a thickness of the protective film on the second region is larger than a thickness of the protective film formed on the first region by exposing a target object including the first region and the second region to plasma of a fluorocarbon gas; and a first region etching process (hereinafter, referred to as “process (b)”) of etching the first region by exposing the target object to plasma of a fluorocarbon gas. In this method, a high frequency bias power supplied to a mounting table configured to mount the target object thereon in the process (a) is set to be lower than a high frequency bias power supplied to the mounting table in the process (b). By way of example, in the process (a), the high frequency bias power may not be supplied to the mounting table. Further, in the process (a) of this method, a temperature of the target object is set to 60° C. or more to 250° C. or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In a temperature range of 60° C. or more to 250° C. or less, a thickness of a fluorocarbon-based protective film formed on the second region is greater than a thickness of the protective film formed on the first region. Further, while a relatively low bias power is supplied, an etching rate in the second region is decreased. Therefore, according to the above-described method, a thick protective film can be formed on the second region in the process (a). Thus, when the first region is selectively etched in the process (b), it is possible to suppress the second region from being etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In the example embodiment, the second region may be buried in the first region. The etching method may further include: a modified region forming process (hereinafter, referred to as “process (c)”) of modifying the first region into a modified region by generating plasma of a gas containing hydrogen, nitrogen, and fluorine; and a modified region removing process (hereinafter, referred to as “process (d)”) of removing the modified region. In the etching method, the process (a) and the process (b) may be performed after the second region is exposed through the process (c) and the process (d). In this example embodiment, the silicon oxide in the first region is modified into ammonium fluorosilicate through the process (c) and the process (d), and the modified region formed of the ammonium fluorosilicate is removed by the process (d). The process (c) and the process (d) are selectively performed on the first region, so that it is possible to expose the second region while suppressing the second region from being damaged. The process (a) and the process (b) are performed after the process (c) and the process (d). Thus, even after the second region is exposed, it is possible to etch the first region while suppressing the second region from being damaged. Further, in the process (d), the target object may be heated, or the target object may be exposed to plasma of an inert gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the example embodiment, a gas containing at least one of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>6 </sub>may be used as the fluorocarbon gas. Further, in the example embodiment, the process (a) and the process (b) may be alternately performed.</div>

The gas supplied to the shower head <b>38</b> is introduced to the processing space S via the buffer room <b>42</b> <i>a </i>and the gas discharge holes <b>40</b> <i>h</i>. Therefore, the gas supply unit <b>44</b> and the shower head <b>38</b> constitute a gas supply unit in accordance with the example embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example embodiment, there is provided a magnetic field generating unit <b>48</b> annularly or concentrically extended at a ceiling portion of the processing chamber <b>12</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example embodiment, the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b> further includes a control unit <b>66</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Hereinafter, processes of the method MT and various controls by the control unit <b>66</b> will be described in detail. Hereinafter, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be referred to again. Further, in the following description, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> will be referred to. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> are cross-sectional views respectively illustrating target objects after performing respective processes of the etching method in accordance with the example embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the method MT starts from a process ST<b>1</b> (Form modified region). In the process ST<b>1</b>, a modified (reformed) region is formed by modifying (reforming) the first region <b>106</b>. To be specific, in the process ST<b>1</b>, the wafer W is exposed to plasma of a gas containing hydrogen, nitrogen, and fluorine. The gas used in the process ST<b>1</b> is the above-described first gas and may be a mixture of, for example, a H<sub>2 </sub>gas, a N<sub>2 </sub>gas, and a NF<sub>3 </sub>gas. Further, the first gas may contain a rare gas such as an Ar gas. When the wafer W is exposed to the plasma of the first gas, silicon oxide contained in the first region <b>106</b> is modified into ammonium fluorosilicate. Thus, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, at least a part of the first region <b>106</b> is modified into a modified region <b>106</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">When the process ST<b>1</b> is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> performs a first control. To be specific, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the gas supply unit <b>44</b> to supply the first gas. Further, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to supply the high frequency power to the shower head <b>38</b> in order to excite the first gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In the process ST<b>1</b>, a pressure within the processing chamber <b>12</b> is set to, for example, 400 mTorr to 600 mTorr (53.33 Pa to 79.99 Pa). Further, the high frequency power supplied from the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> is set to, for example, 800 W to 1200 W. Further, in the process ST<b>1</b>, the high frequency bias power may not be supplied from the high frequency power supply <b>32</b>. Furthermore, partial pressures of a NF<sub>3 </sub>gas and a H<sub>2 </sub>gas in the first gas are controlled to be in a range of 1:2 to 1:10, for example, 1:2.5. Moreover, a temperature of the wafer W is controlled to 40° C. or less, for example, 0° C. To this end, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the temperature control unit of the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b> to adjust the temperature of the mounting table <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, in the method MT, a process ST<b>2</b> (Remove modified region) is performed. In the process ST<b>2</b>, the modified region <b>106</b> <i>a </i>is removed. In the example embodiment, the wafer W is heated in the process ST<b>2</b>. In another example embodiment, the wafer W may be exposed to plasma of an inert gas in the process ST<b>2</b>. Through the process ST<b>2</b>, the modified region <b>106</b> <i>a </i>is removed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">When the process ST<b>2</b> is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> performs a second control. In the example embodiment, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the temperature control unit of the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b> to adjust the temperature of the mounting table <b>14</b>. Thus, the wafer W is heated. By way of example, the wafer W is heated to, for example, 60° C. to 250° C. Further, in this example embodiment, through the second control, an inert gas such as a N<sub>2 </sub>gas may be supplied into the processing chamber <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In another example of the second control, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the gas supply unit <b>44</b> to supply the inert gas. Further, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to supply the high frequency power to the shower head <b>38</b> in order to excite the inert gas. Furthermore, the control unit <b>66</b> may control the high frequency power supply <b>32</b> to supply the high frequency bias power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> are alternately performed a preset number of times (for example, 10 times) until the second region <b>104</b> is exposed. In a process ST<b>3</b> (Stop condition is satisfied?) of the method MT, it is determined whether or not the number of times of performing the process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> satisfies a stop condition, i.e., a condition of exceeding a certain number of times. If the stop condition is not satisfied, the process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> are repeated again. On the other hand, if the stop condition is satisfied, the process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> are ended. As described above, since the process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> are alternately performed a preset number of times, the first region <b>106</b> is partially removed as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, so that the second region <b>104</b> is exposed. Further, the process ST<b>1</b> and the process ST<b>2</b> are selectively performed with respect to the first region <b>106</b>. As a result, even after the second region <b>104</b> is exposed, it is possible to suppress the second region <b>104</b> from being damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, in the method MT, a process ST<b>4</b> (Form protective film) is performed. In the process ST<b>4</b>, a protective film is formed on the second region <b>104</b> and the first region <b>106</b>. In the process ST<b>4</b>, the protective films is formed such that a thickness of the protective film formed on the second region <b>104</b> can be greater than a thickness of the protective film formed on the first region <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">To be specific, in the process ST<b>4</b>, the wafer W is exposed to plasma of a fluorocarbon gas, i.e., the second gas containing fluorocarbon. In the process ST<b>4</b>, the high frequency bias power supplied to the base member <b>16</b> of the mounting table <b>14</b> is controlled to be lower than the high frequency bias power to be supplied to the base member <b>16</b> in a process ST<b>5</b> (Etch first region) to be described below. By way of example, in the process ST<b>4</b>, the high frequency bias power may not be supplied to the base member <b>16</b>. Thus, an etching rate of the second region <b>104</b> is decreased, so that the second region <b>104</b> is substantially not etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, in the process ST<b>4</b>, the temperature of the wafer W is set to 60° C. or more to 250° C. or less. Thus, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a fluorocarbon-based protective film PF is formed on the second region <b>104</b> and the first region <b>106</b>, and a thickness of the protective film PF on the first region <b>106</b> is greater than a thickness of the protective film PF on the second region <b>106</b>. In a temperature range of more than 250° C., the temperature becomes a glass transition temperature of the mask <b>108</b>, and a difference between the thickness of the protective film formed on the first region <b>106</b> and the thickness of the protective film formed on the second region <b>104</b> is decreased. Further, at a temperature of less than 60° C., a difference between the thickness of the protective film formed on the first region <b>106</b> and the thickness of the protective film formed on the second region <b>104</b> is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">When the process ST<b>4</b> is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> performs a third control. To be specific, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the gas supply unit <b>44</b> to supply the second gas. Further, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to supply the high frequency power to the shower head <b>38</b>. Furthermore, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>32</b> to set the high frequency bias power to be low, for example, not to supply the high frequency bias power. Moreover, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the temperature control unit of the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b> to adjust the temperature of the mounting table <b>14</b>. Thus, the temperature of the wafer W can be controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">By way of example, in the process ST<b>4</b>, a pressure within the processing chamber <b>12</b> is set to 10 mTorr to 30 mTorr (1.333 Pa to 4 Pa). Further, in the process ST<b>4</b>, a high frequency power of 500 W to 2000 W with 60 MHz is supplied from the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to the shower head <b>38</b>. Furthermore, flow rates of a C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6 </sub>gas, an Ar gas, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas contained in the second gas are set to 15 sccm to 25 sccm, 500 sccm to 600 sccm, and 10 sccm to 20 sccm, respectively. Moreover, a processing time of the process ST<b>4</b> is set to 10 seconds to 20 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, in the method MT, the process ST<b>5</b> is performed. In the process ST<b>5</b>, the first region <b>106</b> is etched. In the present example embodiment, the first region <b>106</b> between the adjacent protruding regions <b>102</b> is etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">To be specific, in the process ST<b>5</b>, the wafer W is exposed to plasma of a fluorocarbon gas, i.e., the third gas containing fluorocarbon. In the process ST<b>5</b>, a relatively high frequency bias power is supplied to the base member <b>16</b> of the mounting table <b>14</b>. Thus, the first region <b>106</b> on which a relatively thin protective film PF is formed is etched as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">When the process ST<b>5</b> is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> performs a fourth control.

Further, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to supply the high frequency power to the shower head <b>38</b>. Furthermore, the control unit <b>66</b> controls the high frequency power supply <b>32</b> to supply the high frequency bias power to the base member <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">By way of example, in the process ST<b>5</b>, a pressure within the processing chamber <b>12</b> is set to 10 mTorr to 30 mTorr (1.333 Pa to 4 Pa). Further, in the process ST<b>5</b>, a high frequency power of 500 W to 2000 W with a frequency of 60 MHz is supplied from the high frequency power supply <b>35</b> to the shower head <b>38</b>. Furthermore, in the process ST<b>5</b>, a high frequency bias power of 1000 W to 2000 W is supplied from the high frequency power supply <b>32</b> to the base member <b>16</b>. Moreover, flow rates of a C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6 </sub>gas, an Ar gas, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas contained in the third gas are set to 15 sccm to 25 sccm, 500 sccm to 600 sccm, and 10 sccm to 20 sccm, respectively. Further, a processing time of the process ST<b>5</b> is set to 10 seconds to 30 seconds. Furthermore, the temperature of the wafer W in the process ST<b>5</b> may be equal to or lower than the temperature of the wafer W in the process ST<b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In the method MT, the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are alternately performed a preset number of times. In a process ST<b>6</b> (Stop condition is satisfied?) of the method MT, it is determined whether or not the number of times of performing the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> satisfies a stop condition, i.e., a condition of exceeding a certain number of times. If the stop condition is not satisfied, the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are repeated again. On the other hand, if the stop condition is satisfied, the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are ended. As described above, since the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are alternately performed the preset number of times, the first region <b>106</b> between the adjacent protruding regions <b>102</b> is etched to a certain depth as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Further, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the first region <b>106</b> is not etched down to the underlying layer <b>100</b>, but the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> may be performed until the first region <b>106</b> is etched down to the underlying layer <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">By performing the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b>, it is possible to etch the first region <b>106</b> while suppressing the second region <b>104</b>, on which a protective film is not formed right after being exposed, from being etched. When the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are performed a preset number of times, the protective film PF is maintained on the second region <b>104</b>. Further, in performing the etching process with a fluorocarbon-containing gas, the protective film is formed on the first region <b>106</b> at the same time of etching the first region <b>106</b>. Therefore, after the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> are performed the preset number of times, the first region <b>106</b> may be etched in the same manner as performed in the process ST<b>5</b>. Thus, an etching rate of the first region <b>106</b> can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">To be specific, the method MT includes a process ST<b>7</b> (Etch first region). In the process ST<b>7</b>, the first region <b>106</b> between the adjacent protruding regions <b>102</b> is etched under the same conditions as those of the process ST<b>5</b>. When the process ST<b>7</b> is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> may perform the same control as the fourth control. If the process ST<b>7</b> is performed, in the wafer W, a hole extended to the underlying layer <b>100</b> is formed as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. However, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, at an edge portion surrounded by the underlying layer <b>100</b> and the second region <b>104</b>, a residue <b>106</b> <i>b </i>formed of silicon oxide may remain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In the method MT, in order to remove the residue <b>106</b> <i>b</i>, a process ST<b>8</b> (Form modified region) and a process ST<b>9</b> (Remove modified region) may be further performed. The process ST<b>8</b> is the same as the process ST<b>1</b>, and the process ST<b>9</b> is the same as the process ST<b>2</b>. Further, when the process ST<b>8</b> and the process ST<b>9</b> are performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>66</b> may perform the first control and the second control, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In the process ST<b>8</b> of the method MT, a modified region <b>106</b> <i>c </i>may be formed by modifying the residue <b>106</b> <i>b </i>as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Further, the modified region <b>106</b> <i>c </i>may be removed in the process ST<b>9</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. The process ST<b>8</b> and the process ST<b>9</b> may be alternately repeated a multiple number of times. Thus, according to the method MT, a hole HL can be formed between the adjacent protruding regions <b>102</b> in a self-aligned manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Several example embodiments have been described above, but various modifications can be made without being limited to the above-described example embodiments. By way of example, in the above-described example embodiments, all the processes of the method MT are performed in the single plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b>, but a different apparatus may be used for each process or several processes. Further, although the plasma processing apparatus <b>10</b> is configured as a capacitively coupled plasma processing apparatus, a different type of plasma processing apparatus may be used. Various plasma processing apparatuses, e.g., an inductively coupled plasma processing apparatus and a plasma processing apparatus using a plasma source such as a microwave may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the process ST<b>1</b>, the process ST<b>2</b>, the process ST<b>7</b>, the process ST<b>8</b>, and the process ST<b>9</b> of the method MT are optional processes for forming the hole HL in the wafer W depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Therefore, these processes may be unnecessary depending on a wafer. By way of example, if the wafer includes a first region formed of silicon oxide and a second region formed of silicon nitride and the first region and the second region are exposed, a method including the process ST<b>4</b> and the process ST<b>5</b> can be performed in order to selectively etch the first region.</div>
