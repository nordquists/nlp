<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a field facet mirror for an illumination optics of a projection exposure apparatus for EUV microlithography. The disclosure also relates to a method for producing a field facet mirror of this type, an illumination optics with a field facet mirror of this type, an illumination system with an illumination optics of this type, a projection exposure apparatus with an illumination system of this type, a method for producing a microstructured or nanostructured component using a projection exposure apparatus of this type, and a component which is microstructured or nanostructured and produced according to a production method of this type.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A field facet mirror for use in an illumination optics of a projection exposure apparatus for EUV microlithography is known from WO 2007/128407A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, field facet mirrors of this type should, on the one hand, provide uniform illumination of the object field and, on the other hand, guide as large a faction as possible of the illumination light produced by an EUV light source to the object field. In this case, the facets of the field facet mirror receive a shape and an aspect ratio, which are adapted to the object field to be illuminated. There is still a desire for improvement in the known field facet mirrors in relation to the simultaneous ensuring of a uniform object field illumination, in particular when the illumination light provided by the EUV light source does not have a uniform intensity distribution over the illumination bundle, and a high EUV throughput.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure provides a field facet mirror for use in an illumination optics of a projection exposure apparatus for EUV microlithography that can ensure a uniform object field illumination with a simultaneously high EUV throughput.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure discusses giving up the previously maintained boundary condition, according to which the projection of field facet edges in the direction of a normal of a support plate generally present of the known field facet mirrors is identical, and specifically identical both in relation to the size and also the shape and also in relation to the orientation. Owing to the new degree of freedom of permitting non-identically formed projections, a pre-compensation, for example, of a possible rotation of the images, because of the imaging conditions, of individual field facets relative to one another can be achieved during their superimposition on the object field. A rotation of this type of the facet images results, as is recognised according to the disclosure, because of various paths of the illumination light guided channel-wise via the field facets through the illumination optical system. A variation in the imaging scale of the field facets on the object field may also occur here. By giving up the condition of identical projections of the field facet reflection surfaces onto the base plane, this variation of the imaging scale may also be pre-compensated. During the imaging onto the object field, the rotation of the facet images without pre-compensation leads to the undesired effect of edge scattering of the object field illumination as the images of the field facets superimposed on the object field no longer match the different real facet faces, in particular at the edge. The base plane of the field facet mirror, which is spanned by the field facets arranged next to one another, is generally predetermined by a holding plane of a field facet support. This base plane generally coincides with a main reflection plane of the field facet mirror, relative to which the field facets can still be arranged tilted individually for the allocation of illumination channels of the illumination optical system. The main reflection plane is in this case the reflection plane with untilted field facets (field facets aligned with the holding plane).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The field facets may be arranged next to one another on a support plate. This support plate then generally runs parallel to the base plane of the field facet mirror.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">At least two of the field facets may be arranged tilted with respect to one another by more than 1° about an axis perpendicular to the base plane of the field facet mirror. The tilting relative to an untilted starting position may, for example, be in the range between −3° and 3°, in the range between −2° and 2° or in the range between −1° and 1°. This tilting at most changes the tilting position of the reflection surfaces of the field facets slightly and thus has no or slight effects on the allocation of the tilted field facet to the illumination channels of the illumination optical system. Such a tilted arrangement of the field facets represents a degree of freedom which was previously rejected because of assumed steric accommodation problems of the field facets and which helps to reduce or even completely avoid an edge scattering of the object field illumination observed in the previously known occupation geometries of field facets on the field facet mirror. The degree of freedom according to the disclosure of the tilting of the field facets about an axis perpendicular to the base plane or to the main reflection plane facilitates a design in which tilting angles about axes, which lie in the main reflection plane and lead to too great a maladjustment between the face of the projection of the reflection surfaces of tilted field facets on the main reflection plane, on the one hand, and the real reflection face, on the other hand, are avoided. According to the disclosure, field facets with a more favourable aspect ratio in relation to their manufacturing can be used to occupy the field facet mirror, without a disruptive edge scattering in the object field illumination resulting. In addition, the degree of filling of the object field and therefore the transportable light conductance are thus effectively increased. This is important, in particular for sources with a large light conductance or for illumination systems, which offer illumination pupils which are filled to a different degree without light loss. An allocation of field facets tilted about the tilting axis perpendicular to the main reflection plane to the illumination angles predetermined by an allocation to pupil facets of a pupil facet mirror leads to the possibility of ensuring an intensity monitoring of the illumination light taking place at the edges of the object field with minimised losses. Field facets of this type may be used in a projection exposure system, within which, during a projection exposure, an object is displaced continuously or step-wise in an object displacement direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A part ring or arc shape of the field facets can allow well adapted illumination of a correspondingly part ring-shaped or arcuate object field. An object field shape of this type can be imaged well with a downstream projection optical system of the projection exposure apparatus designed as a mirror optical system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">An arrangement of the tilting axis can ensure that a tilting of the respective field facet only slightly changes the occupation requirement of this field facet in the main reflection plane, as a tilting at best leads to a slight deviation of the position of the arcuate or part ring-shaped side edges of the facet reflection face. During a tilting about this tilting axis, the end faces of the facet reflection surfaces leading or following in the peripheral direction about the partial circle or arc shape are practically exclusively displaced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Field facets can be manufactured with a lower production outlay in comparison to field facets with a small part ring thickness. This minimal part ring thickness is accompanied by a thickness, which is accordingly easier to handle for the production of the field facets, of the respect field facet base body. In addition, the relative mutual shading of the field facets with increasing width may be less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Field facets tilted about a further degree of tilting freedom can ensure a desired variability in the allocation of the field facets to pupil facets of a pupil facet mirror of an illumination optics of the EUV projection exposure system. A predetermined and well mixed allocation of pupil facets of the pupil facet mirror allocated to the field facets is possible. An axis is selected as the tilting axis for the further degree of tilting freedom, the tilting of which leads to as small a deviation as possible of a face of a field facet projected onto the main reflection plane from on the real reflection surface of the field facet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Facet base bodies limited by opposing spherical side walls may be produced precisely. “Spherical” in this context means “shaped like the section of a face of a ball”. Alternatively, the field facets may also have facet base bodies, which are limited by two cylindrical side walls which are opposing and displaced in parallel, in particular, with respect to one another. It is possible to arrange field facets of this type next to one another with small spacings, which leads to a high occupation density of the field facets within the main reflection plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">A facet shape can be well matched to an arcuate or part ring shape of an object field to be illuminated. One of the two opposing spherical side walls is convex and the other of the two spherical side walls is concave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Facets with side walls of the facet base body may, on the one hand, be closely packed and, on the other hand, allow a displacement of the two adjacent facet base bodies relative to one another along the spherical face of the two mutually facing side walls. This allows new degrees of freedom in the relative positioning of the field facets of the field facet mirror with respect to one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Field facets can be produced with one and the same processing tool for producing the spherical side walls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Facet mirrors can be packed closely, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, can be arranged closely packed between other field facets and nevertheless be tilt-adjusted about the centre.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Field facets may also be adapted to more exotic object field forms or else to other requirements, for example to control the intensity of the illumination light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A field facet mirror can allow the illumination of sensors arranged in the region of edges of the object field, so an effective monitoring of the energy or intensity of a light source, with which the facet mirror is loaded, is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Field facets which are adjacent and tilted with respect to one another can have advantages which correspond to those of a field facet mirror.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Intermediate spaces can allow an individual arrangement of the individual field facets and thus good compensation of an undesired image tilting effect in the imaging of the field facets in the object field. The field facets may be arcuate or rectangular in design. The field facets may be arranged column-wise in the base plane of the field facet mirror. Packing densities of the field facets are possible, which are greater than 50%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A field facet mirror, for which, according to the disclosure, various embodiments are given, can increase the EUV light throughput inside a projection exposure apparatus equipped with a field facet mirror of this type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">A manufacturing process can allow efficient production of field facet groups with side walls of adjacent facet base bodies, which have the same radius of curvature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">A manufacturing method can be adapted to facet block arrangements of field facet mirrors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">A manufacturing method can allow an exact orientation of the field facets assembled within a facet block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The advantages of an illumination optics can correspond to those which have already been discussed above with reference to the field facet mirror according to the disclosure. It was recognised in the illumination optics, that the departure from the adjustment specification for the transmission facet mirrors, to in each case superimpose the centres of the field facet images in the object field, can lead to further degrees of freedom with regard to the optimisation of the total superimposition of the field facet images in the object field. The adjustment of the transmission facets takes place such that the superimposition of the facet images is optimised in total over the object field. The field facets and the associated transmission facets may be static facets or else actuatable facets, in other words facets which can be displaced in a controlled manner. The field facets and/or the transmission facets may be constructed from a plurality of individual facets. These individual facets may be displaceable, in a manner which is actuatable, relative to one another. A corresponding concept with an individual facet/individual mirror structure of this type is known from DE 10 2008 009 600 A. By displacing or tilting of the field facets, the transmission facet individually associated with a respective field facet may be selected from a plurality of possible transmission facets of the transmission facet mirror. The extended region in the centre of the object field, on which the centres of the reflection surfaces of the field facets are imaged in the illumination optics according to the disclosure, may take in an area in the order of magnitude of one or more mm<sup>2</sup>. The extended region has an area, which is spanned by a dimension extending approximately tangentially to the images of the arcuate field facets and a dimension extending approximately radially to the images of the arcuate field facets. The tangential dimension may extend in the direction of a long field extent of the object field and the radial dimension may extend along a short field extent of the object field. The tangential dimension has a size, which is proportional to an arc radius of curvature of the images of the field facets and to the tangent (tan) of a tilting angle of the field facets relative to one another about an axis perpendicular to the base plane of the field facet mirror. In the case of typical tilts of this type of the field facets in the range of ±3° and an arc radius of curvature of the field facet images of 150 mm, a tangential dimension is produced of the extended region of 15 mm. The radial dimension of the extended region is proportional to a spacing of the object plane from a target superimposed plane spaced apart therefrom, of the field facet images. This target superimposition plane may coincide, for example, with a displacement plane of a correction diaphragm. A UNICOM may be arranged, for example, in the target superimposition plane. The target superimposition plane is also called below a diaphragm or stop plane of a correction diaphragm or stop. In addition, the radial dimension of the extended region is proportional to a numeric aperture of the object field illumination. Assuming typical values for the numerical aperture of the object field illumination, for example NA=0.1, and for the spacing between the object plane and the target superimposition plane, for example 10 mm a value of 1.5 mm is produced for the radial dimension of the extended region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The extended region may have an extent of between 3 mm and 25 mm, in particular between 5 mm and 20 mm, for the tangential dimension. For the radial dimension, the extended region may have an extent of between 0.5 mm and 3 mm, in particular between 0.75 mm and 2 mm. As the object plane, on the one hand, and the target superimposition plane, on the other hand, are closely adjacent to one another, it is unimportant in practice in considering the dimension above, whether the extended region is observed in the target superimposition plane or in the object plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In an illumination optics, via the orientation of the transmission facets to image the centres of the reflection surfaces of the field facets onto a region extended along the long field extent in the centre of the object field, a compensation of a tilting effect of the imaging of arcuate field facets into the object field can surprisingly be achieved. According to the disclosure, it was recognised that a tilted arc is also still very similar to the original arc if the condition is given up that all the centres of the facet arcs in the object field have to be precisely imaged on one another. With surprisingly little outlay, good compensation of a tilting imaging effect of the following optical system is produced without a relatively large intervention into the structure of a conventional field facet mirror with curved field facets being used for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">A superimposition arrangement can allow the use of a correction mechanism influencing the intensity of the object field illumination from the more sharply superimposed edge, so an undesired effect on an illumination angle distribution when using this correction mechanism is minimised. The superimposition may be optimised in the object plane or alternatively also in a displacement plane of the correction mechanism, which does not have to coincide with the object plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The advantages of an illumination system, a projection exposure apparatus, a production method, and a microstructured component can correspond to those which were already discussed above with reference to the field facet mirror according to the disclosure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The illumination light <b>3</b> emitted by the light source is firstly collected in a collector <b>4</b>.

From the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, the illumination light <b>3</b> is reflected toward a pupil facet mirror <b>7</b>. The illumination light bundle is divided into a plurality of illumination channels via the facets of the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, on the one hand, and the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> on the other hand, one pair of facets with a field facet or a pupil facet being precisely allocated to each illumination channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A following optics <b>8</b> arranged downstream of the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> guides the illumination light <b>3</b>, in other words the light of all the illumination channels, toward an object field <b>9</b>. The field facet mirror <b>6</b>, the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> and the following optics <b>8</b> are components of an illumination optics <b>10</b> for illuminating the object field <b>9</b>.

The totality of these 299 field facets <b>18</b> has a packing density of 56%. The packing density, which is also called the degree of filling, relates to the total illuminated surface of the field facet mirror <b>6</b>. The packing density is produced from the sum of the reflection surfaces <b>22</b> of the field facets <b>18</b> used for reflection divided by the area of the total and, in the present case, elliptical illumination area of the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, which is specified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> by the edging of the remote field <b>20</b>. The illumination area without the installation space <b>19</b>, in other words without shadings of the remote field <b>20</b>, which are caused by components upstream of the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, is inserted into the denominator of the packing density here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The basic structure of the field facet mirror <b>6</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> corresponds, even with regard to the arrangement of the field facets <b>18</b> in four columns S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b>, to the structure of the field facet mirror <b>6</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the field facet mirror <b>6</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, respective adjacent field facets <b>18</b> are pivoted (tilt Z) with respect to one another about a tilting axis <b>26</b> running parallel to the z-axis, which extends approximately through the centre <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the respective field facet <b>18</b>. This is described in more detail below with the aid of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and two selected field facets <b>18</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>18</b> <sub>2</sub>. The field facet <b>18</b> <sub>2 </sub>is arranged in the column S<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> directly below the field facet <b>18</b> <sub>1</sub>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Each of the reflection surfaces <b>22</b> of the arcuate field facets <b>18</b> has a long facet extent in the x-direction and a short facet extent in the y-direction. An intermediate space <b>45</b> which changes constantly and in particular strictly monotonically is produced in the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> along the long facet extent, in other words along the x-direction between the two field facets <b>18</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>18</b> <sub>2 </sub>which are tilted with respect to one another and adjacent over their long facet extent. In the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the intermediate space <b>45</b> between the two field facets <b>18</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>18</b> <sub>2 </sub>reduces from the left to the right.

The pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> is a transmission facet mirror and the pupil facets of the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> are transmission facets. This allocation is such that a tilting of the image, caused by imaging, of the respective field facet <b>18</b> in the object field <b>9</b> is just compensated because of the respective tilting angle tilt Z about the tilting axis <b>26</b>, which is defined by the respective centre <b>27</b> <i>a</i>, of the field facet <b>18</b>, so the images of the field facets <b>18</b> superimpose one another practically untilted in the object field <b>9</b> despite the tilting imaging effect of the following optics <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">A further configuration of a field facet mirror <b>6</b> with field facets <b>18</b> respectively tilted with respect to one another individually about a tilt Z is described below with the aid of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>.

The field facet mirror <b>6</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> also has 299 field facets <b>18</b>, which are individually tilted in each case about a tilt Z, to which, in accordance with the tilting effect of the imaging via illumination channels, pupil faces of the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b> of the illumination optics <b>10</b> are individually allocated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In the field facet mirror <b>6</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the packing density of the field facets <b>18</b> is 53%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">With the aid of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, further embodiment of an illumination optics <b>10</b> will be described below with a field facet mirror <b>6</b> and a transmission facet mirror in the form of a pupil facet mirror. Components, functions and production method steps, which correspond to those which were already discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 17</figref>, have the same reference numerals and will not be discussed again in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the superimposition of images of selected illumination points AP on the arcuate field facets <b>18</b> of the field facet mirror <b>6</b> in the manner of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in a diaphragm plane or target superimposition plane, which is described in more detail below, adjacent to the object field <b>9</b> and spaced apart from the object field <b>9</b>. The same grid of illumination points AP is observed on each of the field facets <b>18</b> here, specifically an 11×3 grid of three rows equally spaced apart in the y-direction each of 11 illumination points AP spaced apart in the x-direction. The spacing of the illumination points AP in the x-direction is selected such that, in the object field <b>9</b>, an equidistant grid of the images of the illumination points AP is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In the illumination optics <b>10</b>, which leads to the superimposition according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the transmission facets, in other words the pupil facets of the pupil facet mirror <b>7</b>, are oriented such that the centres <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the reflection surfaces <b>22</b> of the arcuate field facets <b>18</b> are not imaged on one point, but on an extended region <b>46</b> (cf. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The centre <b>27</b> <i>a </i>is in each case the point which is located halfway between the intersections of the respective symmetry radii with the side walls <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> of the respective reflection surface <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the extended imaging region in the centre of the object field in a greatly enlarged view. The region <b>46</b> has an extent in the x-direction of a few millimeters and an extent of less than one millimeter in the y-direction. The centre images B(<b>27</b> <i>a</i>) of the central illumination points AP are present scattered in the region <b>46</b>. This scattering is the result of a corresponding translation of the respective images of the field facets <b>18</b>, which is caused by a corresponding tilting of the pupil facets in the x- and y-direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The individual x- and y-translation by corresponding tilting adjustment of the pupil facets means that a total superimposition of all the field facets in the object field <b>9</b>, in particular at the field edges in the case of small and large x-values is significantly improved compared to an adjusting specification, in which all the centre images B(<b>27</b> <i>a</i>) are superimposed in a point in the object field <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The individual translation in the x- and y-direction, is optimised in the illumination optics <b>10</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> in such a way that the images of the reflection surfaces <b>22</b> of the field facets <b>18</b> along the lower edge <b>47</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> extending along the long field extent x, are imaged more sharply superimposing one another than along the opposing edge <b>48</b> along the long field extent, in other words along the x-axis. From the edge <b>47</b> via the use, for example, of a plurality of finger diaphragms, an illumination angle-independent intensity correction of the illumination of the object field <b>9</b> is possible in the object plane <b>11</b> or in the diaphragm plane spaced apart therefrom, for example via a UNICOM known from EP 0 952 491 A1. A diaphragm plane of a correction diaphragm may be spaced apart from the object plane <b>11</b>, as already mentioned above. In this case, the optimisation in the illumination optics <b>10</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> may take place by translation in the x- and y-direction such that the images of the reflection surfaces <b>22</b> of the field facets <b>18</b> along the edge <b>47</b> are imaged sharply superimposing one another in the image plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The illumination optics <b>10</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> therefore represents a further possibility for compensating a tilting imaging effect of the following optics <b>8</b> by a corresponding configuration of the illumination optics <b>10</b> in such a way that, in the object field <b>7</b>, good superimposition of the field facet images and therefore an optimised illumination is ensured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Owing to the arrangement variants described above of the field facets <b>18</b> of the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, a transfer of the illumination light <b>3</b> which was reflected to illuminate the object field <b>9</b> by the field facet mirror <b>6</b>, is maximised.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">To produce a microstructured or nanostructured component, the projection exposure apparatus <b>1</b> is used as follows: firstly, the reticle and the wafer are provided. A structure on the reticle is then projected onto a light-sensitive layer of the wafer with the aid of the projection exposure apparatus <b>1</b>. By developing the light-sensitive layer, a microstructure on the wafer and therefore the microstructured component, is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The projection exposure apparatus <b>1</b> is designed as a scanner. The reticle is continuously displaced here in the y-direction during the projection exposure.
