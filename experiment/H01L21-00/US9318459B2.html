<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to integrated circuit packages. In particular the present disclosure relates to integrated circuits formed in reconstituted wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Integrated circuits are used in a large variety of applications. Individual integrated circuits can take the form of voltage amplifiers, voltage regulators, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, wireless adapters, microprocessors, smart cards, and many other devices. Some integrated circuits have circuitry that performs many of these functions on a single chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuits are installed in desk top computers, lap top computers, cell phones, MP3 players, automobiles, printers, scanners, wireless routers, and in nearly every other kind of electronic device. Integrated circuits are generally packaged in such a way that they can easily be installed in one of the above mentioned devices. Methods of packaging integrated circuits include the use of ball grid arrays (BGAs), pin grid arrays (PGAs), lead frames, and many other methods. The balls, pins, and leads of the various integrated circuit packages provide the electrical connections between the integrated circuit and the electronic device in which it is installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In many devices, individually packaged integrated circuits are stacked one on top of the another. This saves surface area in the electronic device but also leads to complications in electrically connecting the integrated circuits to each other and to the electronic device. In such devices the integrated circuit packages generally have electrical connections on a top surface and a bottom surface of the package. Conductive redistribution lines are formed on both an active side and an inactive side of the integrated circuit die and connected by a through via. However, processing the redistribution lines on the inactive side of the die can damage structures on the active side of the die.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment is a method for forming a through via integrated circuit package. The method includes forming conductive through vias in the integrated circuit package to electrically connect structures on an active side of an integrated circuit die to structures on an inactive side of the integrated circuit die.

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a reconstituted wafer <b>10</b> that includes a plurality of semiconductor die <b>32</b>. The methods of making such a reconstituted wafer <b>10</b> are well known in the art and are described in U.S. patent publication numbers 2012/0171875, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,728,831; 2012/0168944, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,766,422; and 2012/0282767. The remaining figures show steps related to the invention being carried out on what will become a single package that will be formed while it is part of the reconstituted wafer <b>10</b>. The steps shown herein will usually be carried out on the wafer <b>10</b> as a whole, prior to separating into individual packages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a first step in the formation of an integrated circuit package <b>30</b> according to one embodiment. The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> includes an integrated circuit die <b>32</b> embedded in a reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>. The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> is a portion of the reconstituted wafer <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. For ease of description and figures, the remaining text and figures will show the construction of one package <b>30</b> rather than the whole wafer <b>10</b> with the understanding that the steps are being carried out on the wafer <b>10</b> as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The integrated circuit die <b>32</b> includes contact pads <b>40</b> on an active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. Through vias <b>42</b> are formed in the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>. The through vias <b>42</b> are filled with a conductive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> is, for example, a molding compound including granular silica particles. The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> laterally surrounds the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> and covers an inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. The active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>, including contact pads <b>40</b>, is not covered by the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>. The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> is, for example, 700 μm thick. The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> extends laterally from the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> allowing through vias <b>42</b> to be formed therein. Through vias <b>42</b> allow electrical connection of elements on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> to elements on the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>, which described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Forming through vias <b>42</b> in the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> has several advantages. The reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> is relatively inexpensive to manufacture compared to the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. Thus, providing a reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> with a very large surface area is relatively inexpensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In some devices, through vias are formed in the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> instead of the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The through vias <b>42</b>, whether in the die <b>32</b> or substrate <b>38</b>, are filled completely with a copper paste. Alternatively, the through vias <b>42</b> may be filled with copper formed in an electroless or electroplating process. The copper formed in electroless or electroplating process can include one or more layers including a seed layer of copper or tungsten, and an electroless layer of copper, as well an electroplated layer of copper. Any suitable materials may be used to form the conductive material filling the through via <b>42</b> as well as the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is described as having an active side and an inactive side. This refers to the fact that the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> will generally only have transistors formed on a single surface of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. The surface of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>, including the transistors, is generally referred to as the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. It is also called the front face, top face, or other terms. The surface opposite the contact pads <b>40</b> is generally called the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. It is also called the backside, bottom, or other terms. Therefore the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is corresponds to the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. The inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> corresponds to the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a passivation layer <b>44</b> is formed on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> and the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>. The passivation layer <b>44</b> is patterned to expose the contact pads <b>40</b> of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> as well as the through vias <b>42</b> of the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>. Metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> are formed on the passivation layer <b>44</b> and electrically connect the contact pads <b>40</b> to the through vias <b>42</b>. A second passivation layer <b>48</b> is formed on the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. The second passivation layer <b>48</b> is patterned to expose portions of the redistribution lines <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The passivation layer <b>44</b> is, for example, 7 μm thick. The passivation layer <b>44</b> is a spin-on dielectric material, in one embodiment. The spin-on dielectric <b>44</b> is placed on the surface of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> and the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> in liquid form. The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is then subject to a spin-on process in which the integrated circuit <b>30</b> is rotated at very high RPS. This causes the dielectric <b>44</b>, in liquid form still, to spread out and to achieve substantially uniform thickness over the integrated circuit package <b>32</b>. The passivation layer <b>44</b> is then cured to harden the passivation layer <b>44</b>. In one embodiment, the passivation layer <b>44</b> is spin-on glass. Any other suitable materials may be used for the passivation layer <b>44</b> including liquid and dry films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> are formed of copper about 7 μm thick. The metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> are formed by first depositing a seed layer of copper or tungsten by a physical vapor deposition process. The physical vapor deposition process is, for example, a sputtering process. The sputtering process produces a seed layer about 200 nm thick. The seed layer of copper or tungsten is then patterned and etched. An electroplating process is then performed in which copper is electroplated on the seed layer and grown to the thickness of about 7 μm. The electroplated copper is formed on the seed layer about 7 μm thick. This produces the redistribution lines <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The redistribution lines <b>46</b> are in electrical contact with the contact pads <b>40</b> of the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. While two redistribution lines <b>46</b> and two contact pads <b>40</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, in practice there will be many more contact pads <b>40</b> on the active surface of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>, many more redistribution lines <b>46</b>, and more through vias <b>42</b> than shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The second passivation layer <b>48</b> is about 9 μm thick. The passivation layer <b>48</b> is formed in substantially the same manner as passivation layer <b>44</b>. The passivation layer <b>48</b> is patterned to expose portions of the redistribution lines <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, solder balls <b>50</b> are placed on the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. The molding compound <b>52</b> covers the second passivation layer and the solder balls <b>50</b>. Prior to putting on the solder balls <b>50</b>, solder flux (not shown) can be placed on the exposed portions of the redistribution lines <b>46</b> if needed. The solder balls <b>50</b> are placed on the solder flux on the redistribution lines <b>46</b> and then solder reflow is performed. The active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is then covered in a molding compound <b>52</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The molding compound <b>52</b> is a conventional molding compound of a type typically used to encapsulate integrated circuit packages. The molding compound <b>52</b> can be an epoxy molding compound or any other suitable molding compound. The molding compound <b>52</b> covering the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> protects the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> during subsequent processing of the inactive side of the semiconductor package <b>30</b> as described further below. When metal redistribution lines are formed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>, dielectric and metal layers will be deposited and patterned as will be described later herein. In conventional processes, during processing of the inactive side, a protective silicon substrate or other blocking substrate may be placed over the active side to protect the active side during processing of the inactive side. The acid etchants typically used to etch dielectric layers and metal layers on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can inadvertently seep between the protective silicon substrate and the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b> and into the metal layers and the dielectric layers on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. If there is not adequate protection, the chemicals used to etch on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can corrode the redistribution lines <b>46</b> and even the contact pads <b>40</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Other processes for protecting the active side during inactive side processing include, prior to attaching solder balls <b>50</b>, placing a protective polymer laminate on the active side to protect the active side while the inactive side is being processed. Such a protective polymer laminate is then removed when solder balls <b>50</b> are to be attached to the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. The removal of this protective polymer laminate may leave residues on the active side after removal, if not done properly, and this can affect reliability of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. If there are residues left on the redistribution lines <b>46</b>, it is possible that very poor electrical contact will be made by the solder balls <b>50</b> to the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. This can cause the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> to function improperly or not at all, therefore care should be taken to properly remove the residue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Using a protective molding compound <b>52</b> according to one embodiment is advantageous compared to other processes. Placing the solder balls <b>50</b> on the redistribution lines <b>46</b> and covering the solder balls <b>50</b> and the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> with the molding compound <b>52</b> during processing of the inactive side provides superior protection during inactive side processing. This obviates the need for placing a protective polymer laminate or protective silicon substrate on the active side during processing of the inactive side. The molding compound <b>52</b> does not allow chemicals used during inactive processing to seep into the metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> during inactive side processing. Furthermore, the molding compound <b>52</b> is partially removed so no damaging residues are left on the active side components. Thus, placing the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side, including on the solder balls <b>50</b>, during inactive side processing is advantageous over using either a protective polymer laminate or a protective silicon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, passivation layer <b>53</b> is formed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. The passivation layer <b>53</b> is patterned to expose through vias <b>42</b>. Inactive side metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> are formed on the exposed portions of the through vias <b>42</b> and on the passivation layer <b>53</b>. A passivation layer <b>56</b> is then formed on the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> and on the passivation layer <b>53</b>. The passivation layer <b>56</b> is patterned to expose portions of the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>. The passivation layer <b>53</b>, the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>, and the passivation layer <b>56</b> are formed of the same materials and in substantially the same manner as the passivation layers <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> and redistribution lines <b>46</b> of the active side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, a protective substrate <b>58</b> is placed on the surface of the passivation layer <b>56</b> on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. The protective substrate <b>58</b> protects components on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package during further processing of the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. The protective substrate <b>58</b> is, in one example, a protective silicon substrate as described previously. Any suitable protection can be used to protect the active side during further processing of the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, the molding compound <b>52</b> is partially removed to expose portions of the solder balls <b>50</b>. The solder balls <b>50</b> are also partially removed. The thickness of the molding compound <b>52</b> is reduced by hundreds of microns. However, a portion of the molding compound <b>52</b> still remains. In one embodiment the molding compound <b>52</b> and solder balls <b>50</b> are partially removed by grinding the molding compound <b>52</b> and solder balls <b>50</b> in grinding process. CMC may also be used. About half of each solder ball <b>50</b> is ground away in the grinding process. This exposes a maximum surface area of the solder balls <b>50</b>. During this grinding process, the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is protected by the protective layer <b>58</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, solder balls <b>60</b> are placed on the exposed portions of the solder balls <b>50</b>. Because a large portion of the solder balls <b>50</b> is exposed, solder balls <b>60</b> can be electrically connection to the solder balls <b>50</b>. The solder balls <b>50</b> are in electrical connection with the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. The redistribution lines <b>46</b> are in electrical connection with the through vias <b>42</b>. The through vias <b>42</b> are in electrical contact with inactive side metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>. Thus the inactive side redistribution lines are electrically connected to the active side solder balls <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Solder balls <b>62</b> are placed on the inactive side redistribution lines <b>54</b>. The protective silicon substrate <b>58</b> is removed from the inactive side of the integrated circuit package so that further processing of the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> has increased reliability over other integrated circuit packages which are formed by protecting the active side with a protective polymer laminate or protective silicon substrate during inactive side processing. Chemicals do not seep through the molding compound <b>52</b> and deteriorate active side structures. No protective polymer laminate is removed and therefore no harmful residues are left on structures of the active side. Thus, reliability of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is increased. The through via integrated circuit package <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> can be connected to other circuits, a circuit board, or other devices both on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> and the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. While solder balls <b>62</b> are shown as being placed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>, in other applications, the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> are exposed for connection directly to a test board. The test board includes metal connection structures which can connect to the redistribution lines <b>54</b> to test the functionality of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. The connection structures of the test board may include solder balls, pins of a pin grid array, or any other suitable electrical connections. While the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> shows solder balls <b>60</b> as being electrically connected to solder balls <b>62</b>, in practice not all solder balls <b>60</b> that are placed on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> will be electrically connected to metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> of the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. Some contact pads <b>40</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> will only be connected to solder balls <b>62</b> or electrical connections placed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. Other contact pads <b>40</b> will be connected only to solder balls <b>60</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. Many configurations of solder balls <b>60</b>, active side redistribution lines <b>46</b>, contact pads <b>40</b>, through vias <b>42</b>, inactive side redistribution lines <b>54</b>, and solder balls <b>62</b> are possible in accordance with principles of the present disclosure. All such configurations fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a semiconductor package <b>30</b> according to one embodiment. The semiconductor package <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is at the same point in processing as the semiconductor package <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. Note that in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, one of the contacts <b>40</b> is not coupled to a solder ball <b>50</b> on the active side to show how this is done in any of the embodiments. Active side metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> have already been formed, solder ball <b>50</b> has already been placed, and molding compound <b>52</b> coats the solder ball <b>50</b> and the rest of the active side.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, solder balls <b>62</b> are placed on the redistribution lines <b>54</b>. Prior to placement of the solder balls <b>62</b> on the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>, flux is placed on the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>. Solder balls <b>62</b> are then placed on the flux on the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> and reflow is performed.

The molding compound <b>64</b> is substantially identical to the molding compound <b>52</b> covering the active side. The molding compound <b>64</b> serves the same purpose as the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the molding compound <b>52</b> and the solder balls <b>50</b> are ground, as described previously. The molding compound <b>64</b> and the solder balls <b>62</b> on the inactive side have also been ground. The grinding of the molding compound <b>64</b> and the exposure of the remaining portions of solder balls <b>62</b> are done in substantially the same manner as described previously regarding the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. Because the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is covered in molding compound <b>34</b>, the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> is protected during grinding of the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>. During grinding it is possible that structures on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can be damaged in the absence of molding compound <b>64</b>. Other processes for removing a portion of the molding compound <b>52</b> and the solder balls <b>50</b> are also possible. Such processes may include polishing, CMP, chemically etching the molding compound <b>52</b> and the solder balls <b>50</b> or other suitable processes. These processes may damage the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b> on the inactive side if the inactive side is not adequately protected. Because the molding compound <b>64</b> covers the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>, the inactive side is protected from the processes performed on the active side. Likewise, the molding compound <b>52</b> protects the active side from processes performed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit package as described previously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, solder balls <b>60</b> are placed on exposed portions of solder balls <b>50</b>. Solder balls <b>66</b> are also placed on exposed portions of solder balls <b>62</b>. The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> may now be connected in any suitable system. Electrical components can be connected to solder balls <b>66</b> of the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>; other electrical devices may be connected to solder balls <b>60</b> of the integrated circuit package. Thus connections can be made on both the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> and the inactive side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, solder balls <b>66</b> are not placed on the exposed portions of solder balls <b>62</b>, but rather another integrated circuit package, test board, or other device having solder balls or other electrical connections can be placed directly on the exposed portions of the solder balls <b>62</b>. In one embodiment, the solder balls <b>60</b> likewise are not placed on the solder balls <b>50</b>. Instead, electrical connections on a device that will be connected to the active side of the integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can be directly connected to the exposed portions of the solder balls <b>50</b>. Many other configurations not shown in the figures are also possible in accordance with principles of the present disclosure. All such configurations fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, solder balls <b>50</b> and solder balls <b>62</b> are not solder balls but are other solder structures such as solder columns or blocks. Any suitable solder structures or other electrical connections can be used to connect to the metal redistribution lines <b>54</b>. While the figures have shown an integrated circuit die <b>32</b> in the reconstituted substrate <b>38</b>, other configurations are also possible. Many other types of through via configurations are possible, for example through vias may be formed in the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. Molding compound may then be used to cover metal redistribution lines on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> while redistribution lines are formed on the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, a single integrated circuit package <b>30</b> includes two integrated circuit dies stacked on top of each other. Many other structures and combinations of structures are possible and can be used in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. All such other combinations and possibilities fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method for forming an integrated circuit package <b>30</b> according to one embodiment. The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> includes an integrated circuit die <b>32</b> having an active side on which contact pads are formed as well as an inactive side opposite the active side. At <b>100</b>, the active side of the integrated circuit die is processed to form metal redistribution lines <b>46</b> as described previously. Passivation layers <b>44</b> and <b>48</b> are formed above and below the redistribution lines <b>46</b>. The passivation layers <b>44</b> and <b>48</b> are patterned to allow the redistribution lines <b>46</b> to make electrical contact to the contact pads <b>40</b> and to expose the metal interconnections <b>46</b> to contact to further conductive structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">At <b>102</b>, solder structures <b>50</b> are placed on the exposed portions of the metal interconnections <b>46</b> of the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. At <b>104</b>, the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> is covered in molding compound. The molding compound <b>52</b> covers the redistribution lines <b>46</b> and the passivation layers <b>44</b> and <b>48</b> of the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>. The molding compound <b>52</b> also covers the solder balls <b>50</b> which are placed on the active side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">At <b>106</b>, the inactive side of the integrated circuit die is also processed to form inactive side redistribution lines <b>54</b>. Passivation layers <b>53</b> and <b>56</b> are formed above and below the redistribution lines <b>54</b>. The passivation layers <b>53</b> and <b>56</b> are patterned to allow electrical connection to the redistribution lines <b>54</b>. Because the active side is covered in the molding compound <b>52</b> while the redistribution lines and the passivation layers of the inactive side are being processed, the structures on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> are protected. As described previously, in the absence of the molding compound <b>52</b>, chemicals used to etch the redistribution lines <b>54</b> and passivation layers <b>53</b> and <b>56</b> can seep into the structures on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> and damage them. The molding compound <b>52</b> thus protects the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> during processing of the inactive side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>108</b>, the molding compound <b>52</b> on the active side of the integrated circuit die <b>32</b> is partially removed to expose portions of the solder balls <b>50</b>. The molding compound <b>52</b> can be partially removed by grinding the molding compound <b>52</b> or by etching the molding compound <b>52</b> or by any other suitable procedure. At <b>110</b>, solder balls are placed on the exposed portions of the solder balls <b>50</b> and the redistribution lines <b>54</b>. The integrated circuit package <b>30</b> can now be connected to devices on the active side and the inactive side thereof.</div>
