<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional application No. 61/721,113, filed Nov. 1, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application relates generally to atomic layer deposition of thin films comprising silicon and germanium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">There has been a growing demand for thin oxide films having a variable range of wet etch rates (WER) compared to conventional thermal oxide or CVD oxide films. Additionally, such films desirably have a conformal step-coverage of greater than 95% on a device structure having an aspect ratio of 10:1 or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Atomic layer deposition (“ALD”) is considered a promising method for depositing films having these desired features. As one example, methods for SiO<sub>2 </sub>film deposition by plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (“PEALD”) at low temperatures were developed recently; however, the WER range is limited. The WER of SiO<sub>2 </sub>films remains at about 20 times the WER of conventional thermal oxide. This appears to be the limit on the WER of SiO<sub>2 </sub>films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there has been research into materials other than SiO<sub>2 </sub>that could achieve a higher WER. In some research, GeO<sub>2 </sub>films are considered to be a promising candidate to replace SiO<sub>2 </sub>in many applications in the future. However, GeO<sub>2 </sub>is relatively unstable, in part because it is easily dissolved by water and other solutions.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein are methods for depositing SiGeO films. In some embodiments the films are deposited in a stable, repeatable, and highly controllable manner by an atomic layer deposition-type process. The methods and films are suitable, for example, for use in various semiconductor fabrication processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Methods for forming a silicon germanium oxide thin film on a substrate in a reaction space may be performed using a ALD processes as disclosed herein.

The germanium oxide deposition sub-cycle may include contacting the substrate with a germanium reactant, removing excess germanium reactant, and contacting the substrate with a first oxygen reactant. The silicon oxide deposition sub-cycle may include contacting the substrate with a silicon reactant, removing excess silicon reactant, and contacting the substrate with a second oxygen reactant. In some embodiments, removing comprises flowing a purge gas through the reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to some embodiments, at least one of the first and second oxygen reactants comprises oxygen plasma. The oxygen plasma may be generated from a flowing oxygen source. In some embodiments the oxygen source may flow through the reaction chamber during one or more sub-cycles, during one or more complete silicon germanium oxide deposition cycles, or even throughout the entire process. In some embodiments oxygen plasma may be provided intermittently in the germanium oxide sub-cycle and/or the silicon oxide sub-cycle.

In other embodiments the ratio may be less than or equal to about 1:1. The ratio may be selected such that the silicon germanium oxide thin film has a wet etch rate ratio of between 3 and 400 compared with thermal oxide.

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Methods of depositing SiGeO thin films are disclosed herein. Compared to conventional GeO<sub>2 </sub>processes, in some embodiments the processes disclosed herein may provide a stable, repeatable, and highly controllable film. In some embodiments not only do the films exhibit an extremely high WER that has not been previously observed, but they also achieve a robust lower WER. The presently disclosed processes can be used for various applications, as will be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, the processes can be used in various semiconductor applications. In some embodiments the processes are used to form films used as sacrificial layers, patterning layers, mask layers, layers for use in photolithography, layers used to increase etch selectivity, tunable etch rate layers, for forming air gap layers (such as for DRAM applications), side spacers, SiO capping layers and interlayers, for example between a Ge substrate and a high-k layer. The films may also be used in planar logic and NAND Flash devices. According to some embodiments, the SiGeO films have a desirable etch rate. For example, the films may have a relatively uniform etch rate for both the vertical and the horizontal portions, when deposited onto 3-dimensional structures. Such three-dimensional structures may include, for example and without limitation, FinFETs or other types of multiple gate FETs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments thin film layers are deposited using a process comprising at least one cycle that deposits a germanium oxide layer and at least one cycle that deposits a silicon oxide layer. In some embodiments one or both of the cycles can be atomic layer deposition cycles, and, in some embodiments, may be plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) type deposition cycles. Each of the cycles is repeated to achieve a film of a desired thickness and composition. The amounts of germanium oxide and silicon oxide, and hence the amounts of Ge and Si, may be adjusted relative to each other by varying the number of cycles used to deposit each layer. The result is a SiGeO thin film comprising a desired amount of germanium and silicon. In this way, the properties of the film, such as the etch properties, can be adjusted. As mentioned above, such SiGeO thin films have a wide variety of applications, as will be apparent to the skilled artisan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">This process of alternately depositing a layer of GeO<sub>2 </sub>and SiO<sub>2 </sub>can be described as a laminating process, and the film can be referred to as a GeO<sub>2 </sub>and SiO<sub>2 </sub>laminate. Thus, disclosed herein are various laminating processes for forming a SiGeO thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">ALD can provide precise control of the film composition. In some embodiments controlling the composition of a SiGeO thin film can affect the WER of that film. Additionally, ALD can provide good step coverage. Thus, in some embodiments a SiGeO thin film is deposited over a three dimensional structure, such as a fin in the formation of a finFET device. The thickness and composition of the layers can be controlled to produce a SiGeO film with the desired characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The formula of the silicon oxide is generally referred to herein as SiO<sub>2 </sub>for convenience and simplicity. However, the skilled artisan will understand that the actual formula of the silicon oxide can be SiO<sub>x</sub>, where x varies around 2, as long as some Si—O bonds are formed. Generally silicon oxide where Si has an oxidation state of +IV is formed and the amount of oxygen in the material might vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Similarly, the formula of the germanium oxide is generally referred to herein as GeO<sub>2 </sub>for convenience and simplicity. However, the skilled artisan will understand that the actual formula of the germanium oxide can be GeO<sub>x</sub>, where x varies around 2, as long as some Ge—O bonds are formed. Generally germanium oxide where Ge has an oxidation state of +IV is formed and the amount of oxygen in the material might vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the formula of silicon germanium oxide is generally referred to herein as SiGeO. However, the skilled artisan will understand that the actual stoichiometry of the film will vary. The formula may also be referred to as SiGeO<sub>x</sub>, where x varies around 4 as long as some Ge—O and some Si—O bonds are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">ALD type processes are based on controlled, self-limiting surface reactions. Gas phase reactions are avoided by contacting the substrate alternately and sequentially with reactants. Vapor phase reactants are separated from each other in the reaction chamber, for example, by removing excess reactants and/or reactant byproducts from the reaction chamber between reactant pulses. Removing excess reactants and/or reactant byproducts may be achieved, for example, by purging the reaction space after each pulse of reactant gas using either a vacuum or a purge gas. A purge gas may also be used continuously before, during, and after each pulse of reactant gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The methods presented herein allow deposition of SiGeO films on substrate surfaces. Geometrically challenging applications are also possible due to the nature of the ALD-type processes. According to some embodiments, atomic layer deposition (ALD) type processes are used to form SiGeO films on substrates such as integrated circuit workpieces. The substrate surface may comprise one or more three-dimensional structures. In some embodiments one or more structures may have an aspect ratio of 1:1 to 12:1 or greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">A substrate or workpiece is placed in a reaction chamber and subjected to alternately repeated surface reactions. In particular, SiGeO thin films are formed by repetition of a two or more self-limiting ALD cycles. At least one ALD cycle is used to form SiO<sub>2 </sub>and at least one ALD cycle is used to form GeO<sub>2</sub>. As discussed in more detail below, the GeO<sub>2 </sub>and SiO<sub>2 </sub>deposition cycles may be repeated a predetermined number of times and at a selected ratio in order to deposit a SiGeO film of a desired composition and thickness. In some embodiments, an ALD cycle may result in the deposition of less than a complete layer of either SiO<sub>2 </sub>or GeO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, for forming SiGeO films each ALD cycle comprises at least two distinct phases. The provision and removal of a reactant from the reaction space may be considered a phase. For a GeO<sub>2 </sub>deposition cycle, in a first phase, a first reactant comprising germanium is provided and forms no more than about one monolayer on the substrate surface. This reactant is also referred to herein as “the germanium precursor” or “germanium reactant” and may be, for example, a germanium alkoxide, such as germanium ethoxide (Ge(OEt)<sub>4</sub>), or germanium alkylamino compounds, such as tetrakis(dimethylamino) germanium (TDMAGe). In a second phase, a second reactant comprising oxygen (an “oxygen reactant” or “oxygen precursor”) is provided and may convert adsorbed germanium to germanium oxide. In some embodiments the second reactant comprises a reactive species. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises an excited species. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises oxygen plasma, oxygen atoms, and/or oxygen radicals. Thus, in some embodiments the cycle can be considered a PEALD cycle. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises a species of oxygen that is not excited, such as ozone, and is used, for example, in a thermal ALD process. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises an excited species made by plasma discharge. In some embodiments a reactive species may comprise a He or Ar plasma. In some embodiments a gas that is used to form a plasma may flow constantly throughout the process but only be activated intermittently. For example, oxygen gas may flow constantly throughout the ALD cycle but be subjected to RF power intermittently to form a plasma during the second phase. Additional phases may be added and phases may be removed as desired to adjust the composition of the final film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In a SiO<sub>2 </sub>deposition cycle, a third reactant comprising silicon is provided in a first phase and forms no more than about one monolayer on the substrate surface. This reactant is also referred to herein as “the silicon precursor” or “silicon reactant” and may be, for example, a silicon alkylamino compound, such as BDEAS (bis-diethylaminosilane). In a second phase, a fourth reactant comprising oxygen (an “oxygen reactant” or “oxygen precursor”) is provided and may convert adsorbed silicon to silicon oxide. In some embodiments the oxygen reactant used in the SiO<sub>2 </sub>deposition cycle is the same as the oxygen reactant used in the GeO<sub>2 </sub>deposition cycle, while in other embodiments they may be different. In some embodiments the fourth reactant comprises a reactive species. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises an excited species. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises oxygen plasma, oxygen atoms, and/or oxygen radicals. Thus, in some embodiments the cycle can be considered a PEALD cycle. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises a species of oxygen that is not excited, such as ozone, and is used, for example, in a thermal ALD process. In some embodiments the reactive species comprises an excited species made by plasma discharge. In some embodiments a reactive species may comprise a He or Ar plasma. In some embodiments a gas that is used to form a plasma may flow constantly throughout the process but only be activated intermittently. For example, oxygen gas may flow constantly throughout the ALD cycle but be subjected to RF power intermittently to form a plasma during the second phase. Additional phases may be added and phases may be removed as desired to adjust the composition of the final film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The terms “first,” “second,” “third,” and “fourth” may be applied to any particular precursor or reactive species depending on the sequencing of any particular embodiment. For example, depending on the embodiment the first reactant can be either a silicon precursor, a germanium precursor, an oxygen reactant, and/or a reactive species. Similarly, depending on the embodiment the second reactant can be either a silicon precursor, a germanium precursor, an oxygen precursor, and/or a reactive species. The third reactant can be either a silicon precursor, a germanium precursor, an oxygen precursor, and/or a reactive species. And the fourth reactant can be either a silicon precursor, a germanium precursor, an oxygen precursor, and/or a reactive species. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant is a reactive species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The combination of at least two phases may be considered a sub-cycle. Thus, a process for depositing a SiGeO layer may comprise at least one sub-cycle and at least one sub-cycle. These may also be referred to herein as GeO<sub>2 </sub>cycles and SiO<sub>2 </sub>cycles. The combination of at least two sub-cycles may be considered a super-cycle or a complete SiGeO cycle. Thus, a first phase and a second phase may comprise a first sub-cycle, and a third phase and a fourth phase may comprise a second sub-cycle. These two sub-cycles may each be repeated one or more times in a complete SiGeO deposition cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, a first sub-cycle may be repeated any number of times before initiating a second, different sub-cycle. For example, a GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle may be repeated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more times before initiating a SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle or a SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle may be repeated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more times before initiating a GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle. In some embodiments, a second sub-cycle may be repeated any number of times after completing a first sub-cycle. For example, a GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle may be repeated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more times after one or more SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles or a SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycle may be repeated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or more times after one or more GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles. In some embodiments, a second sub-cycle is performed prior to a first sub-cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">One or more of the reactants may be provided with the aid of a carrier gas, such as Ar or He. In some embodiments the silicon and germanium precursors and the reactive species are provided with the aid of a carrier gas. In some embodiments a reactive species, such as an oxygen reactant, may be generated from a reactant provided with a carrier gas, or from a carrier gas itself. In some embodiments, two of the phases may overlap, at least partially, or be combined. For example, the silicon precursor and the oxygen reactant may be provided simultaneously in pulses that partially or completely overlap and/or, the germanium precursor and the oxygen reactant may be provided simultaneously in pulses that partially or completely overlap. In addition, although referred to as the first and second sub-cycles, and the first, second, third, and fourth reactants, the order may be varied, and an ALD cycle may begin with any one of the sub-cycles and the sub-cycles may begin with any of the reactants. That is, unless specified otherwise, the reactants can be provided in any order and the process may begin with any of the reactants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed in more detail below, in some embodiments for depositing SiGeO, one or more deposition cycles begin with provision of the silicon precursor followed by an oxygen reactant, such as a reactive oxygen species, and then followed by the germanium precursor followed by an oxygen reactant, such as a reactive oxygen species. In other embodiments deposition may begin with provision of the oxygen reactant, such as a reactive oxygen species, followed by either the silicon precursor or the germanium precursor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments the substrate on which deposition is desired, such as a semiconductor workpiece, is loaded into a reactor. The reactor may be part of a cluster tool in which a variety of different processes in the formation of an integrated circuit are carried out. In some embodiments a flow-type reactor is utilized. In some embodiments a high-volume manufacturing-capable single wafer ALD reactor is used. In other embodiments a batch reactor comprising multiple substrates is used. For embodiments in which batch ALD reactors are used, the number of substrates is preferably in the range of 10 to 200, more preferably in the range of 50 to 150, and most preferably in the range of 100 to 130.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Exemplary single wafer reactors, designed specifically to enhance ALD processes, are commercially available from ASM America, Inc. (Phoenix, Ariz.) under the trade names Pulsar® 2000 and Pulsar® 3000 and ASM Japan K.K (Tokyo, Japan) under the trade name Eagle® XP and XP8. Exemplary batch ALD reactors, designed specifically to enhance ALD processes, are commercially available from and ASM Europe B.V (Almere, Netherlands) under the trade names A4ALD™ and A412™.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">According to some embodiments, a desirable WER of a SiGeO film is achieved by controlling the relative concentrations of silicon and germanium in the film and/or by controlling any number of other process parameters during the film's formation. In some cases, it is preferable to describe the WER of any particular silicon germanium film as its wet etch rate ratio (WERR), which is a measure of the WER of the film divided by the WER of a thermal oxide under the same conditions (i.e., WERR=sample wet etch rate [nm/min]/thermal SiO<sub>2 </sub>wet etch rate [nm/min]).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the WERR can be decreased by increasing the number of SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles relative to GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles. Alternatively, the WERR of a silicon germanium film can be increased by decreasing the number of SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles relative to GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles. In some embodiments, increasing the number of SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles is actually achieved by reducing the number of GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles. Similarly, decreasing the number of SiO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles may be achieved by increasing the number of GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, a WERR of about 3 to 4 is achieved in a SiGeO film formed using the methods disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a WERR of about 3 or less than about 3 is achieved in the SiGeO films of the present disclosure. According to some embodiments, a WERR of about 2 is possible. In some SiGeO films deposited according to the present disclosure, the WERR is up to about 120 and, in some films, up to about 400.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, a lower WERR can be achieved by lengthening the amount of time that a plasma is generated in the reaction space during the deposition process. Alternatively, a higher WERR can be achieved by shortening the length of time that a plasma is generated in the reaction space during the deposition process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, if necessary, the exposed surfaces of the workpiece can be pretreated to provide reactive sites to react with the first phase of the ALD process. In some embodiments a separate pretreatment step is not required. In some embodiments the substrate is pretreated to provide a desired surface termination. In some embodiments the substrate is pretreated with plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The reaction chamber is typically purged between reactant pulses. In some embodiments an inert gas is used as a purge gas. The flow rate and time of each reactant is tunable, as is the purge step, allowing for control of the composition of the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, a gas is provided to the reaction chamber continuously during each deposition cycle, or during the entire ALD process. In some embodiments reactive species are provided by generating a plasma in the gas, either in the reaction chamber or upstream of the reaction chamber. In some embodiments the gas is oxygen or comprises oxygen. In other embodiments the gas may be nitrogen, helium or argon or comprise nitrogen, helium or argon. An oxygen reactant may be provided in the gas and a plasma generated in the gas to generate reactive oxygen. The flowing gas may also serve as a purge gas for one or more of the first, second, third, or fourth precursors. For example, flowing oxygen may serve as a purge gas for a first silicon precursor as well as for generating reactive oxygen species for forming SiO<sub>2</sub>. Flowing oxygen may also serve as a purge gas for a first germanium precursor as well as for generating reactive oxygen species for forming GeO<sub>2</sub>. In some embodiments, nitrogen, argon or helium may serve as or be part of a purge gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments the deposition parameters, such as the flow rate, flow time, purge time, temperature, pressure, RF power (if used) and/or the precursors themselves, may be varied in one or more deposition sub-cycles during the ALD process in order to obtain a film with the desired characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The term “pulse” may be understood to comprise feeding reactant (or purge gas or another gas) into the reaction chamber for a predetermined amount of time. The term “pulse” does not restrict the length or duration of the pulse and a pulse can be any length of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The deposition temperature is preferably at or below about 650° C. In some embodiments the deposition temperature is about 50° C. to about 450° C., or about 50° C. to about 400°. In some embodiments, the deposition temperature is about 200° C., 300° C., or 400° C. In some embodiments the deposition temperature may be from about 150 to about 400° C. or from about 200 to about 400° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As mentioned above, the substrate may be treated prior to depositing any germanium or silicon layers by ALD. For example, the substrate may be treated with a passivation chemical to prevent oxidation prior to commencing any ALD sequences. In some embodiments the substrate is treated to form an interfacial layer prior to commencing any ALD sequences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">Germanium Oxide Sub-Cycle</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the germanium precursor is provided first in a germanium oxide sub-cycle. After an initial surface termination, if necessary or desired, a first germanium precursor pulse is supplied to the workpiece. In accordance with some embodiments, the first precursor pulse comprises a carrier gas flow and a volatile germanium species that is reactive with the workpiece surfaces of interest. Exemplary germanium precursors include germanium alkoxides, such as germanium ethoxide (Ge(OEt)<sub>4</sub>), and germanium alkylamino compounds, such as tetrakis(dimethylamino) germanium (TDMAGe). Accordingly, the germanium precursor adsorbs upon the workpiece surfaces. The first precursor pulse self-saturates the workpiece surfaces such that any excess constituents of the first precursor pulse do not further react with the molecular layer formed by this process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The first germanium precursor pulse is preferably supplied in gaseous form. The germanium precursor gas is considered “volatile” for purposes of the present description if the species exhibits sufficient vapor pressure under the process conditions to transport the species to the workpiece in sufficient concentration to saturate exposed surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments the germanium precursor pulse is from about 0.05 to about 5.0 seconds, about 0.1 to about 3 s or about 0.2 to about 1.0 s.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">After sufficient time for a molecular layer to adsorb on the substrate surface, excess first precursor is then removed from the reaction space. In some embodiments the excess first precursor is purged by stopping the flow of the first chemistry while continuing to flow a carrier gas or purge gas for a sufficient time to diffuse or purge excess reactants and reactant by-products, if any, from the reaction space. In some embodiments the excess first precursor is purged with the aid of oxygen gas, or another purge gas, that is flowing throughout the ALD cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the first precursor is purged for about 0.1 to about 10 s, about 0.3 to about 5 s or about 0.3 to about 1 s. Provision and removal of the silicon precursor can be considered the first or silicon phase of the ALD cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In the second phase, the adsorbed first reactant is reacted with an oxygen reactant to form germanium oxide. The oxygen reactant may be, for example, water, ozone, oxygen plasma, oxygen radicals, oxygen atoms, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen oxides NO<sub>x</sub>—wherein x is from about 0.5 to about 3—or other oxygen reactants known to be used in ALD processes. In some embodiments, a reactive species, such as oxygen plasma is provided to the workpiece. An oxygen source, such as oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, may be flowed continuously to the reaction chamber during each ALD cycle in some embodiments. In other embodiments an oxygen source, such as oxygen, is provided intermittently. Oxygen plasma may be formed by generating a plasma in the oxygen source in the reaction chamber itself or upstream of the reaction chamber, for example by flowing the oxygen source through a remote plasma generator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant or oxygen source flows continuously thereby overlapping the germanium reactant pulse. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant or oxygen source is pulsed but overlaps the germanium reactant pulse at least partially. In some embodiments, one or more reactants may decompose or at least partially decompose while in the reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Typically, the oxygen reactant, such as oxygen plasma, is provided for about 0.1 to about 10 seconds. In some embodiments the oxygen reactant, such as oxygen plasma, is provided for about 0.1 to about 10 s, 0.5 to about 5 s or 0.5 to about 2.0 s. However, depending on the reactor type, substrate type and its surface area, the pulsing time may be even higher than 10 seconds. In some embodiments, pulsing times can be on the order of minutes. The optimum pulsing time can be readily determined by the skilled artisan based on the particular circumstances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Oxygen plasma may be generated by applying RF power of from about 10 W to about 1500 W, preferably from about 30 W to about 1000 W, more preferably from about 50 W to about 500 W in some embodiments. The RF power may be applied to oxygen or other oxygen source that flows only during the oxygen plasma pulse time, that flows continuously through the reaction chamber during the sub-cycle or even during the entire SiGeO deposition process, and/or that flows through a remote plasma generator. Thus in some embodiments the plasma is generated in situ, while in other embodiments the plasma is generated remotely and transported to the reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">After a time period sufficient to completely react the previously adsorbed molecular layer with the oxygen reactant, for example the oxygen plasma pulse, any excess reactant and reaction byproducts are removed from the reaction space. As with the removal of the first reactant, this step may comprise stopping the generation of reactive species or provision of reactant and continuing to flow a carrier gas, or in some embodiments the oxygen source gas, for a time period sufficient for excess reactant, such as reactive oxygen species, and volatile reaction by-products to diffuse out of and be purged from the reaction space. In some embodiments a separate purge gas may be used. The purge may, in some embodiments, be from about 0.1 to about 10 s, about 0.1 to about 4 s or about 0.1 to about 0.5 s. Together, the oxygen reactant provision and removal represent a second phase in a germanium oxide atomic layer deposition cycle, and can also be considered an oxidation phase or the germanium oxidation phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The two phases together represent one germanium oxide ALD cycle, which is repeated to form one or more germanium oxide layers. As mentioned above, while referred to as forming a germanium oxide layer, in some embodiments less than a complete molecular layer may be formed in each cycle, for example due to steric interactions that prevent adsorption to all available binding sites. In other embodiments reaction conditions may be such that more than a complete monolayer is formed in each deposition cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">While the ALD cycle is generally referred to herein as beginning with the germanium phase, it is contemplated that in other embodiments the cycle may begin with the oxidation phase. One of skill in the art will recognize that the first precursor phase generally reacts with the termination left by the last phase in the previous cycle. Thus, while no reactant may be previously adsorbed on the substrate surface or present in the reaction space if the oxidation phase is the first phase in the first ALD cycle, in subsequent cycles the oxidation phase will effectively follow the germanium phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The germanium oxide ALD processes described herein can optionally be carried out in a reactor or reaction space connected to a cluster tool. In a cluster tool, because each reaction space is dedicated to one type of process, the temperature of the reaction space in each module can be kept constant, which improves the throughput compared to a reactor in which the substrate is heated up to the process temperature before each run.</div>

Thus, one source of oxygen may be air. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant is molecular oxygen. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant comprises an activated or excited oxygen species. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant comprises ozone. The oxygen reactant may be pure ozone or a mixture of ozone, molecular oxygen, and another gas, for example an inactive gas such as nitrogen or argon.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0126">The Si precursor employed in the ALD type processes may be solid, liquid, or gaseous material under standard conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), provided that the Si precursor is in vapor phase before it is conducted into the reaction chamber and contacted with the substrate surface. Some exemplary silicon precursors are provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0127">As an example, for a 300 mm wafer in a single wafer ALD reactor, a Si precursor may be pulsed for from about 0.05 seconds to about 10 seconds, more preferably for from about 0.1 seconds to about 5 seconds and most preferably for from about 0.3 seconds to about 3.0 seconds. The oxygen-containing precursor, such as oxygen plasma, is preferably pulsed for from about 0.05 seconds to about 10 seconds, more preferably for from about 0.1 seconds to about 5 seconds, most preferably for from about 0.2 seconds to about 3.0 seconds. However, pulsing times can be on the order of minutes in some cases. The optimum pulsing time can be readily determined by the skilled artisan based on the particular circumstances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0128">The oxygen source may be an oxygen-containing gas pulse and can be a mixture of oxygen and inactive gas, such as nitrogen or argon. In some embodiments the oxygen reactant may be a molecular oxygen-containing gas pulse. The preferred oxygen content of the oxygen-source gas is from about 10% to about 25%. Thus, one source of oxygen may be air. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant is molecular oxygen. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant comprises an activated or excited oxygen species. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant comprises ozone. The oxygen reactant may be pure ozone or a mixture of ozone, molecular oxygen, and another gas, for example an inactive gas such as nitrogen or argon. Ozone can be produced by an ozone generator and it is most preferably introduced into the reaction space with the aid of an inert gas of some kind, such as nitrogen, or with the aid of oxygen. In some embodiments, ozone is provided at a concentration from about 5 vol-% to about 40 vol-%, and preferably from about 15 vol-% to about 25 vol-%. In other embodiments, the oxygen reactant is oxygen plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0129">In some embodiments, ozone or a mixture of ozone and another gas is pulsed into the reaction chamber. In other embodiments, ozone is formed inside the reactor, for example by conducting oxygen containing gas through an arc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0130">In other embodiments, an oxygen containing plasma is formed in the reactor. In some embodiments, the plasma may be formed in situ on top of the substrate or in close proximity to the substrate. In other embodiments, the plasma is formed upstream of the reaction chamber in a remote plasma generator and plasma products are directed to the reaction chamber to contact the substrate. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, in the case of a remote plasma, the pathway to the substrate can be optimized to maximize electrically neutral species and minimize ion survival before reaching the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0131">As discussed above, in some embodiments, an ALD process begins with one or more germanium oxide sub-cycles comprising the germanium phase, followed by the oxidation phase and, in turn, one or more silicon oxide sub-cycles comprising the silicon and silicon oxidation phases. However, in other embodiments the one or more silicon oxide sub-cycles comprising the silicon and silicon oxidation phases are first, followed by the one or more germanium oxide sub-cycles comprising germanium and germanium oxidation phases. The oxygen plasma may be generated in situ, for example in an oxygen gas that flows continuously throughout the ALD cycle or that is provided intermittently and activated, or the oxygen plasma may be generated remotely and transported to the reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0132">In some embodiments, the silicon precursor and the oxygen reactant are provided prior to any purge step. Thus, in some embodiments a pulse of silicon precursor is provided, a pulse of oxygen precursor is provided, and any unreacted silicon and oxygen precursor is purged from the reaction space. The silicon precursor and the oxygen precursor may be provided sequentially, beginning with either the silicon or the oxygen reactant, or together. In some embodiments, the silicon precursor and oxygen precursor are provided simultaneously. The ratio of the oxygen precursor to the silicon precursor may be selected to obtain a desired composition of silicon oxide in the deposited thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Mixed Metal Oxide Deposition by ALD</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0133">The SiGeO thin films disclosed herein can be described as mixed metal films where silicon and germanium are referred to as either the first and second metals or the second and first metals. For more information on forming mixed metal films, the benefits of such films, and desirable process parameters, please refer to U.S. Publication No. 2012/0302055, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0134">As discussed above, in some embodiments the silicon germanium oxide is deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) type process comprising multiple complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycles (also referred to as super-cycles). Each complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycle comprises a first deposition sub-cycle for forming up to a monolayer of silicon oxide and a second deposition sub-cycle for forming up to a monolayer of germanium oxide. The number of first deposition sub-cycles and second deposition sub-cycles in each complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycle are varied to achieve the desired composition of the SiGeO film. Further, the number of complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycles is varied to deposit a SiGeO film with the desired thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0135">The germanium content can be expressed as a ratio or percentage of the overall metal content in the film, e.g. germanium/(silicon+germanium). For example, in a mixed metal oxide film comprising Ge and Si, the Ge content can be expressed as Ge/(Ge+Si). In some embodiments the germanium is about 0-10%, 0-20% or about 0-50% of the total metal in the mixed metal oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0136">In some embodiments the first and second deposition sub-cycles are performed at the same reaction temperature. In some embodiments, the first and second deposition sub-cycles are performed in the same reactor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0137">The first and second deposition sub-cycles are provided at a selected ratio to deposit a silicon germanium oxide film with a desired ratio of the germanium to silicon. For example, in some embodiments the ratio of the silicon oxide deposition sub-cycle to the germanium oxide deposition sub-cycle in the complete silicon germanium oxide ALD process may be about 1:20, about 1:10, about 1:6, about 1:5, about 1:4, about 1:2, or about 1:1. In some embodiments the ratio of the germanium oxide deposition sub-cycle to the silicon oxide deposition sub-cycle in each complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycle may be about 1:20, about 1:10, about 1:6, about 1:5, about 1:4, about 1:2, or about 1:1. In some embodiments the ratio of silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles to germanium oxide deposition sub-cycles is the same in all of the complete silicon germanium oxide ALD cycles performed in the ALD process. In other embodiments the specific ratio of silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles to germanium oxide deposition sub-cycles can be varied in different complete ALD cycles. In some embodiments, at least one complete cycle may comprise the deposition of only SiO<sub>2 </sub>or only GeO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, it is possible to achieve pure SiO<sub>2 </sub>or pure GeO<sub>2 </sub>in at least part of the film. The specific ratios can be selected by the skilled artisan to provide the desired amounts of germanium and silicon in the silicon germanium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0138">In some embodiments one or both of the germanium oxide sub-cycle and the silicon oxide sub-cycle can be repeated two or more times in each SiGeO cycle. For example, the silicon oxide sub-cycle can be repeated from one to ten times and the germanium oxide sub-cycle can be repeated from one to ten times in a SiGeO cycle. The number of silicon oxide sub-cycles can be referred to as a and the number of germanium oxide sub-cycles can be referred to as b. In some embodiments a is from 1 to 20 or more and b is from 1 to 20 or more in each SiGeO cycle. In some embodiments a is from 1 to 10 and b is from 1 to 10 in each SiGeO cycle. For example, the ratio of silicon oxide cycles to germanium oxide cycles in a SiGeO cycle may be 3:5. As another example, the ratio of silicon oxide cycles to germanium oxide cycles in a SiGeO cycle may be 5:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0139">It follows that in some embodiments the ALD process will comprise more of the silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles than the germanium oxide deposition sub-cycles.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0277">As shown above, in some embodiments the oxygen source gas may flow continuously throughout the cycle, with oxygen plasma formed intermittently to convert the adsorbed silicon or germanium compound into silicon oxide and germanium oxide, respectively. In some embodiments oxygen plasma is generated remotely and provided to the reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0278">As discussed above, the deposition process typically comprises multiple ALD deposition cycles. In some embodiments, the oxygen reactant is provided in every deposition cycle. In other embodiments, however, the oxygen reactant may be provided in only a portion of the deposition cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0279">As discussed above, the ratio of silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles to germanium oxide sub-cycles may be selected to control the composition of the ultimate film deposited by the PEALD process. For example, for a low germanium density, the ratio of germanium sub-cycles to silicon sub-cycles may be on the order of 1:20. For a higher concentration of germanium, the ratio may range up to about 1:1 or higher such as 2:1, 4:1, 6:1, 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, etc. The composition of the resulting thin film may also be determined by controlling the exposure time of each reactant to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0280">By controlling the ratio of germanium precursor cycle to silicon precursor cycle, the germanium concentration can be controlled from a density range of about 0 atoms of germanium to about 2.43E22/cm<sup>3 </sup>atoms of germanium. Density may be measured, for example, by SIMS (secondary-ion-probe mass spectrometry).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0281">In addition, the germanium density can be varied across the thickness of the film by changing the ratio of germanium precursor cycles to silicon precursor cycles during the deposition process. For example, a high density of germanium may be provided near the substrate surface (lower ratio of silicon precursor cycles to germanium precursor cycle), such as near a Si surface (corresponding to the bottom of the SiGeO surface) and the density of germanium at the top surface away from the substrate may be low (higher ratio of silicon precursor cycles to germanium precursor cycles). In other embodiments a high density of germanium may be provided at the top surface with a lower density near the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0282">The ability to adjust the ratio of sub-cycles is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which shows at least two cycles, cycle <b>200</b> and cycle <b>210</b>, each of which comprises at least two sub-cycles. Where a higher density of germanium is desired near a substrate surface, cycle <b>200</b> may comprise a higher number of germanium oxide deposition sub-cycles <b>220</b> than silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles <b>230</b>. Cycle <b>200</b>, with its higher germanium content, may be repeated a desired number of times, after which cycle <b>210</b> is commenced. In contrast to cycle <b>200</b>, cycle <b>210</b> may include fewer germanium oxide deposition sub-cycles <b>240</b> relative to the silicon oxide deposition sub-cycles <b>250</b>. Cycle <b>210</b> is then repeated a desired number of times. One or more additional cycles may be commenced after completing cycle <b>210</b>. In this way a gradient in the concentration of germanium or silicon is achieved in the resulting thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0283">Deposition temperatures are maintained below the thermal decomposition temperature of the reactants but at a high enough level to avoid condensation of reactants and to provide the activation energy for the desired surface reactions. Of course, the appropriate temperature window for any given ALD reaction will depend upon the surface termination and reactant species involved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0284">The deposition processes can be carried out at a wide range of pressure conditions, but it is preferred to operate the process at reduced pressure. The pressure in the reaction chamber is typically from about 0.1 Pa to about 50000 Pa or more. However, in some cases the pressure will be higher or lower than this range, as can be readily determined by the skilled artisan. The pressure in a single wafer reactor is preferably maintained between about 50 Pa and 1000 Pa, preferably between about 100 Pa and 600 Pa and more preferably between about 150 Pa and 500 Pa. In some embodiments, the pressure in a batch ALD reactor is preferably maintained between about 0.1 Pa and 70 Pa, more preferably between about 4 Pa and about 25 Pa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0285">The reactant source temperature, such as the silicon or germanium source temperature, is preferably set below the deposition or substrate temperature. This is based on the fact that if the partial pressure of the source chemical vapor exceeds the condensation limit at the substrate temperature, controlled layer-by-layer growth of the thin film is compromised.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0294">In general, the source materials, (e.g., silicon source materials and germanium source materials), are preferably selected to have sufficient vapor pressure, sufficient thermal stability at substrate temperature, and sufficient reactivity of the compounds for effecting deposition by ALD. “Sufficient vapor pressure” typically supplies enough source chemical molecules in the gas phase to the substrate surface to enable self-saturated reactions at the surface at the desired rate. “Sufficient thermal stability” typically means that the source chemical itself does not form growth-disturbing condensable phases on the surface or leave harmful level of impurities on the substrate surface through thermal decomposition. In other words, temperatures are kept above the condensation limits and below the thermal decomposition limits of the selected reactant vapors. One aim is to avoid uncontrolled condensation of molecules on the substrate. “Sufficient reactivity” typically results in self-saturation in pulses short enough to allow for a commercially acceptable throughput time. Further selection criteria include the availability of the chemical at high purity and the ease of handling of the chemical.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Applications</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0345">Although the methods disclosed herein could be applied by a skilled artisan to any number of useful applications, the following applications are specifically mentioned to provide some example contexts where the advantages of these methods are readily apparent. For example, the methods disclosed herein are useful for depositing SiGeO thin films to be used as a lining feature, for gap filling, trench filling, formation of an inter-layer of high-K/Ge material on the Ge channel, an inter-layer of SiGeO as a capping layer, or a wide-range selective etching layer. The methods disclosed herein are also useful for forming sacrificial layers, patterning layers, mask layers, layers for use in photolithography, layers used to increase etch selectivity, tunable etch rate layers, layers for forming gap layers, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0346">The methods and materials described herein can provide films with increased quality and improved etch properties not only for traditional lateral transistor designs, with horizontal source/drain (S/D) and gate surfaces, but can also provide improved etch properties for use on non-horizontal (e.g., vertical) surfaces, and on complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. In certain embodiments, SiGeO films are deposited by the disclosed methods on a three-dimensional structure during integrated circuit fabrication. The three-dimensional transistors may include, for example, double-gate field effect transistors (DG FET), and other types of multiple gate FETs, including FinFETs. For example, the silicon germanium oxide thin films of the present disclosure may be useful in nonplanar multiple gate transistors, such as FinFETs, where it may be desirable to form layers on vertical walls, in addition to the tops of the gate, source, and drain regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0347">The SiGeO films of the present disclosure are particularly suitable for applications requiring a sacrificial layer. For this reason the WER of the films is an important factor to consider.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0348">The SiGeO thin films can exhibit particular etching selectivity compared with SiO or SiN films in different etchant such as DHF, SC-1, SC-2, phosphorus acid, and others. Such a property may be advantageous in certain semiconductor manufacturing operations. Also, the composition of the SiGeO films can be adjusted to achieve lower WERRs. Thus, the same materials can be used to achieve films having either low or high WERRs depending on the ratios of silicon and germanium in the resulting films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0349">While the reason for this behavior is not entirely known, without being held to any particular hypothesis, it is supposed that the bonding structure of Si—O—Si, Si—O—Ge and Ge—O—Ge (and others) change dramatically when different ratios of SiO:GeO are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0350">Because of the wide range of achievable WERs, the SiGeO films of some embodiments may be advantageously used in forming air gap layers to be used in applications, such as DRAM applications. Because of the high WERs achievable by some embodiments, it is possible to deposit the films and later selectively etch the film away to create an air gap or other beneficial void space. Alternatively, some SiGeO films having low WERs as disclosed herein may be used where it is desired to etch away other materials, such as materials having an etch rate lower than traditional thermal oxide. In this way, a material may be protected by first depositing a film of SiGeO, etching surrounding materials, and then removing the SiGeO film.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0351">According to some embodiments, a SiGeO thin film is formed by alternately depositing a GeO<sub>2 </sub>layer and a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer, as described above. In some embodiments, tetrakis-dimethylamino germanium is used as germanium source, and bis-diethylaminosilane is used as a silicon source. In many embodiments, the PEALD process contains four process steps: (1) feed time of material gas, (2) purge time, (3) RF time, and (4) after RF plasma ignition purge. Each process step can be controlled to within about 0.05 seconds or even faster.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0370"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an FT-IR analysis of various SiGeO thin films formed using the methods disclosed herein. The SiGeO films were obtained using the following ratios of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and GeO<sub>2 </sub>sub-cycles: 1:2, 1:4, and 1:5.
