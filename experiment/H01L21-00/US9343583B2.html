<heading id="h-0003">DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Thin film transistors (TFTs) are used in various electronic devices, such as flat panel displays. For example, thin film transistors are used as switching elements or driving elements in a flat panel display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, and an electrophoretic display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A thin film transistor includes a gate electrode connected to a gate line to transmit a scanning signal, a source electrode connected to a data line to transmit a signal applied to a pixel electrode, a drain electrode that faces the source electrode, and a semiconductor electrically connected to the source electrode and the drain electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The semiconductor is a factor in determining characteristics of the thin film transistor. The semiconductor may include silicon (Si). The silicon may be amorphous silicon or polysilicon according to a crystallization type thereof. Amorphous silicon allows for a simpler manufacturing process and has relatively low charge mobility. Polysilicon, which has relatively high charge mobility, is subjected to a crystallizing process, such that manufacturing cost is increased and the process is complicated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">To address the properties of amorphous silicon and polysilicon, there is research on thin film transistors using an oxide semiconductor having high uniformity. The oxide semiconductor can have higher electron mobility, a higher ON/OFF ratio, and a lower cost than those of amorphous silicon and/or polysilicon.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an on/off transition of the source-drain current (Ids) according to the gate electrode voltage (Vg) in a thin film transistor Q according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is distinctly identified at a threshold voltage, and an ON current is relatively high, which means that the characteristics of the thin film transistor Q as a switching element are improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a thin film transistor Q according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention experiences no or little change in the threshold voltage according to a change in the source-drain voltage (Vds), such that the thin film transistor Q may maintain uniform characteristics as a switching element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As described above, according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the gate electrode <b>154</b> and the source region <b>133</b> of the thin film transistor Q or the gate electrode <b>154</b> and the drain region <b>135</b> of the thin film transistor Q do not overlap or substantially do not overlap each other such that the parasitic capacitance between the gate electrode <b>154</b> and the source region <b>133</b> or the parasitic capacitance between the gate electrode <b>154</b> and the drain region <b>135</b> may be decreased. Accordingly, the ON current and the mobility of the thin film transistor may be increased and the on/off characteristics of the thin film transistor Q as a switching element may be improved. As a result, a display device with the thin film transistor may have a reduced RC delay. Accordingly, the thickness of the driving signal lines may be decreased, thus resulting in savings in manufacturing costs. Further, the characteristics of the thin film transistor itself are improved, resulting in a reduced size of the thin film transistor and an increased margin for forming a minute channel.</div>
