<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/486,343 filed on Jun. 1, 2012, entitled “A Semiconductor Device and Method of Forming the Same,” and issued as U.S. Pat.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced rapid growth. In the course of the IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs. Such scaling down has also increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC manufacturing are needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, as the semiconductor industry has progressed into nanometer technology process nodes in pursuit of higher device density, higher performance, and lower costs, challenges from both fabrication and design have resulted in the development of multilayer integrated devices such as field effect transistor (FET). The FET device may include interlayer dielectric layers (ILD) having interconnects aligned with underlying layers. However, as the scaling down continues, aligning the interconnects of the ILD layers has proved difficult. Although existing FET devices and methods of fabricating FET devices have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been entirely satisfactory in all respects.</div>

In the present embodiment, the method <b>100</b> is for fabricating a field effect transformer (FET) integrated circuit device. The method <b>100</b> begins at block <b>102</b> where a substrate including sacrificial contact plugs is provided and spacers are formed on sidewalls of the sacrificial contact plugs. The sacrificial contact plugs may include a plurality of contact plugs, based upon design requirements. At block <b>104</b>, a first interlayer dielectric layer (ILD) is formed over the sacrificial contact plugs, the first ILD layer is patterned, thereby removing the first ILD layer in a region between the sacrificial contact plugs and uncovering a top surface of the substrate. After forming the first ILD layer a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process may be performed to remove excess first ILD material. The method continues with block <b>106</b> where a gate structure is formed in the region between the sacrificial contact plugs. The gate structure may also be formed over an uncovered top surface of the substrate. At block <b>108</b> the gate structure is etched back, a hardmask is deposited over etched back gate structure and between the spacers, and a CMP process is performed to remove excess hardmask material. The etching process may include multiple etching steps/process including dry etching, wet etching, or a combination of both. At block <b>110</b>, the sacrificial contact plugs are selectively removed leaving the spacers, and source and drain (S/D) regions are etched in the substrate in a region between the spacers. The method continues with block <b>112</b> where S/D features are epitaxially grown in the S/D region and contacts are formed over the S/D features. A CMP process may be performed to remove excess contact material. At block <b>114</b> a second ILD layer is formed over the substrate, the second ILD is etched to uncover a top surface of the gate structure and a top surface of the contacts, and an interconnect structure is formed that electrically connects the gate structure and the S/D features through the contacts.

As illustrated, a common source and drain feature <b>232</b> (in the center) is shared between the devices. Formed over the common source and drain feature <b>232</b> is an interconnect structure <b>234</b>. The interconnect structure <b>234</b> is in electrical contact with the common source and drain feature <b>232</b> and in contact with a gate spacer <b>220</b>. It is understood that although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref> illustrate only one gate contact and only one interconnect structure, multiple such structures may be present, depending upon design requirements. It is also understood that although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref> illustrate only two gate structures, and only three connects formed over three S/D features, any number of such structures may be present, depending upon design requirements. It is further understood that the active region may include various types of other active devices, passive devices, wiring, contacts, multiple layers, and interconnect structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The above method <b>100</b> provides for an improved alignment (self-alignment) process to form connections to S/D features thereby relaxing the overlay control, reducing manufacturing cost, and device reliability when compared with traditional manufacturing processes. For example, because the contacts to the S/D features are self-aligned contacts (i.e., formed without a need for contact patterning) there are no overlay issues with respect to forming the contacts. Further, because there is no need for contact patterning, cost reduction is realized because additional patterning/etching steps is eliminated. Also, because the contacts are self-aligned, there is no risk of shorting the contact to other structures (e.g., contact-to-gate short). Moreover, the method <b>100</b> can be easily implemented into current manufacturing process and technology, thereby lowering cost and minimizing complexity. Different embodiments may have different advantages, and no particular advantage is necessarily required of any embodiment.</div>
