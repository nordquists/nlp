<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a semiconductor device and method of embedding a thermally conductive layer in the interconnect structure of the device for heat dissipation.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor devices are commonly found in modern electronic products. Semiconductor devices vary in the number and density of electrical components. Discrete semiconductor devices generally contain one type of electrical component, e.g., light emitting diode (LED), small signal transistor, resistor, capacitor, inductor, and power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Integrated semiconductor devices typically contain hundreds to millions of electrical components. Examples of integrated semiconductor devices include microcontrollers, microprocessors, charged-coupled devices (CCDs), solar cells, and digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor devices perform a wide range of functions such as high-speed calculations, transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals, controlling electronic devices, transforming sunlight to electricity, and creating visual projections for television displays. Semiconductor devices are found in the fields of entertainment, communications, power conversion, networks, computers, and consumer products. Semiconductor devices are also found in military applications, aviation, automotive, industrial controllers, and office equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor devices exploit the electrical properties of semiconductor materials. The atomic structure of semiconductor material allows its electrical conductivity to be manipulated by the application of an electric field or base current or through the process of doping. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material to manipulate and control the conductivity of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A semiconductor device contains active and passive electrical structures. Active structures, including bipolar and field effect transistors, control the flow of electrical current. By varying levels of doping and application of an electric field or base current, the transistor either promotes or restricts the flow of electrical current. Passive structures, including resistors, capacitors, and inductors, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform a variety of electrical functions. The passive and active structures are electrically connected to form circuits, which enable the semiconductor device to perform high-speed calculations and other useful functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Semiconductor devices are generally manufactured using two complex manufacturing processes, i.e., front-end manufacturing, and back-end manufacturing, each involving potentially hundreds of steps. Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each die is typically identical and contains circuits formed by electrically connecting active and passive components. Back-end manufacturing involves singulating individual die from the finished wafer and packaging the die to provide structural support and environmental isolation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to produce smaller semiconductor devices. Smaller devices typically consume less power, have higher performance, and can be produced more efficiently. In addition, smaller semiconductor devices have a smaller footprint, which is desirable for smaller end products. A smaller die size may be achieved by improvements in the front-end process resulting in die with smaller, higher density active and passive components. Back-end processes may result in semiconductor device packages with a smaller footprint by improvements in electrical interconnection and packaging materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Another goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to produce higher performance semiconductor devices. An increase in device performance can be accomplished by forming active components that are capable of operating at higher speeds. In some high-performance semiconductor devices, a large number of digital circuits operate with a high frequency clock, e.g., a microprocessor operating in gigahertz range. In other high frequency applications, such as radio frequency (RF) wireless communications, integrated passive devices (IPDs) are often contained within the semiconductor device. Examples of IPDs include resistors, capacitors, and inductors. A typical RF system requires multiple IPDs in one or more semiconductor packages to perform the necessary electrical functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">These high-performance semiconductor devices generate significant heat which must be adequately dissipated. Some semiconductor packages use the encapsulant or build-up interconnect structures to dissipate heat. However, encapsulant or build-up interconnect structures are typically poor thermal conductors. Without effective heat dissipation, the generated heat can reduce performance, decrease reliability, and reduce the useful lifetime of the semiconductor device. In addition, warpage due to differential thermal expansion coefficient between the semiconductor die and build-up interconnect structures can cause die stress and delamination.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">A need exists to adequately dissipate heat in semiconductor devices. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is a semiconductor device comprising a first semiconductor die. A first thermally conductive layer is formed over the first semiconductor die.

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention is described in one or more embodiments in the following description with reference to the figures, in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements. While the invention is described in terms of the best mode for achieving the invention's objectives, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents as supported by the following disclosure and drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Semiconductor devices are generally manufactured using two complex manufacturing processes: front-end manufacturing and back-end manufacturing. Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each die on the wafer contains active and passive electrical components, which are electrically connected to form functional electrical circuits. Active electrical components, such as transistors and diodes, have the ability to control the flow of electrical current. Passive electrical components, such as capacitors, inductors, resistors, and transformers, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform electrical circuit functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Passive and active components are formed over the surface of the semiconductor wafer by a series of process steps including doping, deposition, photolithography, etching, and planarization. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material by techniques such as ion implantation or thermal diffusion. The doping process modifies the electrical conductivity of semiconductor material in active devices, transforming the semiconductor material into an insulator, conductor, or dynamically changing the semiconductor material conductivity in response to an electric field or base current. Transistors contain regions of varying types and degrees of doping arranged as necessary to enable the transistor to promote or restrict the flow of electrical current upon the application of the electric field or base current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Active and passive components are formed by layers of materials with different electrical properties. The layers can be formed by a variety of deposition techniques determined in part by the type of material being deposited. For example, thin film deposition may involve chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrolytic plating, and electroless plating processes. Each layer is generally patterned to form portions of active components, passive components, or electrical connections between components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The layers can be patterned using photolithography, which involves the deposition of light sensitive material, e.g., photoresist, over the layer to be patterned. A pattern is transferred from a photomask to the photoresist using light. The portion of the photoresist pattern subjected to light is removed using a solvent, exposing portions of the underlying layer to be patterned. The remainder of the photoresist is removed, leaving behind a patterned layer. Alternatively, some types of materials are patterned by directly depositing the material into the areas or voids formed by a previous deposition/etch process using techniques such as electroless and electrolytic plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Depositing a thin film of material over an existing pattern can exaggerate the underlying pattern and create a non-uniformly flat surface. A uniformly flat surface is required to produce smaller and more densely packed active and passive components. Planarization can be used to remove material from the surface of the wafer and produce a uniformly flat surface. Planarization involves polishing the surface of the wafer with a polishing pad. An abrasive material and corrosive chemical are added to the surface of the wafer during polishing. The combined mechanical action of the abrasive and corrosive action of the chemical removes any irregular topography, resulting in a uniformly flat surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Back-end manufacturing refers to cutting or singulating the finished wafer into the individual die and then packaging the die for structural support and environmental isolation. To singulate the die, the wafer is scored and broken along non-functional regions of the wafer called saw streets or scribes. The wafer is singulated using a laser cutting tool or saw blade. After singulation, the individual die are mounted to a package substrate that includes pins or contact pads for interconnection with other system components. Contact pads formed over the semiconductor die are then connected to contact pads within the package. The electrical connections can be made with solder bumps, stud bumps, conductive paste, or wirebonds. An encapsulant or other molding material is deposited over the package to provide physical support and electrical isolation. The finished package is then inserted into an electrical system and the functionality of the semiconductor device is made available to the other system components.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a semiconductor device has two packaging levels.

In some embodiments, electronic device <b>10</b> includes a single attached semiconductor package, while other embodiments call for multiple interconnected packages. By combining one or more semiconductor packages over a single substrate, manufacturers can incorporate pre-made components into electronic devices and systems.

The resulting devices are less likely to fail and less expensive to manufacture resulting in a lower cost for consumers.</div>

The IPDs provide electrical characteristics needed for high frequency applications, such as resonators, high-pass filters, low-pass filters, band-pass filters, symmetric Hi-Q resonant transformers, matching networks, and tuning capacitors. The IPDs can be used as front-end wireless RF components, which can be positioned between the antenna and transceiver. The IPD inductor can be a hi-Q balun, transformer, or coil, operating up to 100 Gigahertz. In some applications, multiple baluns are formed over a same substrate, allowing multi-band operation. For example, two or more baluns are used in a quad-band for mobile phones or other global system for mobile (GSM) communications, each balun dedicated for a frequency band of operation of the quad-band device.
