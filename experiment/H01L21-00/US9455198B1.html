<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, the present disclosure relates to the manufacture of semiconductor devices, and, more specifically, to various methods of removing fins so as to form isolation structures on products that include FinFET semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In modern integrated circuit products, such as microprocessors, storage devices and the like, a very large number of circuit elements, especially transistors, are formed on a restricted chip area. In integrated circuits fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology, field effect transistors (FETs) (both NMOS and PMOS transistors) are provided that are typically operated in a switching mode. That is, these transistor devices exhibit a highly conductive state (ON-state) and a high impedance state (OFF-state). FETs may take a variety of forms and configurations. For example, among other configurations, FETs may be either so-called planar FET devices or three-dimensional (3D) devices, such as FinFET devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A field effect transistor (FET), irrespective of whether an NMOS transistor or a PMOS transistor is considered, and irrespective of whether it is a planar or 3D FinFET device, typically comprises a doped source region and a separate doped drain region that are formed in a semiconductor substrate. The source and drain regions are separated by a channel region. A gate insulation layer is positioned above the channel region and a conductive gate electrode is positioned above the gate insulation layer. The gate insulation layer and the gate electrode may sometimes be referred to as the gate structure of the device. By applying an appropriate voltage to the gate electrode, the channel region becomes conductive and current is allowed to flow from the source region to the drain region. The gate structures for such FET devices may be manufactured using so-called “gate-first” or “replacement gate” (gate-last) manufacturing techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast to a FET, which has a planar structure, a so-called FinFET device has a three-dimensional (3D) structure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a perspective view of an illustrative prior art FinFET semiconductor device “A” that is formed above a semiconductor substrate B that will be referenced so as to explain, at a very high level, some basic features of a FinFET device. In this example, the FinFET device A includes three illustrative fins C, a gate structure D, sidewall spacers E and a gate cap layer F. Trenches T are formed in the substrate B to define the fins C. The gate structure D is typically comprised of a layer of gate insulating material (not separately shown), e.g., a layer of high-k insulating material (k-value of 10 or greater) or silicon dioxide, and one or more conductive material layers (e.g., metal and/or polysilicon) that serve as the gate electrode for the device A. The fins C have a three-dimensional configuration: a height H, a width W and an axial length L. The axial length L corresponds to the direction of current travel in the device A when it is operational. The portions of the fins C covered by the gate structure D are the channel regions of the FinFET device A. In a conventional process flow, the portions of the fins C that are positioned outside of the spacers E, i.e., in the source/drain regions of the device A, may be increased in size or even merged together (a situation not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) by performing one or more epitaxial growth processes to grow epitaxial semiconductor material in the source/drain regions. When an appropriate voltage is applied to the gate electrode of a FinFET device, the surfaces (and the inner portion near the surface) of the fins C, i.e., the vertically oriented sidewalls and the top upper surface of the fin, form a surface inversion layer or a volume inversion layer that contributes to current conduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">FETs, including FinFET transistor devices, have an isolation structure, e.g., a shallow trench isolation structure that is formed in the semiconducting substrate around the device so as to electrically isolate the transistor from adjacent transistors. Traditionally, isolation structures were always the first structures that were formed when manufacturing semiconductor devices. The isolation structures were formed by etching the trenches for the isolation structures and thereafter filling the trenches with the desired insulating material, e.g., silicon dioxide. After the isolation structures were formed, various process operations were performed to manufacture the semiconductor device. In the case of a FinFET device, this involved masking the previously formed isolation structure and etching the trenches in the substrate that defined the fins. As FinFET devices have been scaled, i.e., reduced in size, to meet ever increasing performance and size requirements, the width W of the fins C has become very small, e.g., 6-12 nm, and the fin pitch has also been significantly decreased, e.g., the fin pitch may be on the order of about 30-60 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">As the dimensions of the fins became smaller, problems arose with manufacturing the isolation structures before the fins were formed. As one example, trying to accurately define very small fins in regions that were separated by relatively large isolation regions was difficult due to the non-uniform spacing between various structures on the substrate. One manufacturing technique that is employed in manufacturing FinFET devices is to initially form the trenches T in the substrate B to define multiple “fins” (i.e., a “sea of fins”) that extend across the substrate, and thereafter remove some of the fins C where larger isolation structures will be formed. Using this type of manufacturing approach, better accuracy and repeatability may be achieved in forming the fins C to very small dimensions due to the more uniform environment in which the etching process that forms the trenches T is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1I</figref> depict one illustrative prior art process, a so-called “Fins-cut-First” process, of forming fins and isolation structures on a product comprised of a plurality of FinFET devices. Accordingly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after a patterned hard mask layer <b>14</b>, e.g., a patterned layer of silicon nitride (pad nitride) along with a patterned layer of silicon dioxide (pad oxide), was formed above the substrate <b>12</b> in accordance with the desired fin pattern and pitch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after a fin-formation etching process was performed through the patterned masking layer <b>14</b> so as to define a plurality of trenches <b>17</b> in the substrate <b>12</b> that define the fins <b>15</b>. The trenches <b>17</b> are formed to a depth <b>17</b>D, which in some applications may be on the order of about 140-150 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after a layer of insulating material <b>18</b>, such as flowable silicon dioxide (FCVD), was formed so as to overfill the trenches <b>17</b>. The FCVD material may be selected so as to insure substantially complete filling of the relatively narrow and deep trenches <b>17</b>, i.e., high aspect ratio trenches. One downside to the use of the FCVD material is that it is a relatively slow process that increases production time. A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process was then performed to planarize the upper surface of the insulating material <b>18</b> with the top of the patterned hard mask <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after a patterned masking layer <b>20</b>, e.g., a patterned layer of photoresist, was formed above the patterned hard mask layer <b>14</b> and the layer of insulating material <b>18</b>. The patterned masking layer <b>20</b> has openings <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B that are positioned above the fins <b>15</b> to be removed to make room for the isolation structure. In this example, two fins will be removed to make room for the isolation structures. Of course, any number of fins may be removed. The opening <b>20</b>A is depicted as being slightly misaligned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after an isolation-trench etching process was performed through the patterned masking layer <b>20</b> so as to define a plurality of trenches <b>22</b> in the substrate <b>12</b> that define the area where isolation structures will be formed. As depicted, the trenches <b>22</b> are deeper than the trenches <b>17</b>. In one embodiment, the trenches <b>22</b> are formed to a depth <b>22</b>D, which in some applications may be on the order of about 250 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> depicts the product after several process operations were performed. First, another layer of insulating material <b>24</b>, such as silicon dioxide formed by the well-known HARP process, was formed so as to overfill the trenches <b>22</b>. The HARP process may be employed to fill the relatively wider trenches <b>22</b> because it is a faster process, thereby tending to increase production rates. After the deposition of the layer of insulating material <b>24</b>, an anneal process may be performed to densify the various insulating materials. Then, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process was performed to planarize the upper surface of the insulating material <b>24</b> with the top of the patterned hard mask <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after the patterned hard mask layer <b>14</b> was removed (SiN strip followed by oxide deglaze).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref> depicts the device <b>10</b> after an etch-back process was performed to recess the layers of insulating material <b>18</b>, <b>24</b> between the fins <b>15</b> and thereby expose the upper portions of the fins <b>15</b>, which corresponds to the final fin height of the fins <b>15</b>. Unfortunately, due to the different etching characteristic of the insulating materials <b>18</b>, <b>24</b>, the recessed upper surface of the insulating materials <b>18</b>, <b>24</b> is not level or uniform. Such a situation can result in several problems. For example, such an uneven surface may result in fins having an asymmetric profile, as indicated in the dashed-line region <b>26</b>. That is, the height of the exposed sides of the fin may be significantly different, e.g., 6 nm or so. As a result of the asymmetric profile, epitaxial semiconductor material (not shown) formed in the source/drain regions on such asymmetric fins will not be uniform in nature, thereby creating additional downstream processing issues. Another problem that may arise using this prior art process is that some fins may only be partially removed, as depicted in the dashed-line region <b>28</b>. Such a situation may occur to misalignment of the fin-cut mask <b>20</b>. The presence of such partial fins may be problematic in that, depending upon the size and location of such partial fins, epi semiconductor material may undesirably form on such partial fins.</div>

In this illustrative embodiment, the substrate <b>102</b> has a bulk semiconducting material configuration. The substrate <b>102</b> may be made of silicon or it may be made of materials other than silicon.

Also depicted is an illustrative patterned masking layer <b>108</b>, e.g., a patterned hard mask layer comprised of one or more materials that was formed above the layer <b>106</b>. The composition of the illustrative patterned masking layer <b>108</b> is intended to be representative in nature, i.e., additional or fewer layers may be employed in the patterned masking layer <b>108</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the patterned masking layer <b>108</b> includes a stack of materials (oxide, amorphous silicon and nitride (from bottom to top)) formed above the layer <b>106</b>. The pattern of the features in the patterned masking layer <b>108</b> corresponds to the desired pattern of fins to be formed in the substrate <b>102</b>.

Thus, unlike prior art processing techniques that involved performing at least two CMP processes (one to planarize the FCVD oxide material and one to planarize the HARP oxide material), the present invention provides a means to form the insulation material between the fins <b>118</b> as well as the insulation material for the isolation structure by performing a single CMP process operation. This means greater throughput, it produces a more uniform surface since only a single type of insulating material is polished and it results in a more uniform upper surface after the fin-reveal recess etching process is performed, as discussed more fully below.</div>
