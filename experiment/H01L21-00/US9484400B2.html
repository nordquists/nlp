<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The drift layer of a super junction semiconductor device typically includes n-doped and p-doped columns. A high impurity concentration in the n-doped columns results in a low on-state resistance of the semiconductor device. On the other hand, when a reverse voltage is applied, depletion zones extend between the n-doped columns and the p-doped columns in a lateral direction such that a high reverse breakdown voltage can be achieved despite the high impurity concentration in the n-doped columns. It is desirable to improve the forward and reverse characteristics of super junction semiconductor devices.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustrations specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, features illustrated or described for one embodiment can be used on or in conjunction with other embodiments to yield yet a further embodiment. It is intended that the present invention includes such modifications and variations. The examples are described using specific language which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the appending claims. The drawings are not scaled and are for illustrative purposes only. For clarity, the same elements have been designated by the same references in the different drawings if not stated otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The terms “having”, “containing”, “including”, “comprising” and the like are open and the terms indicate the presence of stated structures, elements or features but not preclude additional elements or features. The articles “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural as well as the singular, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The Figures illustrate relative doping concentrations by indicating “−” or “+” next to the doping type “n” or “p”. For example “n<sup>−</sup>” means a doping concentration which is lower than the doping concentration of an “n”-doping region while an “n<sup>+</sup>”-doping region has a higher doping concentration than an “n”-doping region. Doping regions of the same relative doping concentration do not necessarily have the same absolute doping concentration. For example, two different “n”-doping regions may have the same or different absolute doping concentrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The term “electrically connected” describes a low-ohmic connection between the elements electrically connected together, for example a direct contact between the concerned elements or a connection via a metal and/or highly doped semiconductor. The term “electrically coupled” includes that one or more intervening element(s) adapted for signal transmission may be provided between the electrically coupled elements, for example elements that are controllable to temporarily provide a low-ohmic connection in a first state and a high-ohmic electric decoupling in a second state.</div>

The second width is narrower than the first width by at least 10% of the first width.

The widths are narrowed according to both schemes in corner portions of the transition area <b>250</b> connecting orthogonal transition area sections at a slope angle of about 45 degrees.

In accordance with another embodiment the width is reduced in more than one step, for example in at least four steps, each step reducing the widths by five percent of the width in the cell area <b>210</b>.
