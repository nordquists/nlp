All the other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art without creative efforts on the basis of the embodiments of the present invention illustrated shall fall within the scope of protection of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">One technical problem to be solved by the embodiment of the present invention is to form an array substrate with simple process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">For instance, the method for manufacturing the array substrate provided by the embodiment of the present invention comprises the following steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Step S<b>1</b>: forming patterns of an active layer <b>202</b> of a driving TFT, an active layer of a switching TFT and a pixel electrode on the same layer on a base substrate <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The step S<b>1</b>, for instance, may be performed as follows. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an amorphous silicon (a-Si) film is formed on the base substrate <b>201</b> and the a-Si film is crystallized to form a polysilicon film. The a-Si film may be formed by a plurality of methods such as deposition, coating and sputtering. The crystallization process may adopt the means of u-crystallization, laser annealing, metal-induced crystallization (MIC), metal-induced lateral crystallization (MILC) or continuous grain silicon (CGS). The polysilicon film is patterned to form the pattern of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT. The patterning process, for instance, includes photoresist coating, exposure, development, etching, photoresist removing and the like. The active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT formed herein is made of polysilicon materials. In one example, the driving TFT may be a PMOS transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the corresponding active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the corresponding pixel electrode <b>204</b> are formed on the same layer with the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT. The process of forming the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the pixel electrode <b>204</b> may adopt the following two modes:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Mode 1: forming a transparent conductive film and forming a pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b> by the patterning process; and forming a metal oxide semiconductor film and forming a pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT by the patterning process, in which the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT, the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the pixel electrode <b>204</b> are on the same layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Mode 2: forming a metal oxide semiconductor film (for instance, an IGZO film, a ZnO film, an IZO film, an ITZO film or an HIZO film) and forming the patterns of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the pixel electrode <b>204</b> by the patterning process, namely the pixel electrode <b>204</b> and the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT are made of the same material, and the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT, the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the pixel electrode <b>204</b> are on the same layer. Compared with the mode 1, the mode 2 can reduce the use of one mask and hence save more process. In one example, the switching TFT may be an NMOS transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Step S<b>2</b>: as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, forming patterns of a gate insulating layer <b>205</b>, a gate electrode <b>206</b> of the driving TFT and a gate electrode <b>207</b> of the switching TFT on the base substrate as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The step S<b>2</b>, for instance, may further comprise:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">forming a gate insulating film which is taken as the gate insulating layer <b>205</b>; and forming a gate metal film on the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and respectively forming patterns of the gate electrode <b>206</b> of the driving TFT and the gate electrode <b>207</b> of the switching TFT at areas corresponding to the pattern of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT and the pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT by the patterning process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Step S<b>3</b>: as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, doping the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT. The step S<b>3</b> may be for instance performed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">A layer of photoresist <b>300</b> is coated and exposure and development are performed on the photoresist <b>300</b> via a mask to retain the photoresist <b>300</b> at the area of the pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and an area of the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b>, the photoresist <b>300</b> at the area of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT is removed by development so as to expose the pattern of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the doping process, the photoresist <b>300</b> is configured to shield the area of the pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT and the area of the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b>; the gate electrode <b>206</b> over the active layer <b>202</b> is configured to shield one part of the area of the active layer <b>202</b>; and the area of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT, which is not shielded by the gate electrode <b>206</b>, is subjected to doping treatment. The retained photoresist <b>300</b> is removed after the doping process and the doped active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT is formed. In one example, the driving TFT is, for instance, a PMOS transistor. Therefore, in this case, the doping process is, for instance, the P+ doping process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Step S<b>4</b>: forming patterns of an insulating spacer layer <b>208</b>, a through hole formed on the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and a pixel electrode recess <b>800</b>, in which one part of the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b> is exposed via the pixel electrode recess <b>800</b>. The substrate obtained after the step is as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The step S<b>4</b> may for instance be performed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">An insulating film, taken as the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b>, is formed on the substrate as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A first through hole <b>400</b>, which runs through the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and reaches the pattern of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT at an area corresponding to a source electrode of the driving TFT to be formed, is formed by the patterning process; a second through hole <b>500</b>, which runs through the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and reaches the pattern of the active layer <b>202</b> of the driving TFT at an area corresponding to a drain electrode of the driving TFT to be formed, is formed by the patterning process; a third through hole <b>600</b>, which runs through the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and reaches the pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT at an area corresponding to a source electrode of the switching TFT to be formed, is formed by the patterning process; a fourth through hole <b>700</b>, which runs through the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and reaches the pattern of the active layer <b>203</b> of the switching TFT at an area corresponding to a drain electrode of the switching TFT to be formed, is formed by the patterning process; and a pixel electrode recess <b>800</b>, which runs through the insulating spacer layer <b>208</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>205</b> and reaches the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b> at an area corresponding to the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>204</b>, is formed. The first through hole, the second through hole, the third through hole, the fourth through hole and the pixel electrode recess <b>800</b> may be formed by the same mask simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Step S<b>5</b>: forming patterns of a source electrode <b>209</b> and a drain electrode <b>209</b>′ of the driving TFT and patterns of a source electrode <b>210</b> and a drain electrode <b>210</b>′ of the switching TFT. The drain electrode <b>209</b>′ of the driving TFT is, for instance, connected to the pixel electrode <b>204</b>, and the drain electrode of the switching TFT is, for instance, connected to the source electrode of the driving TFT. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, source and drain metal films are formed and the patterns of the source electrode <b>209</b> and the drain electrode <b>209</b>′ of the driving TFT and the patterns of the source electrode <b>210</b> and the drain electrode <b>210</b>′ of the switching TFT are formed by the patterning process, in which the drain electrode <b>209</b>′ of the driving TFT is connected to the pixel electrode <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Step S<b>6</b>: forming a pattern of a pixel define layer <b>211</b>. The step may, for instance, be performed as follows. An insulating film made of resin materials is formed; and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the pattern of the pixel define layer <b>211</b> is formed by the pattering process to cover all the other areas on the base substrate except for an area A of the pattern of the exposed pixel electrode <b>204</b>. The exposed pixel electrode <b>204</b> may be taken as an anode of a subsequently formed organic light-emitting diode (OLED).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In the method for manufacturing the array substrate provided by the embodiment, the pixel electrode is manufactured on the same layer with the active layers of the driving TFT and the switching TFT, so that the number of required mask processes can be reduced. For instance, only 8 mask processes are required. Moreover, the pixel electrode and the active layer of the switching TFT may be manufactured simultaneously by the same material, so that the number of the required mask processes can be further reduced. For instance, only 7 mask processes are required. Therefore, the number of the mask processes in the manufacturing process is reduced and hence the process flow and the manufacturing cost are reduced. In addition, as the application does not need to adopt the LTPS technology to form the oxide TFT applied to the switching TFT, and the tact time during the crystallization can be reduced and the service life of a laser tube can be prolonged, and hence the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, in the process of manufacturing a CMOS array display panel, for instance, an oxide TFT is, for instance, formed at a display area of an array substrate and taken as a switching TFT; and a gate driver on array (GOA) shift resister and TFTs on the peripheral area may be formed by the LTPS technology, and hence the driving TFT formed by the LTPS technology is only disposed on the peripheral area. Therefore, the laser annealing process used for preparing the driving TFT only requires the crystallization of a GOA shift register area and the peripheral area, but not all the areas of the array substrate, and hence the tact time during the crystallization can be reduced and the service life of a laser tube can be prolonged, and consequently the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The embodiment of the present invention further provides an array substrate manufactured by the above method.
