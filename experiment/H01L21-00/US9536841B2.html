<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As known in the art, electronic components, such as radio frequency (RF) components, are easily interfered with by electromagnetic interference (EMI). Therefore, it is necessary or desirable to provide electromagnetic (EM) shielding for such components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, a conventional EM shielding structure includes a prefabricated metal lid mounted on a chip in order to achieve the EM shielding effect. However, the conventional EM shielding metal lid is designed and fabricated according to various modules or devices, and is therefore not cost-effective. The prefabricated metal lid is usually fixed on a surface of the substrate. Therefore, the prefabricated metal lid undesirably occupies larger surface area and does not provide adequate EM shielding effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, what is needed is to provide an improved EM shielding structure for the semiconductor packages that has greater reliability and that can be produced at lower cost, in order to overcome the prior art shortcomings.</div>

A conformal EM shielding layer is formed on each of the semiconductor packages. The conformal EM shielding layer covers the mold compound and the sidewall of the substrate. The conformal EM shielding layer is in direct contact with the exposed portion of the EM shielding contact structure.</div>
