<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In this specification, a semiconductor device means all types of devices which can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics, and an electro-optical device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic appliance are all semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, transistors that are formed using a semiconductor thin film having a thickness of several nanometers to several hundreds of nanometers over a substrate having an insulating surface such as a glass substrate have been attracting attentions. Transistors are widely used for electronic devices such as integrated circuits (ICs) and electro-optical devices. In particular, transistors are urgently developed as switching elements of display devices typified by liquid crystal display devices, EL display devices, electronic paper, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In an active matrix liquid crystal display device, a voltage is applied between a pixel electrode connected to a selected switching element and a counter electrode corresponding to the pixel electrode, and thus, a liquid crystal layer disposed between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode is modulated optically. The optical modulation can be recognized as a display pattern by an observer. An active matrix liquid crystal display device here means a liquid crystal display device which employs a method in which a display pattern is formed on a screen by driving pixel electrodes arranged in matrix using switching elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In an active matrix EL display device, where a plurality of switching elements is disposed in a pixel, voltage is applied to a light-emitting element electrically connected to at least one of the switching elements, whereby electrons and holes are separately injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus, the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Because of such a mechanism, the light-emitting element is called a current-excitation light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The range of uses of such an active matrix display device is expanding, and demands for larger screen size, higher definition, and higher aperture ratio are increasing. In addition, it is demanded that a production method of the active matrix display device offer high fabrication yield and reduce production cost. Simplification of a process is one way for increasing productivity and reducing manufacturing cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In active matrix display devices, transistors are mainly used as switching elements. In manufacturing transistors, reduction in the number of photolithography steps or simplification of the photolithography step is important for simplification of the whole process. For example, when one photolithography step is added, the following steps are further needed: resist application, prebaking, light exposure, development, post-baking, and the like and, moreover, steps before and after the aforementioned steps, such as film formation, etching, resist removal, and cleaning and drying a substrate. The number of steps is significantly increased only by adding one photolithography step in the manufacturing process. Therefore, many techniques for reducing the number of photolithography steps or simplifying the photolithography step in a manufacturing process have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Transistors are broadly classified into top-gate transistors, in which a channel formation region is provided below a gate electrode, and bottom-gate transistors, in which a channel formation region is provided above a gate electrode. These transistors are generally manufactured using at least five photomasks. Further, when a spacer for keeping a space between a pair of substrates is formed through a photolithography step in order to hold a liquid crystal layer between the pair of substrates, a liquid crystal display device is manufactured with six or more photomasks in total.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Many conventional techniques for simplifying the photolithography step use a complicated technique such as backside light exposure (e.g., Patent Document 1), resist reflow, or a lift-off method, which requires a special apparatus in many cases. Using such complicated techniques may cause various problems, thereby leading to reduction in yield.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to reduce the number of photolithography steps used for manufacturing a transistor and a display device to less than the conventional one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to reduce the number of photomasks used for manufacturing a transistor and manufacturing a display device to less than the conventional one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a display device with low power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">A step of forming a gate electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer) and a step of forming an island-like semiconductor layer are performed through one photolithography step, whereby a semiconductor device can be manufactured with the number of photomasks and the number of photolithography steps reduced to less than the conventional one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">A semiconductor device is manufactured through, in total, three photolithography steps including one photolithography step which serves as both a step of forming a gate electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer) and a step of forming an island-like semiconductor layer, one photolithography step of forming a contact hole after a planarization insulating layer is formed, and one photolithography step which serves as both a step of forming a source electrode and a drain electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer) and a step of forming a pixel electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer). Note that a photolithography step refers to a step in which a resist formed over a film is exposed to light through a photomask and development is performed to form a resist mask, and then the film is etched using the resist mask. That is, one photomask is used in one photolithography step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">A conductive layer to be a gate electrode, an insulating layer to be a gate insulating layer, a semiconductor layer, and an insulating layer to be a channel protective layer, which are each included in a transistor, are successively formed, and a resist mask having a large thickness and a small thickness, which is exposed to light and developed using a multi-tone mask as a first photomask, is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The conductive layer to be a gate electrode, the insulating layer to be a gate insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, and the insulating layer to be a channel protective layer are etched using the resist mask as a mask. Subsequently, the resist mask having a small thickness is removed so that a remaining conductive layer to be a gate electrode, a remaining insulating layer to be a gate insulating layer, a remaining semiconductor layer, and a remaining insulating layer to be a channel protective layer are exposed. Further, the insulating layer to be a gate insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, and the insulating layer to be a channel protective layer are etched using the remaining resist mask as a mask so that a gate electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer), an island-like gate insulating layer, an island-like semiconductor layer, and an island-like channel protective layer are formed. After that, the resist mask is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In such a manner, the gate electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer) and the island-like semiconductor layer can be formed through one photolithography step. At this time, the side surfaces of the island-like gate insulating layer, the island-like semiconductor layer, and the island-like channel protective layer on each side are substantially aligned with one another, and each layer has a substantially similar shape when seen from the above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In this specification, “layers in which the side surfaces on one side are substantially aligned with one another” means that outlines of the side surfaces of the layers on one side are substantially aligned as seen from the above, including the case where upper end portions and lower end portions of the layers are aligned, the case where the side surface of one layer is recessed with respect to the side surface of another layer, and the case where tapered shapes of the side surfaces on each side of the layers are different from one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the end portions of the gate electrode are projected outside the end portions of the island-like gate insulating layer, the island-like semiconductor layer, and the island-like channel protective layer, whereby a step is suppressed and coverage with an insulating layer or a conductive layer which will be formed later can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Then, a planarization insulating film is formed, and a contact hole is formed through a photolithography step using a second photomask. After that, a first conductive layer to be a pixel electrode and a second conductive layer to be a source electrode or a drain electrode are successively formed, and a resist mask having a large thickness and a small thickness, which is exposed to light and developed using a multi-tone mask as a third photomask, is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The first conductive layer to be a pixel electrode and the second conductive layer to be a source electrode or a drain electrode are etched using the resist mask as a mask. Subsequently, part of the resist mask is removed and the second conductive layer is exposed. The second conductive layer to be a source electrode or a drain electrode is etched using the remaining resist mask as a mask to form a source electrode or a drain electrode (including another electrode or a wiring which is formed in the same layer), and the first conductive layer to be a pixel electrode is exposed. After that, the resist mask which remains in contact with the top surface of the source electrode or the drain electrode is removed. As a result, a transistor can be manufactured using three photomasks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">After that, when a spacer for keeping a space between a pair of substrates is formed through a photolithography step, a liquid crystal display device can be manufactured with four photomasks in total.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, when the resist mask is not removed and used as a spacer for keeping a space between a pair of substrates, a liquid crystal display device can be manufactured with three photomasks in total. Alternatively, in the case of using a spherical spacer as the spacer, a liquid crystal display device can be manufactured with three photomasks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">A pixel electrode and a counter electrode may be provided only on one of the substrates instead of providing the counter electrode on a counter substrate so that a liquid crystal display device in a horizontal electrical field mode (an IPS method or an FFS method) can be manufactured. With the steps disclosed in this specification, a pixel electrode and a counter electrode can be provided only on one of the substrates without an increase in the number of masks; therefore, a liquid crystal display device can be manufactured with three photomasks in total. When a pixel electrode and a counter electrode are provided only on one of the substrates, a structure without a conductive spacer for making conduction with a counter electrode of a counter substrate can be employed. In the case of providing a conductive spacer, it is necessary that a counter electrode of a counter substrate and an electrode pad for taking a fixed potential, which is formed over a substrate provided with a transistor, be precisely aligned with each other to make conduction, and this might lead a decrease in yield. When a pixel electrode and a counter electrode are provided only on one of the substrates, the alignment of a counter substrate does not need to be performed so precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, in a display device, a protective circuit for protecting a transistor and the like in a pixel is preferably formed over the same substrate. With the steps disclosed in this specification, a protective diode in which a drain electrode and a gate electrode of a transistor are electrically connected to each other can be formed without an increase in the number of masks. The reliability of the display device can be improved by forming the protective diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, in a display device, a driver circuit for driving a transistor in a pixel can be formed over the same substrate. With the steps disclosed in this specification, a driver circuit in which a drain electrode and a gate electrode of a transistor are electrically connected to each other can be formed without an increase in the number of masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In manufacturing an EL display device, a plurality of transistors is provided in one pixel, and, for example, a contact is formed in a manner such that a source electrode or a drain electrode of one transistor is electrically connected to a gate electrode of another transistor in order to connect the plurality of transistors to one another other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">With the steps disclosed in this specification, the contacts can be formed without an increase in the number of masks; therefore, a plurality of transistors in which a gate electrode of one transistor and a drain electrode of another transistor are connected to each other can be manufactured with three photomasks. Then, a partition wall for insulating adjacent pixel electrodes is formed with one photomask; therefore, an EL display device can be manufactured with four photomasks in total.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that the mode and details can be changed in various different ways. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the following description of the embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">A transistor is one kind of semiconductor elements and can amplify current or voltage and perform a switching operation for controlling conduction or non-conduction, for example. A transistor in this specification includes an insulated-gate field effect transistor (IGFET) and a thin film transistor (TFT).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Functions of a “source” and a “drain” of a transistor might interchange when a transistor of opposite polarity is used or the direction of current flow is changed in circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms “source” and “drain” can be used to denote the drain and the source, respectively, in this specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, in this specification and the like, the term such as “electrode” or “wiring” does not limit a function of a component. For example, an “electrode” is sometimes used as part of a “wiring”, and the “wiring” can be used as part of the “electrode”. Further, the term “electrode” or “wiring” can also mean a combination of a plurality of “electrodes” and “wirings” formed in an integrated manner.</div>

The semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes a pixel region <b>102</b>, a terminal portion <b>103</b> including m terminals <b>105</b> (<b>105</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>105</b>-m and m is an integer of greater than or equal to 1) and a terminal <b>107</b>, and a terminal portion <b>104</b> including n terminals <b>106</b> (<b>106</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>106</b>-n and n is an integer of greater than or equal to 1) over a substrate <b>101</b>. Further, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes m wirings <b>212</b> electrically connected to the terminal portion <b>103</b>, n wirings <b>216</b> electrically connected to the terminal portion <b>104</b>, and a wiring <b>203</b>. The pixel region <b>102</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>110</b> arranged in matrix of m rows (in the longitudinal direction)×n columns (in the transverse direction). The pixel <b>110</b> (i,j) (i is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to m, and j is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n) in the i-th row and the j-th column is electrically connected to a wiring <b>212</b>-i and a wiring <b>216</b>-j. In addition, each pixel is connected to the wiring <b>203</b> functioning as a capacitor electrode or a capacitor wiring, and the wiring <b>203</b> is electrically connected to the terminal <b>107</b>. The wiring <b>212</b>-i is electrically connected to a terminal <b>105</b>-i, and the wiring <b>216</b>-j is electrically connected to a terminal <b>106</b>-j.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The terminal portion <b>103</b> and the terminal portion <b>104</b> are external input terminals and are connected to external control circuits with flexible printed circuits (FPC) or the like. Signals supplied from the external control circuits are input to the semiconductor device <b>100</b> through the terminal portion <b>103</b> and the terminal portion <b>104</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, such terminal portions <b>103</b> are provided on the right and left of the pixel region <b>102</b>, so that signals are input from two directions. Further, such terminal portions <b>104</b> are provided above and below the pixel region <b>102</b>, so that signals are input from two directions. By inputting signals from two directions, signal supply capability is increased and high-speed operation of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> is facilitated. In addition, influences of signal delay due to an increase in size of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> or an increase in wiring resistance accompanied by an increase in definition can be reduced. Moreover, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> can have redundancy, so that the reliability of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> can be improved. Although two terminal portions <b>103</b> and two terminal portions <b>104</b> are provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a structure in which one terminal portion <b>103</b> and one terminal portion <b>104</b> are provided may also be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates a configuration example of the pixel <b>110</b> used in the semiconductor device <b>100</b>. The pixel <b>110</b> includes a transistor <b>111</b>, a liquid crystal element <b>112</b>, and a capacitor <b>113</b>. A gate electrode of the transistor <b>111</b> is electrically connected to the wiring <b>212</b>-i, and one of a source electrode and a drain electrode of the transistor <b>111</b> is electrically connected to the wiring <b>216</b>-j. The other of the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor <b>111</b> is electrically connected to one electrode of the liquid crystal element <b>112</b> and one electrode of the capacitor <b>113</b>. The other electrode of the liquid crystal element <b>112</b> is electrically connected to an electrode <b>114</b>. The potential of the electrode <b>114</b> may be a fixed potential such as 0 V, GND, or a common potential. The other electrode of the capacitor <b>113</b> is electrically connected to the wiring <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The transistor <b>111</b> functions as a switching element. The capacitor <b>113</b> functions as a storage capacitor. The capacitor <b>113</b> need not necessarily be provided; however, in the case of providing the capacitor <b>113</b>, variation in the potential applied to the liquid crystal element <b>112</b>, which is caused by a current flowing between the source electrode and the drain electrode in an off state of the transistor <b>111</b> (off-state current), can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">For a semiconductor layer where a channel of the transistor <b>111</b> is formed, a single crystal semiconductor, a polycrystalline semiconductor, a microcrystalline semiconductor, an amorphous semiconductor, or the like can be used. Examples of a semiconductor material include silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, and gallium arsenide. Alternatively, an oxide semiconductor can be used for the semiconductor layer where a channel of the transistor <b>111</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In general, the electron affinity of silicon, germanium, or the like is lower than the work function of metal. Therefore, in the case where it is necessary to obtain an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer including silicon or germanium, and the source electrode or the drain electrode, it is necessary to provide an ohmic contact layer therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">However, since the electron affinity of an oxide semiconductor is higher than that of silicon or germanium, an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer including an oxide semiconductor, and the source electrode or the drain electrode can be obtained without an ohmic contact layer therebetween. For example, since the electron affinity of an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is about 4.3 eV, an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer, and the source electrode or the drain electrode can be obtained without an ohmic contact layer in such a manner that an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is used for the semiconductor layer, and titanium which has a work function of about 4.1 eV, titanium nitride which has a work function of about 4.0 eV, or the like is used for the source electrode or the drain electrode connected to the semiconductor layer. With the use of an oxide semiconductor for the semiconductor layer, a manufacturing process of a semiconductor device can be simplified; thus, the productivity of the semiconductor device can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Note that an oxide semiconductor which is purified (purified OS) by supply of oxygen after reduction of an impurity such as moisture or hydrogen which serves as an electron donor (donor) can be made to be an i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor extremely close to an i-type semiconductor (a substantially i-type oxide semiconductor). Accordingly, a transistor including the oxide semiconductor in a semiconductor layer where a channel is formed has characteristics of very small off-state current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, a configuration example of the pixel used in a liquid crystal display device will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In the cross section A<b>1</b>-A<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an insulating layer <b>201</b> is formed over a substrate <b>200</b>, and a gate electrode <b>202</b> and the wiring <b>203</b> are formed over the insulating layer <b>201</b>. The insulating layer <b>201</b> functions as a base layer. Over the gate electrode <b>202</b>, an insulating layer <b>204</b> functioning as a gate insulating layer, a semiconductor layer <b>205</b>, and an insulating layer <b>214</b> and the insulating layer <b>215</b> each functioning as a channel protective layer are provided. In addition, the insulating layer <b>215</b> is formed so as to cover the side surfaces of the semiconductor layer <b>205</b> and also has a function of preventing entry of an impurity from the side surfaces of the semiconductor layer <b>205</b>. Further, a planarization insulating layer <b>218</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>215</b>. Further, a pixel electrode <b>211</b> <i>b </i>is formed over the planarization insulating layer <b>218</b>, and electrically connected to the semiconductor layer <b>205</b> through contact holes <b>208</b> formed in the insulating layers <b>214</b> and <b>215</b> and the planarization insulating layer <b>218</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The wiring <b>203</b> functions as a capacitor electrode or a capacitor wiring. A portion where the wiring <b>203</b> and the pixel electrode <b>211</b> <i>b </i>overlap with each other with the insulating layer <b>215</b> and the planarization insulating layer <b>218</b> provided therebetween functions as the capacitor <b>113</b>. The insulating layer <b>215</b> and the planarization insulating layer <b>218</b> function as a dielectric layer of the capacitor <b>113</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Note that in the transistor <b>111</b>, the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b </i>is surrounded by the source electrode <b>206</b> <i>a </i>that is U-shaped (or C-shaped, square-bracket-like shaped, or horseshoe-shaped). With such a shape, an enough channel width can be ensured even when the area of the transistor <b>111</b> is small, and accordingly, the amount of current flowing between the source and the drain at the time of conduction of the transistor (also referred to as the on-state current) can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">If parasitic capacitance generated between the gate electrode <b>202</b> and the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b </i>electrically connected to the pixel electrode <b>211</b> <i>b </i>is large, the transistor is easily influenced by feedthrough, which may cause degradation in display quality because the potential supplied to the liquid crystal element <b>112</b> cannot be held accurately. With the structure in which the source electrode <b>206</b> <i>a </i>is U-shaped and surrounds the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b</i>, an enough channel width can be ensured and parasitic capacitance generated between the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b </i>and the gate electrode <b>202</b> can be reduced. Therefore, the display quality of a display device can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, when one of the source electrode <b>206</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b </i>or both are provided so that a channel formation region of the transistor <b>111</b> is covered as much as possible, one of the source electrode <b>206</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>206</b> <i>b </i>or both can function as a light-blocking layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">By forming the insulating layers and the semiconductor layer described above between the wiring <b>216</b>-j and the wiring <b>212</b>-i, the distance in the film thickness direction between both the wirings can be increased; thus, parasitic capacitance in the intersection of the wiring <b>216</b>-j and the wiring <b>212</b>-i can be reduced. By reducing the parasitic capacitance in the intersection, delay of a signal supplied to the wiring <b>216</b>-j and the wiring <b>212</b>-i or distortion of the waveform can be reduced; thus, a display device with high display quality can be achieved.</div>

The liquid crystal composition which includes a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral agent has a short response time of 1 msec or less, and has optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded and viewing angle dependence small. In addition, since an alignment film does not need to be provided and rubbing treatment is unnecessary, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented and defects and damage of the liquid crystal display device can be reduced in the manufacturing process.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">For a semiconductor layer where a channel of the transistors <b>511</b> and <b>517</b> are formed, a single crystal semiconductor, a polycrystalline semiconductor, a microcrystalline semiconductor, an amorphous semiconductor, or the like can be used. Examples of a semiconductor material include silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, and gallium arsenide. Alternatively, an oxide semiconductor can be used for the semiconductor layer where a channel of the transistors <b>511</b> and <b>517</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">In general, the electron affinity of silicon, germanium, or the like is lower than the work function of metal. Therefore, in the case where it is necessary to obtain an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer including silicon or germanium, and the source electrode or the drain electrode, it is necessary to provide an ohmic contact layer therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">However, since the electron affinity of an oxide semiconductor is higher than that of silicon or germanium, an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer including an oxide semiconductor, and the source electrode or the drain electrode can be obtained without an ohmic contact layer therebetween. For example, since the electron affinity of an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is about 4.3 eV, an ohmic contact between the semiconductor layer, and the source electrode or the drain electrode can be obtained without an ohmic contact layer in such a manner that an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is used for the semiconductor layer, and titanium which has a work function of about 4.1 eV, titanium nitride which has a work function of about 4.0 eV, or the like is used for the source electrode or the drain electrode connected to the semiconductor layer. With the use of an oxide semiconductor for the semiconductor layer, a manufacturing process of a semiconductor device can be simplified; thus, the productivity of the semiconductor device can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Note that an oxide semiconductor which is purified (purified OS) by supply of oxygen after reduction of an impurity such as moisture or hydrogen which serves as an electron donor (donor) can be made to be an i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor extremely close to an i-type semiconductor (a substantially i-type oxide semiconductor). Accordingly, a transistor including the oxide semiconductor in a semiconductor layer where a channel is formed has characteristics of very small off-state current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Next, a configuration example of the pixel used in a light-emitting display device will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view.

The insulating layer <b>525</b> functions as a dielectric layer of the capacitor <b>513</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">The light-emitting element <b>515</b> includes a pixel electrode <b>532</b> <i>a</i>, a cathode <b>539</b>, and a light-emitting layer <b>538</b>. Note that the light-emitting intensity of the light-emitting layer <b>538</b> varies depending on the amount of supplied driving current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">In addition, a partition wall <b>537</b> is formed in the layer under the light-emitting layer <b>538</b> where the pixel electrode <b>532</b> <i>a </i>does not exist to insulate each pixel <b>510</b> in the pixel region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">As a material for forming the pixel electrode <b>532</b> <i>a</i>, a light-transmitting conductive material is preferably used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">As a material for forming the cathode <b>539</b>, a metal having a low work function can be used. Specifically, a metal material having high light-transmitting property such as aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), or barium (Ba) can be used.</div>

When a positive photosensitive organic resin is used as a material for forming the partition wall <b>537</b>, a desired shape of the partition wall can be obtained by performing light exposure and development without a resist mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the pixel used in a light-emitting display device will be described. Note that the method for manufacturing the transistors <b>511</b> and <b>517</b> is almost the same as the method for manufacturing the transistor <b>111</b> in Embodiment <b>1</b>; therefore, the detailed description is omitted here. In accordance with Embodiment <b>1</b>, a first photolithography step using a first photomask is performed to form the gate electrodes <b>522</b> and <b>523</b>, the wiring <b>524</b>, and the semiconductor layer <b>526</b>. Then, after the planarization insulating layer <b>531</b> is formed, a second photolithography step using a second photomask is performed to form the contact holes <b>533</b>.

Note that multi-tone masks are used as the first photomask and the third photomask in a manner similar to that of Embodiment 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">This embodiment differs from Embodiment 1 in that a plurality of transistors is formed in one pixel and contact holes for electrically connecting the plurality of transistors are formed. According to one embodiment of the present invention, even when the number of transistors and the number of contact holes are increased, the transistors and the contact holes can be formed without increasing the number of photomasks. As a result, the transistors can be manufactured using three photomasks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">Next, a fourth photolithography step using a fourth photomask is performed to form the partition wall <b>537</b> for insulating the adjacent pixel electrodes <b>532</b> <i>a </i>and form the light-emitting layer <b>538</b> and the cathode <b>539</b> over the pixel electrode <b>532</b> <i>a</i>. Then, if necessary, sealing is performed to improve the reliability of the light-emitting display device. For example, with the use of a glass substrate as a sealing substrate, the sealing substrate and the substrate <b>501</b> are attached to each other with a sealant, and a dry agent is placed in the closed space formed by the substrate <b>501</b>, the sealing substrate, and the sealant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the light-emitting display device can be manufactured with four photomasks in total. Thus, the number of manufacturing steps of the light-emitting display device can be reduced; accordingly, the light-emitting display device can be provided at low cost with high productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Note that although an example of a bottom-emission light-emitting display device is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is no particular limitation. With the use of a light-transmitting material as the material of the cathode <b>539</b>, a top-emission light-emitting display device can also be manufactured.</div>
