<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to the Figures in more detail, and particularly referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a typical conventional semiconductor structure <b>100</b> which may include a silicon wafer <b>102</b> having a plurality of gate structures, such as gate structures <b>104</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. Adjacent to the gate structure <b>104</b> may be a source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b>. The positions of the source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> may be reversed. Additionally, the source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> may be shared with other gate structures such as gate structures <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. The semiconductor wafer <b>102</b> may be a single crystal structure. In the conventional structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it may be desirable for source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> to be selectively epitaxially grown from the single crystal wafer <b>102</b> so as to maintain the single crystal structure. Source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> may be filled with, for example, silicon germanium. It is noted that source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> have a flat surface and may be slightly overfilled as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or may be flush with the surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The semiconductor structure <b>100</b> may be formed by forming trenches adjacent to the gate structure <b>104</b> and then filling the trenches with, for example, epitaxial silicon germanium, to add a strained component to the semiconductor wafer <b>102</b>. The silicon germanium may be doped or undoped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing process should be contrasted with the conventional way of forming sources and drains by simply implanting a dopant into the semiconductor material adjacent to the gate structure <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, semiconductor structure <b>200</b> is similar to semiconductor structure <b>100</b> except that semiconductor structure <b>200</b> may have a “faceted” source <b>206</b> and drain <b>208</b> adjacent to gate structure <b>204</b>. Again, source <b>206</b> and drain <b>208</b> may be slightly overfilled as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or may be flush with the surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>202</b> (that is, a corner of the facet would be flush with the surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>202</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Faceting of the faceted source <b>206</b> and drain <b>208</b> may be tailored during the selective epitaxial deposition process by adjusting the reactor temperature, pressure, and etchant and precursor flows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Instead of completely filling the trenches in the semiconductor wafer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, the trenches may be partially filled such as bottom only fill, sidewall only fill and conformal fill where the sidewalls and bottom are equally filled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In each of the semiconductor structures <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> there is a capacitance between the gate structures, such as gate structure <b>104</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and gate structure <b>204</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the respective sources and drains, such as source <b>106</b> and drain <b>108</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and source <b>206</b> and drain <b>208</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It would be desirable to be able to reduce the capacitance between the source/drain and the gate structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, there is illustrated a process for forming a first exemplary embodiment of a semiconductor structure <b>300</b>. The semiconductor structure <b>300</b> that is formed is preferably a p-type field effect transistor (PFET).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, there is illustrated in cross-sectional view a semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> having a plurality of gate structures <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>. Each gate structure may include a gate and spacers although the precise structure of the gate structures <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> is not important to the present invention. It should be understood that there will be typically many more such gate structures on a typical semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">It should also be understood that all of the devices to be formed in semiconductor structure <b>300</b> preferably are PFET devices. Semiconductor structure <b>300</b> may also include n-type field effect transistors (NFETs) and in that case, the PFETs may be separated from the NFETs by shallow trench isolation or other means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> may be any semiconductor wafer including a bulk semiconductor wafer or, a semiconductor on insulator (SOI) wafer that may include an active SOI layer of a semiconductor, such as silicon, a semiconductor substrate, and a buried insulator layer, such as an oxide, that separates and electrically isolates the semiconductor substrate from the SOI layer. The semiconductor material making up a bulk semiconductor wafer may be any semiconductor material, including but not limited to, silicon, silicon germanium, germanium, a III-V compound semiconductor, or a II-VI compound semiconductor. Similarly, for an SOI wafer, the active SOI layer may be any semiconductor material, including but not limited to, silicon, silicon germanium, germanium, a III-V compound semiconductor, or a II-VI compound semiconductor. The semiconductor substrate of the SOI wafer also may be any semiconductor material, including but not limited to, silicon, silicon germanium, germanium, a III-V compound semiconductor, or a II-VI compound semiconductor but is usually just silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">It is most preferred that if the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> is a bulk semiconductor wafer, the semiconductor material is silicon and if the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> is an SOI wafer, the semiconductor material in the active SOI layer is silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, trenches <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> have been formed in the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> adjacent to gate structure <b>306</b>. If the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> is an SOI wafer, the trenches <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> typically should not extend past the SOI layer into the buried insulator layer. The trenches <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> may be formed by a conventional process such as reactive ion etching (RIE). The gate structures <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> may be masked off during the RIE process. Such masking is not shown for clarity. After the RIE to form the trenches <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> may undergo a preclean process to remove any RIE residue. Such a preclean process, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, may include sulfuric acid plus peroxide or dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF). There may be an additional preclean process consisting of a plasma-assisted dry cleaning.</div>

For example, the notation {100} is meant to indicate that the crystal plane orientation may be any of the family of (100) planes such as (100), (010), (001), etc. When notations such as {100} or (100) are used herein, these notations shall be deemed to be the Miller indices notations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> may be oriented such that trenches <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> include a bottom surface <b>314</b> that may have a crystal plane orientation such as {100}, and side surfaces <b>316</b> that may have a crystal plane orientation such as {110}. The notation {100} with respect to the bottom surface <b>314</b> is meant to indicate that the crystal plane orientation of the bottom surface <b>314</b> may be any of the family of (100) planes such as (100), (010), (001), etc. Similarly, the notation {110} with respect to the side surfaces <b>316</b> is meant to indicate that the crystal plane orientation of the side surfaces <b>316</b> may be any of the family of (110) planes such as (110), (101), (011), etc. It has been found that the semiconductor wafers having crystal plane orientations such as that just described work well for the exemplary embodiments but it should be understood that semiconductor wafers having other crystal plane orientations are not excluded from the exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> may be placed in an EPI chamber (i.e., a chamber for the growth of epitaxial material) and epitaxial silicon (i.e., not an alloy or compound of silicon) may be grown in trenches <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> by a selective epitaxial process to form source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b>. The terms “epitaxial” and “epitaxially” and similar terms are used herein to refer to the deposition of a crystalline silicon-containing material onto a crystalline substrate in such a way that the deposited layer adopts or follows the lattice constant of the semiconductor wafer. In the exemplary embodiments, the crystalline-containing material and the crystalline substrate are both preferably silicon. The positions of the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> may be reversed depending on the design of the semiconductor structure <b>300</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the present inventors have found that a “reverse facet” or “inverted facet” may be obtained for the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> by selectively depositing epitaxial silicon while doping with boron. By reverse facet or inverted facet, it is meant that the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> are recessed and have angled walls <b>322</b> that extend downwardly and toward the center of the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the angled walls <b>322</b> of the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> may meet in a flat bottom <b>324</b>. Source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> may be slightly overfilled as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> or may be flush with the surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>302</b> (that is, a corner of the facet would be flush with the surface of the semiconductor <b>302</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Process conditions during the selective epitaxial process include a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process in which silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and/or Dichlorosilane (H<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>), and HCl gas for selectivity and a boron-containing precursor such as Diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) gas (other boron-containing precursors may include but not be limited to borontrichloride (BCl3)) may be fed into the epitaxial process reactor plus hydrogen as carrier gas at a pressure of about 2 to 600 torr with 10 to 80 torr being preferred and temperature of about 600 to 850° C. with 650 to 750° C. being preferred. The partial pressure of the boron-containing precursor (such as Diborane) concentration should be relatively high. For example, in a reduced pressure (RP) CVD chamber having a process pressure of about 10 to 80 torr and a carrier gas flow of about 2 to 50 standard liters per minute (SLM), the partial pressure of Diborane may be about 0.1 to 100 mtorr. The resulting boron concentration in the faceted source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> should be about 1×10<sup>19 </sup>to 8×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a doping profile for a source or drain such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Just outside the source or drain, the boron concentration is nil or practically nil. At the edge of the source or drain and continuing toward the center of the source or drain, the boron concentration increases abruptly to the boron concentration indicated above. Such an abrupt discontinuity in the dopant concentration is not observed when the already-deposited semiconductor material is doped by implanting as is conventional in the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As noted above, reverse or inverted facets may be obtained according to the exemplary embodiments. While not wishing to be held to a particular theory, the present inventors believe the combination of a preclean process consisting of a plasma-assisted dry cleaning process and the boron with the silicon in the selective epitaxial deposition process and under the above process conditions causes the boron-doped silicon to grow preferentially from the side walls ({110} plane) and more slowly from the bottom ({100} plane) of the trenches <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. Eventually, growth slows down on the {111} plane orientation which forms the angled walls <b>322</b> of the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b>. The result is the recessed source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> in a reverse or inverted facet orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The plasma-assisted dry cleaning process may include an etchant gas of at least one of nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) or the like. In some embodiments, the etchant gas may nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). The plasma-assisted dry cleaning process may proceed at a temperature of about room temperature to about 30° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The formation of the recessed source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> have the added advantage of decreasing the capacitance between the source <b>318</b> and gate structure <b>306</b> and drain <b>320</b> and gate structure <b>306</b> during contact formation. In addition, there may be greater contact area between the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> and a contact that will eventually be formed to connect the source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b> and the next level of wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the process may be allowed to continue until the angled walls <b>322</b> actually meet so that there is no longer a flat bottom to the recessed source <b>318</b> and drain <b>320</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Boron is a p-type dopant so the exemplary embodiments are most useful for the formation of pFET devices. The present inventors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the exemplary embodiment with boron as the dopant. The exemplary embodiments may be extended to the use of other p-type dopants such as boron fluoride (BF2) or aluminum-, gallium-, indium- or thalium—containing precursors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art having regard to this disclosure that other modifications of the exemplary embodiments beyond those embodiments specifically described here may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
