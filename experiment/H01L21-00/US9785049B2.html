<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for forming a multi-layer film useful as a resist under layer film to be used for fine processing in the manufacturing process of a semiconductor device, etc., and to a patterning process using a multi-layer film formed by the method for forming a multi-layer film.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">In recent years, as LSI (Large-Scale Integrated circuit) progresses toward high integration and high speed, a finer pattern rule is being requested. Under such circumstances, the lithography using a light exposure, which has been currently used as a general technology, is approaching the essential limit of resolution derived from the wavelength of a light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">As the light source for lithography to be used for formation of a resist pattern, g-beam (436 nm) or i-beam (365 nm) of a mercury lamp, KrF excimer laser (248 nm), ArF excimer laser (193 nm), etc., have been widely used, and a double patterning has been investigated for finer patterning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">The double patterning is a technology that is capable of doubling the resolution of a resist, and further facilitate miniaturization of devices. Accompanying with the progress of miniaturization, a dry etching technology and a hard mask material each having high dimensional accuracy have been required. Also, needs for forming deep holes or grooves by dry etching has been heightened in manufacturing a 3-dimensional NAND memory or a capacitor of DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory), etc. Under such a background, a hard mask excellent in etching resistance has been earnestly required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">On the other hand, to prevent a pattern collapse due to shrinkage of the size of a resist pattern, the thickness of the resist film has been thinned, and as a means to prevent the reduction in dry etching resistance due to the film-thinning, a multi-layer resist process has been used. The multi-layer process generally used in this case is a 3-layer (tri-layer) process in which a hydrocarbon film (hydrocarbon under layer film) is formed at a lower layer, an intermediate film containing silicon (silicon-containing intermediate film) is formed thereon, and a resist film is formed thereon. By providing antireflection effects to both of the silicon-containing intermediate film and the hydrocarbon under layer film, high antireflection effect can be obtained. In the age of a liquid immersion lithography in combination with a high NA (Numerical Aperture) lens, incidence angle of light to a substrate becomes shallow, so that reflection of the substrate is increased, and thus, an antireflection film having a high antireflection effect is required. Accordingly, the tri-layer process using a silicon-containing intermediate film and a hydrocarbon under layer film which have excellent antireflection effect was rapidly spread.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">For carrying out the lithography for a fine pattern with a narrow focus margin, it is necessary to flatten the base material. In the case that a hydrocarbon under layer film and a silicon-containing intermediate film are formed by spin coating, there is a merit that the film surface can be flattened by a simple and easy process only of spin coating and baking, by applying a material excellent in embedding characteristics. However, these films formed by spin coating have a problem of insufficient dry etching resistance for double-patterning or digging deep holes or grooves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">Accordingly, a metal series film excellent in dry etching resistance has been investigated, and a hard mask, such as a silicon film and a titanium nitride film, formed by sputtering or CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) has been widely used. However, the hard mask formed by sputtering or CVD cannot flatten unevenness of the base material, so that it is necessary to flatten the film surface by grinding with CMP (Chemical-Mechanical Polishing) after film formation. In addition, sputtering and CVD require special devices, which increase the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">As the metal series film, a material for forming a metal oxide film by spin coating has been proposed, and a method in which a metal hard mask is formed under a photoresist film, a carbon film is formed thereunder, and a pattern is formed by tri-layer process is known (Non-Patent Document 1). Although the metal oxide film has an advantage to have excellent dry etching resistance compared to the silicon oxide film, it shows high absorbance of ArF light, and causes strong reflection from the metal oxide film. It also causes metal contamination of a spin coater when the metal oxide is applied by a spin coater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">In the case of forming the metal oxide film by spin coating, it is necessary to raise the baking temperature after spin coating to 250° C. or higher. At this time, if a usual hydrocarbon film is applied as an under layer film, it is thermally decomposed. Therefore, a hydrocarbon material having high heat resistance is required for the under layer film. As the material, there may be mentioned a novolac resin of fluorene bisnaphthol, and aldehyde condensates of carbazole or fluorenone (see Patent Documents 1 and 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010">It is also feasible that an under layer film with high heat resistance is formed by spin coating, and a hard mask such as a polysilicon hard mask is formed thereon. The polysilicon is a hard mask with excellent etching resistance. Forming a multi-layer film with 5 layers in total including two layers of antireflection films of a hydrocarbon film and a silicon oxide film formed on the polysilicon hard mask as well as a resist film formed on the antireflection films, it is possible to achieve excellent antireflection effect, to make the silicon oxide film thinner, and to have excellent etching selectivity in processing the substrate. This is excellent multi-layer constitution free from a risk to cause metal contamination, which have been generated in a method of forming a metal oxide film. On the other hand, since the polysilicon film is formed by sputtering at a substrate temperature of 500° C. or higher, this method subject the under layer film formed prior to the polysilicon film to be heated to 500° C. or higher. In heating at 500° C. or higher, there increases a risk of generating out gas from the film even if the under layer film can endure a temperature of 500° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0011">In addition, in the tri-layer process, it has been proposed to form a negative pattern by development with an organic solvent. In this case, a margin for subjecting the silicon-containing intermediate film just below the resist to dry etching processing is insufficient since dry etching resistance of the resist film is markedly lowered under the influences both of remaining the film in which the cyclic protective group having etching resistance has been deprotected, and decreasing the film thickness due to the deprotection of the protective group. Thus, it has been investigated to make the silicon-containing intermediate film thin. At present, the film thickness of the silicon-containing intermediate film generally ranges from 30 to 40 nm. This has been determined by the reason that this range enables reflection of a substrate to be minimized, and the balance between the etching rate for transferring the pattern of the resist film and the etching rate for transferring the pattern of the silicon-containing intermediate film to the hydrocarbon film at the lower layer. On the other hand, to deal with insufficiency of dry etching resistance of the resist film, it is necessary to set the thickness of the silicon-containing intermediate film to 10 to 20 nm. However, when the silicon-containing intermediate film is thinned, two problems arise. One is that reflection of the substrate increases, which leads to the reduction in margin of the lithography. The other is that sufficient resistance cannot be secured for processing the hydrocarbon film at the lower layer by dry etching using the pattern of the silicon-containing intermediate film as a mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Also, considering the limit of semiconductor miniaturization, an increased capacity without depending on miniaturization is required in memory devices. In a flash memory, it has been investigated to increase the capacity by using a 3-dimensional memory in which memory cells are vertically laminated. In this case, a hole pattern is formed in the film having dozens of layers being laminated, and a gate electrode is embedded therein to form a transistor. In other words, it is required to form a fine hole by development with an organic solvent as mentioned above, and then perform a dry etching using the same to form a deep hole pattern. Accordingly, such processing requires a hard mask that has excellent etching resistance and is capable of transferring a negative pattern having low etching resistance and of deeply processing the laminated film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">As mentioned above, it is desired to develop a multi-layer film that can reduce reflection of the substrate to form a fine pattern and to process a laminated structure, and allows pattern formation with high dimensional accuracy in dry etching.</div>

In addition, according to the patterning process of the present invention using such a multi-layer film, a pattern may be formed by a 5-layer (penta-layer) process using a photoresist film and the multi-layer film having the above-mentioned characteristics, so that, in particular, even when a negative tone resist pattern developed by an organic solvent which is thin and vulnerable in dry etching resistance is used, the pattern can be transferred with high accuracy. Further, by using a material having high heat resistance to form the under layer film by the spin coating method, the under layer film can endure a high temperature baking treatment when a titanium nitride film or a titanium oxynitride film (inorganic hard mask) is formed thereon. Thus, it is possible to provide a highly-accurate and low-cost patterning process combining an under layer film obtained by the spin coating method and a titanium nitride film or a titanium oxynitride film (inorganic hard mask), which has excellent dry etching resistance.</div>

<heading id="h-0014">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">As mentioned above, the patterning process using a multi-layer resist film that has a tri-layer structure exhibits more excellent pattern transfer precision than methods using a single layer resist film or using an organic antireflection film laid under the resist film, but thinning of the resist film accompanied by the progress of miniaturization and reduction in dry etching resistance of the resist film cause a problem of lowering of pattern transfer precision even when the tri-layer process is employed. Thus, it has been desired to construct a method for forming a multi-layer film that can heighten pattern transfer precision, and a patterning process using the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows reflectance of a silicon substrate for tri-layer process that has a resist film, a silicon oxide film (n value=1.6, k value=0.2) placed under the resist film, and a hydrocarbon film (n value=1.4, k value=0.4) placed under the silicon oxide film, when film thickness of the hydrocarbon film and the silicon oxide film are changed. At this time, liquid immersion lithography with a wavelength of 193 nm and dipole illumination of NA=1.35 as an optical illumination is employed. Also, gradations in the graph show that denser the color is, the lower the reflectance of the substrate is. From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be understood that, in the case of tri-layer process, if the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is in the range of 35 to 60 nm, there exist a black region where the reflectance is 1% or less regardless of the film thickness of the hydrocarbon film, whereas if the silicon oxide film is set to 35 nm or less, reflection of the substrate increases. From these results, it can be understood that reduction of the reflectance and film-thinning of the silicon oxide film cannot be achieved simultaneously in the tri-layer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">In the case of a tri-layer composed of a resist film, a silicon oxide film, and a hydrocarbon film, it is necessary to make reflection of the substrate constant by filling unevenness of the substrate even when the film thickness of the hydrocarbon film is changed. Therefore, a thick layer region at which reflection of the substrate is constant even when the film thickness of the hydrocarbon film is changed is used, and further, a material having high absorption (i.e., having a large k value) is selected so that reflection of the substrate becomes constant. From the viewpoint of suppressing reflection alone, the optimum k value of the hydrocarbon film is 0.2 to 0.3, but according to this value, absorption is not sufficient, and reflection of the substrate increases or decreases depending on the effect of fluctuations in film thickness of the hydrocarbon film. For the above reasons, a material having a k value of 0.4 or more is used for the tri-layer process. However, in this case, if the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is thinned to 20 nm or less, the problem occurs that reflection increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">Also, a resist pattern obtained by negative development has extremely low etching resistance under the influences of thinning the resist film thickness accompanied by the progress of miniaturization, and shrink of the film thickness due to deprotection of a cyclic protective group that improves etching resistance. It has been investigated to make the silicon oxide film just below the resist film thin to transfer the resist pattern having extremely low etching resistance. However, in the case of the tri-layer process, a thinned silicon oxide film causes the increase in reflection of the substrate as mentioned above, so that there is a problem that a margin of lithography is lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows reflectance of a silicon substrate for tetra-layer process that has a resist film, a silicon oxide film (n value=1.6, k value=0.2) placed under the resist film, a titanium nitride film (n value=2.1, k value=1.5) placed under the silicon oxide film, and an under layer film (n value=1.4, k value=0.4; film thickness: 100 nm) placed under the titanium nitride film, when film thicknesses of the silicon oxide film and the titanium nitride film are changed. The titanium nitride film has high n value and k value as well as large reflection. Accordingly, when the film formed thereon is only one layer of the silicon oxide film, it is not possible to suppress the reflection unless the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is 40 nm or more as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This reveals that both of reduction of the reflectance and film-thinning of the silicon oxide film cannot be achieved simultaneously in the tetra-layer process. When the silicon oxide film is thick, the resist pattern thereon is subjected to heavy load in dry etching. In order to reduce the load onto a resist pattern in dry etching, a thinner silicon oxide film is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0045">To solve these problems, the present inventors have focused an attention on pattern formation by a penta-layer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows reflectance of a silicon substrate for penta-layer process that has a resist film, a silicon oxide film (n value=1.6, k value=0.2) placed under the resist film, a hydrocarbon film (n value=1.5 and k value=0.3) placed under the silicon oxide film, a titanium nitride film (n value=2.1, k value=1.5; film thickness 30 nm) placed under the hydrocarbon film, and an under layer film (n value=1.4, k value=0.4; film thickness: 100 nm) placed under the titanium nitride film, when film thicknesses of the hydrocarbon film and the silicon oxide film are changed. The titanium oxide film has an extremely large absorption at a wavelength of 193 nm and a high n value, and exhibits high reflectance. From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be understood that, in the case of the penta-layer process, there exist a region which gives reflection of the substrate of 1% or less even when the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is thinned to about 24 nm. From these results, it can be understood that both of reduction of the reflectance and film-thinning of the silicon oxide film can be achieved simultaneously in the penta-layer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0047">Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows reflectance of the above-mentioned substrate for penta-layer process in which the n value of the hydrocarbon film is heightened (n value=1.6, k value=0.3), and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows reflectance of the above-mentioned substrate for penta-layer process in which the n value of the hydrocarbon film is further heightened (n value=1.7, k value=0.3). From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, it can be understood that if the n value of the hydrocarbon film is heightened in the penta-layer process, it is possible to suppress reflection of the substrate even when the silicon oxide film is further thinned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0048">From the above facts, the present inventors have found that, when embedding and flattening of the substrate is carried out by an under layer film, and then a titanium nitride film or a titanium oxynitride film is formed thereon, light is totally reflected on the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film, but an antireflection film (a hydrocarbon film and a silicon oxide film) applied thereon does not change the reflectance even when the film thickness is changed because the base material has already been flattened, so that a film thickness that gives the exactly minimum reflection can be selected. Also, they have found that selecting a hydrocarbon film material having a high n value allows thinning of the film thickness of the silicon oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0049">Besides, in the conventional patterning process by the tri-layer process, when an amorphous carbon film is formed at a lower layer, and a hard mask that also functions as an antireflection film, such as SiON, is formed thereon, the SiON hard mask shows excellent etching resistance to the amorphous carbon film formed at the lower layer, and the amorphous carbon film also shows excellent dry etching resistance to the substrate to be processed that is positioned thereunder. This is a firm combination in view of dry etching resistance. The formation of the amorphous carbon film is generally performed by CVD method, however, unevenness of the substrate used as a substrate to be processed cannot be flattened by the CVD method, so that it is necessary to plane the surface of the amorphous carbon film by the CMP method to flatten the substrate surface. That is, there arises the problem that the processing cost is increased by applying the CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0050">On the other hand, for forming a flat carbon film surface, spin coating is effective. In this case, a carbon film having a flat surface can be formed by the simple and easy process of applying and baking, so that throughput thereof is high and the cost is low. That is, in the present invention, it is effective to form an under layer film by spin coating for embedding and flattening of the substrate by the under layer film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0051">Further, as mentioned above, the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film is formed on the under layer film by sputtering method or a CVD method, and raising the substrate temperature to 300° C. or higher in the film formation, whereby a firm titanium nitride film or titanium oxynitride film is formed. Accordingly, the coating type under layer film that is used as a base material of the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film in the present invention requires high heat resistance of 300° C. or higher. The present inventors have conceived to use a resin that has a repeating unit containing a specific fluorene structure or a compound that contains a specific fluorene structure as the under layer film material having such a high heat resistance, thereby brought the present invention completion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0052">That is, the present invention is a method for forming a multi-layer film on a substrate, comprising the steps of:</div>

Illustrative examples of the aromatic compounds substituted by an alcohol such as a hydroxymethyl group include benzene-dimethanol, benzenetrimethanol, toluenedimethanol, ethylbenzenedimethanol, propylbenzenedimethanol, butylbenzenedimethanol, cyclohexylbenzenedimethanol, xylenedimethanol, mesitylenedimethanol, naphthalene-dimethanol, naphthalenetrimethanol, methylnaphthalene-dimethanol, ethylnaphthalenedimethanol, propylnaphthalene-dimethanol, butylnaphthalenedimethanol, dimethylnaphthalenedimethanol, anthracenedimethanol, phenanthrenedimethanol, pyrenedimethanol, pentacene-dimethanol, fluorenedimethanol, biphenyldimethanol, bisnaphthalenedimethanol, fluoranthenedimethanol, indenedimethanol, acenaphthylenedimethanol, acephenanthrylenedimethanol, and aceanthrylenedimethanol. The aromatic compounds substituted by an alkoxymethyl group are compounds in which the hydroxymethyl group of the above-mentioned compounds is substituted by an alkoxymethyl group, and the aromatic compounds substituted by a halomethyl group are compounds in which the hydroxymethyl group of the above-mentioned compounds is substituted by a halomethyl group. In this case, the aldehyde is not necessarily required in the co-condensation reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0082">The molecular weight of the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (1) or (2) containing a fluorene structure is preferably a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 1,000 to 30,000, particularly preferably 2,000 to 20,000 in terms of polystyrene. The molecular weight distribution thereof is preferably in the range of 1.2 to 7, and those in which a monomer component, an oligomer component, or a low molecular weight component having a molecular weight (Mw) of 1,000 or less has cut to narrow the molecular weight distribution are preferred since crosslinking efficiency becomes high, and volatile components during baking is suppressed whereby contamination in the vicinity of the baking cup can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0083">It is possible to blend other polymer into the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (1) in which a fluorene structure is contained, the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (2) in which a fluorene structure is contained, and the compound shown by the general formula (3) in which a fluorene structure is contained. The polymer for blend preferably serves to improve film-formability in spin coating or embedding characteristics of the stepped substrate by mixing the polymer and/or the compound containing fluorene structure. More specifically, a polymer capable of reducing the softening point, such as polyethylene glycol, polypropyrene glycol, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polyacetal, and polyvinyl ether, is suitable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0084">In addition, a material having high carbon density and having high etching resistance may be blended. As examples of the material, there may be mentioned the same materials as exemplified for the hydrocarbon film material as described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0085">The formulation amount of the polymer for blend may be 0 to 1,000 parts by mass, preferably 0 to 500 parts by mass based on total 100 parts by mass of the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (1) in which a fluorene structure is contained, the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (2) in which a fluorene structure is contained, and the compound shown by the general formula (3) in which a fluorene structure is contained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0086">Also, to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, a monomer component to be used for condensation of the resin containing a fluorene structure shown by the general formula (1) or (2) may be added. Addition of the monomer component has a merit of improving embedding characteristics without changing optical constant. The adding amount thereof is preferably 0 to 1,000 parts by mass, more preferably 0 to 500 parts by mass based on total 100 parts by mass of the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (1) in which a fluorene structure is contained, the resin having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (2) in which a fluorene structure is contained, and the compound shown by the general formula (3) in which a fluorene structure is contained. The adding amount can be appropriately adjusted while observing the embedding characteristics. If the adding amount of the monomer component is too much, it becomes outgas during baking to generate particles, so that a baking furnace is contaminated in some cases. Thus, when the monomer component is added, it is preferred to keep the adding amount minimum which can ensure the embedding characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0087">Conventionally, it has been required in the resist under layer film served as an antireflection film that there is no intermixing with the resist intermediate layer film containing silicon and the resist upper layer film formed on the resist under layer film, and that there is no diffusion of the low molecule component to the resist upper layer film and the resist intermediate layer film (Proc. SPIE Vol. 2195, p 225-229 (1994)). To prevent these problems, there has generally been employed a method in which the material is thermally crosslinked by baking after spin coating of the antireflection film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0088">Therefore, in the present invention, when a crosslinking agent is added as a component of the under layer film material, a crosslinkable substituent may be introduced into the polymer (resin) or the compound used as the material. Even when the crosslinking agent is not added, it is possible to cure the under layer film material containing one or more species selected from the resins having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (1) in which a fluorene structure is contained, the resins having a repeating unit shown by the general formula (2) in which a fluorene structure is contained, and the compounds shown by the general formula (3) in which a fluorene structure is contained by heating at 300° C. or higher. Particularly, in the case of a novolac resin having a fluorene structure, the resin can be crosslinked by heating at 300° C. or higher according to the reaction mechanism mentioned later. Incidentally, in the material for forming a multi-layer film such as a silicon oxide film material and a hydrocarbon film material, which will be described later, a crosslinkable substituent may be introduced into the polymer (resin) or the compound used as the material when a crosslinking agent is added.</div>
<heading id="h-0019">Additives</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0089">A crosslinking agent may be added to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention. The crosslinking agent may be specifically exemplified by the materials disclosed in paragraphs (0055) to (0060) of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-199653.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0090">Also, to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, an acid generator for further promoting the crosslinking reaction by heat can be added. As the acid generator, there is a material which generates an acid by heat decomposition or a material which generates an acid by photoirradiation, and either of which may be added. The acid generator may be specifically exemplified by the materials disclosed in paragraphs (0061) to (0085) of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-199653.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0091">Further, to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, a basic compound for improving preservation stability may be added. The basic compound acts as a quencher to an acid for preventing the crosslinking reaction from promoting by an acid generated from the acid generator with a minor amount. Such a basic compound may be specifically exemplified by the materials disclosed in paragraphs (0086) to (0090) of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-199653.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0092">Moreover, to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, a solvent such as an organic solvent and water is preferably added. The usable organic solvent is not particularly limited so long as it can dissolve the resin or the compound, the acid generator, the crosslinking agent, and other additives to be used in the material. There may be specifically mentioned the solvents disclosed in paragraphs (0091) to (0092) of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-199653.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0093">Furthermore, to the under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, a surfactant may be added for improving applicability by spin coating. The surfactant may be specifically exemplified by the materials disclosed in paragraphs (0165) to (0166) of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-111103.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0094">These additives can also be added to a silicon oxide film material, a hydrocarbon film material, etc., which will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0095">The under layer film material to be used in the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention is applied onto a substrate to be processed by the spin coating method, etc., similarly to a photoresist film material mentioned later. By using the spin coating method, good embedding characteristics can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0096">Further, after spin coating, baking is carried out to evaporate the solvent to promote the crosslinking reaction. The baking is carried out at a temperature of 300° C. or higher and 800° C. or lower, preferably 350° C. or higher and 700° C. or lower, much more preferably 400° C. or higher and 600° C. or lower for 10 to 4,000 seconds, preferably 10 to 3,000 seconds. Since the temperature is in a range of 300° C. to 800° C. when the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film is formed on the under layer film, the under layer film have to be baked previously at the foregoing temperature so as not to generate outgas from the under layer film in forming the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film. By baking the under layer film at ultrahigh temperature, etching resistance thereof can be enhanced when the substrate to be processed thereunder is subjected to dry etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0097">The novolac resin generates phenoxy radicals by heating, and methylene groups of the novolac bonds are activated to crosslink the methylene groups to each other. Since this reaction is a radical reaction, no releasing molecule generates, so that no film shrinkage by crosslinking occurs if a material having high heat resistance is used. If oxygen is contained during baking, crosslinking due to oxidative coupling also proceeds. For promoting crosslinking by the oxidative coupling, baking in the atmosphere may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0098">Baking may be carried out on a hot plate, or may be carried out in a furnace. When the furnace is used, a large amount of wafers can be treated at once, so that high throughput can be obtained. Baking may be carried out in the atmosphere, or in an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, and argon gas. When baking is carried out in the inert gas, shrinkage amount of the film can be reduced. In addition, when baking is carried out in the inert gas, oxidation can be prevented, so that the increase in absorption and the decrease in etching resistance can also be prevented. Baking in the inert gas is preferably carried out at baking after crosslinking. Also, for preventing oxidation, oxygen concentration is preferably controlled. The oxygen concentration in the inert gas is preferably 1,000 ppm or less, more preferably 100 ppm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0099">The baking can be divided into multiple times. For example, it is possible to perform the first baking at a temperature of 100 to 300° C. on a hot plate, and to perform the second baking at 300 to 800° C. in a furnace. In this method, evaporation of the solvent and the crosslinking are carried out in the first baking, and pre-baking for forming a titanium nitride film is carried out in the second baking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0100">Also, up to now, a fluorocarbon series gas has been used in dry etching of the substrate to be processed, and this sometimes causes a phenomenon of bending of a line of the under layer film after dry etching. This bending of the line is considered to be caused by the reason that the under layer film is fluorinated during dry etching whereby the volume thereof is increased. To the contrary, when an under layer film which had been subjected to high temperature baking is used as in the present invention, the under layer film becomes dense and rigid, so that there is a merit that bending of the line of the under layer film after dry etching difficulty occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0101">Incidentally, the thickness of the under layer film is appropriately selected, and is preferably set to 30 to 20,000 nm, more preferably 50 to 15,000 nm, further preferably 80 to 10,000 nm.</div>
<heading id="h-0020">Step (ii)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0102">In the step (ii) of the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention, a titanium nitride film or a titanium oxynitride film is formed onto the under layer film formed as described above.</div>
<heading id="h-0021">Titanium Nitride Film or Titanium Oxynitride Film</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0103">It is preferable that the formation of the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film be carried out by a sputtering method or a CVD method. The titanium nitride film can be formed by the same method as the sputtering method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H11-026401 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2015-151575, or the CVD method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H08-246152. The titanium oxynitride film can be formed by the same method as the sputtering method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H11-172414.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0104">In order to form a high density film, the substrate have to be heated to 300° C. or higher in forming the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film. In order to suppress generation of outgas from the under layer film in forming the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film, the substrate with the under layer film being previously formed thereon have to be baked at the temperature for forming the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film or higher (i.e., 300° C. or higher). Accordingly, the under layer film formed in the step (i) needs heat resistance to endure such a temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0105">The film thickness of the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film is preferably 3 to 100 nm, more preferably 5 to 50 nm. The titanium nitride film and the titanium oxynitride film have excellent dry etching resistance, and therefore they do not need to be formed thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0106">Onto the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film, a hydrocarbon film for usual tri-layer process is formed (step (iii)), a silicon oxide film is formed thereon (step (iv)), and a photoresist film is further formed thereon (step (A) of the patterning process mentioned later). Exposure light is reflected on the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film, and does not reach to the under layer film under the same. Reflection can be suppressed by controlling a phase and an absorption of the two layers of the hydrocarbon film and the silicon oxide film on the titanium nitride film or the titanium oxynitride film as antireflection films. If the n value of the refractive index of the hydrocarbon film is close to the n value of the photoresist film, reflection of the substrate can be made 1% or less even when the film thickness of the silicon oxide film is 20 nm or less. As described above, one of the objects of the present invention is to accomplish both of reducing reflectance of the substrate and thinning the silicon oxide film. Accordingly, it is important to select a material having a high n value for the hydrocarbon film under the silicon oxide film to make the silicon oxide film just below the photoresist film a thin film having a film thickness of 20 nm or less.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0124">Next, as the step (D), dry etching is carried out using the silicon oxide film <b>6</b> to which the pattern has been transferred as a mask to transfer the pattern to the hydrocarbon film <b>5</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(D)</figref>). As the etching gas to be used in the step (D), one or more gases selected from an oxygen gas, a hydrogen gas, an ammonia gas, a carbon dioxide gas, a carbon monoxide gas, and a sulfur dioxide gas are suitable. Also, the dry etching of the step (D) may be an oxygen plasma etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0125">Next, as the step (E), dry etching is carried out using the hydrocarbon film <b>5</b> to which the pattern has been transferred as a mask to transfer the pattern to the titanium nitride film <b>4</b> (or the titanium oxynitride film) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(E)</figref>).

As the etching gas to be used in the step (G), when the layer to be processed <b>2</b> is SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, or a silica series low dielectric constant insulating film, an etching gas mainly composed of a fluorocarbon series gas is suitable, and when the layer to be processed <b>2</b> is p-Si, Al, or W, an etching gas mainly composed of a chlorine series or bromine series gas is suitable. Incidentally, in the present invention, the titanium nitride film <b>4</b> (or the titanium oxynitride film) and the under layer film <b>3</b> are films both having resistance to the etching gas for the layer to be processed <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0128">According to the patterning process of the present invention as explained above, a pattern is formed by a 5-layer (penta-layer) process using a photoresist film and a multi-layer film having optimum n value and k value, embedding characteristics as an antireflection film, and excellent etching resistance, so that, in particular, even when a negative tone resist pattern developed by an organic solvent which is thin and vulnerable in dry etching resistance is used, the pattern can be transferred with high accuracy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0208">As shown in Table 7, in Examples 1 to 13, in which the pattern was formed by the penta-layer process using the multi-layer film formed by the method for forming a multi-layer film of the present invention as a resist under layer film, a pattern having a cross sectional shape of rectangular could be obtained. In Examples 1 to 13, as shown in Table 5, a titanium oxide film was formed on the under layer film that causes little reduction of the film thickness even after baking at a high temperature of 350° C. or 450° C., and the hydrocarbon film and the silicon oxide film having refractive indexes (antireflection effect) as shown in Table 6 were formed thereon. According to this constitution, light is totally reflected on the titanium nitride film, and substrate reflection can be reduced by two-layered antireflection film composed of the hydrocarbon film and the silicon oxide film formed thereon. In addition, since the substrate reflection can be suppressed even when the film thickness of the silicon oxide film just below the resist is thinned, the resist pattern can be smoothly transferred by dry etching to the silicon oxide film. Further, the shape of the pattern of the substrate to be processed as the base material after dry etching becomes good because of excellent dry etching resistance of the titanium nitride film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0209">On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1, in which Comparative UDL-1 was used as the under layer film material, a cross sectional shape of the pattern was tapered after dry etching of the substrate to be processed as shown in Table 7. Also, in Comparative Example 2, in which neither the titanium nitride film nor the hydrocarbon film had been formed (tri-layer process), pattern collapse occurred as shown in Table V. In Comparative Example 3, in which the hydrocarbon film had not been formed (tetra-layer process), since it had a large reflection from the base material and insufficient selectivity in dry etching of the titanium nitride film by using the silicon oxide film, the pattern became tapered shape finally after the dry etching of the substrate to be processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0210">From the results as mentioned above, it has revealed that formation of the pattern by the penta-layer process using the multi-layer film formed by the inventive method for forming a multi-layer film achieves excellent antireflection effect than the conventional tri-layer process or tetra-layer process and excellent selectivity of dry etching, and can form a pattern with good shape thereby.</div>
