<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Many conventional three dimensional NAND memories store charge in silicon nitride charge storage dielectric layers. The conventional devices suffer from slow erase times, poor data retention and charge spreading. The inventors have realized that low work function conducting floating gates provide better performance than charge storage silicon nitride dielectric layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors have discovered that the deposition of continuous or discontinuous charge storage layers may be advantageously carried out with atomic layer deposition (ALD). The ALD process is inherently selective due to surface sensitivity. Further, good results are easier to achieve with the ALD process versus chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, which requires fine tuning of gas flows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the self-limiting nature of ALD allows more accurate and reproducible deposition than CVD. Additionally, the ALD process is shown to be able to deposit discrete or continuous films. Therefore, nanoparticle floating gates can be deposited via ALD on vertical surfaces and are further advantageous because they give better endurance and data retention than continuous charge storage films. In addition, the ALD methods discussed below are shown to be selective on oxide/poly/oxide/poly (OPOP) and oxide/nitride/oxide/nitride (ONON) structures unlike prior art methods. Furthermore, ALD deposition thickness is largely insensitive to wafer temperature, unlike CVD which can be very temperature sensitive. Since the charge storage layers (e.g., floating gate layers) are relatively thin, if there is a drift or non-uniformity in temperature of the deposition surfaces, then this would translate to large changes in floating gate thickness if CVD is used to deposit the floating gates, but not if ALD is used to deposit the floating gates. As discussed in more detail below, selectivity of floating gate deposition on polysilicon or nitride in both ONON and OPOP stacks are demonstrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A monolithic three dimensional memory array is one in which multiple memory levels are formed above a single substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer, with no intervening substrates. The term “monolithic” means that layers of each level of the array are directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. In contrast, two dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a non-monolithic memory device. For example, non-monolithic stacked memories have been constructed by forming memory levels on separate substrates and adhering the memory levels atop each other, as in Leedy, U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,167, titled “Three Dimensional Structure Memory.” The substrates may be thinned or removed from the memory levels before bonding, but as the memory levels are initially formed over separate substrates, such memories are not true monolithic three dimensional memory arrays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the monolithic three dimensional NAND string <b>180</b> comprises a semiconductor channel <b>1</b> having at least one end portion extending substantially perpendicular to a major surface <b>100</b> <i>a </i>of a substrate <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 2A and 3B</figref>. “Substantially perpendicular to” (or “substantially parallel to”) means within 0-10°.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a floating gate material is selectively deposited on the exposed surfaces (e.g. edge surfaces) of the second material layers <b>122</b> exposed in the openings <b>81</b> to form discrete charge storage regions <b>9</b>, such as floating gates.

One or more RuO<sub>2 </sub>monolayers may be formed using atomic layer deposition.

That is, the more hydrophilic the surface, the lower contact angle. Further, a lower contact angle may result in denser films (i.e. denser floating gate segments <b>9</b>). However, the difference in hydrophobicity may be just one contributing factor in the above described selective deposition. For example, without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that differences in the ability of a given surface to initiate catalytic reduction may be another contributing factor in the above described selective deposition.

The thermal oxidation is preferably performed in an atmosphere containing only water vapor (instead of oxygen gas, O<sub>2</sub>) as the oxidant, since H<sub>2</sub>O generally forms the desired, non-volatile RuO<sub>2</sub>, while O<sub>2 </sub>forms undesirable, volatile RuO<sub>4 </sub>after reacting with the Ru floating gate. Thus, the benefit of using water vapor rather than oxygen gas as a polysilicon oxidant is that water vapor is less likely to form the volatile RuO<sub>4 </sub>after reacting with Ru. The volatile RuO<sub>4 </sub>will immediately get removed from the structure and is therefore not desirable. In contrast, RuO<sub>2 </sub>is non-volatile and stable and will continue to function as a floating gate. Therefore, it is preferred to avoid using oxygen gas for oxidizing polysilicon and all oxygen gas should be removed from the oxidizing ambient to the extent possible (e.g., a trace amount of oxygen gas may still remain if it is not possible to remove it).</div>
