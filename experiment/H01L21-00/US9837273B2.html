<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA210602542">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of forming fine patterns of semiconductor devices is disclosed. The method comprises forming a hard mask layer on an etch target, which includes first and second regions. The hard mask layer may further have first and second preliminary mask patterns formed on the same. Furthermore, a spacer layer may be formed on the first and second preliminary mask patterns. The spacer layer and the first and second preliminary mask patterns may be partially removed to form first and second spacers on sidewalls of the first and second preliminary mask patterns, respectively. The second spacer in the second region may have a top surface higher than a top surface of the first spacer in the first region. The height differences between the spacers allow forming of first and second patterns in the first and second regions, and thereby forming fine patterns of semiconductor devices.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Various example embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some example embodiments are shown. Inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and fully convey the scope of example embodiments of inventive concepts to those ordinary skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference characters and/or numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description may not be repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being โon,โ โconnected toโ or โcoupled toโ another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being โdirectly on,โ โdirectly connected toโ or โdirectly coupled toโ another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., โbetweenโ versus โdirectly between,โ โadjacentโ versus โdirectly adjacent,โ โonโ versus โdirectly onโ). As used herein, the term โand/orโ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be understood that, although the terms โfirst,โ โsecond,โ โthird,โ โfourth,โ etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections. These elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present inventive concept.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Spatially relative terms, such as โbeneath,โ โbelow,โ โlower,โ โabove,โ โupperโ and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as โbelowโ or โbeneathโ other elements or features would then be oriented โaboveโ the other elements or features. Thus, the example term โbelowโ can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present inventive concept. As used herein, the singular forms โa,โ โanโ and โtheโ are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms โcomprisesโ and/or โcomprising,โ when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of example embodiments (and intermediate structures). As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of inventive concepts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this inventive concept belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</div>
