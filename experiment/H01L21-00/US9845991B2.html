<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-240639, filed on Oct. 31, 2012, in the Japan Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a heat treatment apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In manufacturing semiconductor devices, various processes are used to heat treat an object to be processed, for example, a semiconductor wafer. The heat treatment includes oxidation, diffusion, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and annealing. For example, a vertical heat treatment apparatus may be used to heat treat a plurality of wafers at one time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the vertical heat treatment apparatus includes a reaction tube provided in a heat treatment furnace and a lid installed to be vertically movable to open and close a furnace opening of the reaction tube. The furnace opening of the reaction tube is sealed by the lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the reaction tube is made of quartz, and the lid is made of metal. An O-ring that protrudes from the lid is brought into contact with the reaction tube. When the quartz reaction tube is sealed by the metal lid, a gap is defined between the quartz reaction tube and the metal lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In another arrangement, a metal outer lid part supports an inner lid. The inner lid includes a quartz inner lid part positioned near a reaction tube. An O-ring is located between the quartz inner lid part and the reaction tube which can be made of quartz. When the reaction tube is sealed by the quartz inner lid part, the reaction tube is brought into contact with the lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In the vertical heat treatment apparatus, when the furnace opening of the reaction tube is sealed by the lid as described above, a bottom flange of the reaction tube is sealed by the lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since among the reaction tube and the lid, at least the reaction tube is made of quartz, when the lid is brought into contact with the bottom flange of the reaction tube, quartz particles may be generated as they are used more frequently. Thus, such quartz particles may sometimes be introduced into the reaction tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, if there is a gap between the reaction tube and the lid to prevent the reaction tube from being brought into contact with the lid, a corrosive gas such as a cleaning gas may be introduced through the gap, thereby corroding other metal parts. Further, even though an inert gas supply unit is provided to prevent the corrosive gas from being introduced through the gap, when a sufficient gap is not formed because the amount of deformation of a sealing member is mis-calculated, a reverse diffusion of the corrosive gas occurs, thus corroding the other metal parts.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure provides a heat treatment apparatus which is capable of preventing a reaction tube from being directly brought into contact with a lid and preventing a sealing member from being damaged, when a furnace opening of the reaction tube is sealed by the lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, provided is a heat treatment apparatus, which includes: a cylindrical quartz reaction tube having a furnace opening and a bottom flange at a lower portion thereof; a flange holding part configured to hold the bottom flange of the reaction tube; and a lid including a metal lid and a quartz lid supported by the metal lid, the quartz lid being configured to close the furnace opening of the reaction tube. The quartz lid is fixed onto the metal lid by a support ring. The support ring is brought into contact with a bottom surface of the flange holding part so that a gap is defined between the quartz lid and the bottom flange. A sealing member is arranged outward from the gap in a radial direction.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A plurality of gas introduction pipes <b>9</b> through which a processing gas or an inert gas for purging is introduced into the reaction tube <b>4</b>, is located in the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>. Herein, the plurality of gas introduction pipes <b>9</b> is shown as one for the sake of simplicity. The gas introduction pipes <b>9</b> are connected to respective pipes of a gas supply system (not shown). In addition, a top portion of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is gradually decreased in diameter so as to form an exhaust port <b>10</b>. The exhaust port <b>10</b> is connected to a pipe of an exhaust system equipped with a vacuum pump or a pressure control valve, which is capable of adjusting an internal pressure of the reaction tube <b>4</b>. These components are not shown in drawings. Both the base plate <b>8</b> and the flange holding part <b>7</b> are made of metal, for example, a SUS metal. Among these, the flange holding part <b>7</b> holds the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A lower portion of the heat treatment furnace <b>2</b> corresponds to a working area (loading area) <b>12</b> through which a heat treatment boat <b>16</b> (which will be described later) mounted on the lid <b>5</b> is loaded into or unloaded from the reaction tube <b>4</b>, or wafers W are transferred to the boat <b>16</b>. The working area <b>12</b> is provided with an elevation mechanism <b>13</b> configured to vertically move the lid <b>5</b> so as to load or unload the boat <b>16</b> into or from the reaction tube <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The lid <b>5</b> includes a lid <b>5</b>C made of metal, e.g., a SUS metal, and a lid <b>5</b>B made of quartz. The quartz lid <b>5</b>B is supported by the metal lid <b>5</b>C and is configured to seal (or close) the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b>. The lid <b>5</b>, which is provided with the metal lid <b>5</b>C and the quartz lid <b>5</b>B, is held by a holding plate <b>15</b> through a plurality of buffer mechanisms <b>14</b>. Herein, the plurality of buffer mechanisms <b>14</b> is shown as one for the sake of simplicity. The holding plate <b>15</b> is connected to the elevation mechanism <b>13</b>. The quartz lid <b>5</b>B of the lid <b>5</b> is configured to close the furnace opening <b>3</b>. A rotation mechanism <b>26</b> having a rotation shaft <b>27</b> configured to rotate the boat <b>16</b> is installed in a lower central portion of the lid <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Next, a configuration in which the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b> will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The boat <b>16</b>, which is made of, e.g., quartz, includes a boat main body <b>17</b> and a single leg part <b>18</b> configured to support the boat main body <b>17</b>. The boat main body <b>17</b> is configured to horizontally support a plurality of (e.g., 75 to 100) wafers W having a large diameter (e.g., 300 mm) at certain vertical intervals in multiple stages. Both the boat main body <b>17</b> and the single leg portion <b>18</b> are integrated together. In addition, the single leg part <b>18</b> of the boat <b>16</b> is connected to the rotation shaft <b>27</b> which rotates the wafers W in their circumferential direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The boat main body <b>17</b> includes a plurality of pillars <b>24</b> which is installed between a bottom plate <b>22</b> and a ceiling plate <b>23</b>. The pillars <b>24</b> and the bottom plate <b>22</b> and the ceiling plate <b>23</b> are integrally bonded by, e.g., welding. The pillars <b>24</b> are disposed at certain intervals along the circumferential direction to surround the wafers W. In the boat <b>16</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the left side in which none the pillars <b>24</b> are installed is used as an opening through which the wafers W are transferred by a transfer mechanism (not shown). A plurality of groves <b>25</b> by which the plurality of the wafers W is held in multiple stages, is formed in each of the pillars <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the size of the single leg portion <b>18</b> falls within a range of 30 to 50 mm in outer diameter and a range of 250 to 350 mm in height, including that of a lower flange <b>19</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The rotation mechanism <b>26</b> includes the rotation shaft <b>27</b> described above and a cylindrical housing <b>28</b>. The housing <b>28</b> is integrally installed with the lid <b>5</b> at the lower central portion of the lid <b>5</b> so as to rotatably support the rotation shaft <b>27</b>. A cylindrical rotation body (not shown) having a bottom is rotatably installed at a lower periphery of the housing <b>28</b>. A rotation axis of the rotation body is coaxially mounted at the axial center of the rotation mechanism <b>26</b>. The portion of the rotation axis that protrudes from the bottom center of the rotation body is air-tightly inserted into the housing <b>28</b> through a sealing member such as an O-ring or a magnetic fluid seal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The rotation body is connected to a motor used as a rotation drive unit by a belt (not shown) so that the rotation axis is driven. A shaft hole <b>34</b> through which the rotation shaft <b>27</b> is passed is formed in the central portion of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B of the lid <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a furnace opening heating mechanism <b>62</b> used as a furnace opening heat retaining means is fixed onto the quartz lid <b>5</b>B of the lid <b>5</b>. The furnace opening heating mechanism <b>62</b> mainly includes a plurality of pillars <b>64</b> which is installed upright on an upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B at certain intervals in its circumferential direction, a plate-shaped heating resistor <b>65</b> which is installed horizontally over upper ends of the pillars <b>64</b>, a plurality of (e.g., two) heat shield plates <b>66</b> which is installed over the pillars <b>64</b> at certain intervals below the heating resistor <b>65</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The pillars <b>64</b> and the heat shield plates <b>66</b> are made of, e.g., quartz. Through holes <b>67</b> through which the single leg portion <b>18</b> including the lower flange <b>19</b> of the boat <b>16</b> is passed, are formed in the heating resistor <b>65</b> and the heat shield plates <b>66</b>. In addition, a pipe <b>68</b> into which a cable configured to supply electric power to the heating resistor <b>65</b> is inserted is installed on the holding plate <b>15</b> in such a manner that the pipe <b>68</b> air-tightly penetrates the lid <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, a configuration in which the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the lid <b>5</b> includes the metal lid <b>5</b>C and the quartz lid <b>5</b>B which is supported by the metal lid <b>5</b>C. The quartz lid <b>5</b>B closes (or seals) the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, an installation structure of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the metal lid <b>5</b>C constituting the lid <b>5</b> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">An annular concave portion <b>80</b>, which is more inwardly concave than a peripheral portion of a lower opening end of the reaction tube <b>4</b>, is formed in an upper portion (upper half) of an outer periphery of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B. A lower portion (lower half) of the outer periphery of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B constitutes a flange portion <b>81</b>. A metal support ring <b>70</b>, which is positioned on the annular concave portion <b>80</b> to hold the flange portion <b>81</b> of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B, is arranged in the metal lid <b>5</b>C. A sealing member <b>77</b>, which is brought into contact with a bottom surface of the lower opening end of the reaction tube <b>4</b>, is disposed on an upper surface of the support ring <b>70</b>. In addition, a coolant path (e.g., cooling water path) <b>70</b> <i>a </i>for use in cooling the sealing member <b>77</b> is formed inside the support ring <b>70</b>. Thus, the sealing member <b>77</b> is efficiently cooled by water flowing through the coolant path <b>70</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The support ring <b>70</b> is of an approximately L-shape (with vertical and horizontal portions) in a vertical cross section and is also formed in an annular (ring) shape to cover (surround) the flange portion <b>81</b>. The support ring <b>70</b> is detachably fixed onto the metal lid <b>5</b>C by a plurality of screws <b>71</b> while holding the flange portion <b>81</b>. An annular holding groove <b>83</b> for holding the sealing member <b>77</b> is formed in a cover ring <b>75</b> of the support ring <b>70</b>. According to the vertical heat treatment apparatus configured as above, it is possible to prevent the lid <b>5</b> from being corroded and obtain improvement in durability of the sealing member <b>77</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment, the plurality of screws <b>71</b> are mounted in the support ring <b>70</b> along the circumferential direction while penetrating the support ring <b>70</b> and the metal lid <b>5</b>C. Further, the support ring <b>70</b> is configured to press the quartz lid <b>5</b>B against the metal lid <b>5</b>C at the outer periphery (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, screws <b>72</b> may be mounted only inside the support ring <b>70</b> without reaching the metal lid <b>5</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">When the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b>, the support ring <b>70</b> is brought into contact with a bottom surface of the flange holding part <b>7</b> through a buffering member <b>73</b> made of polyimide, which is arranged on top sides of the screws <b>71</b> (or <b>72</b>). A gap G is defined between the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The sealing member <b>77</b> is of an approximately Q-shape in a vertical cross section and is fixed by pressing its lip portion onto the support ring <b>70</b> by the cover ring <b>75</b>. The cover ring <b>75</b> is fixed to the support ring <b>70</b> by the screws <b>71</b> (or <b>72</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">A circumferential groove <b>76</b> for blocking heat which is radiated outward from the central portion of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B along the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B in a radial direction, is formed on the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B in a side of the sealing member <b>77</b> facing the central portion of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B in the radial direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, a circumferential protrusion <b>78</b> is formed in the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B to protrude outside the circumferential groove <b>76</b> in the radial direction. The gap G which is defined between the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>, is positioned above the circumferential protrusion <b>78</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the sealing member <b>77</b> arranged in the quartz lid <b>5</b>B is heated by the internal heat of the reaction tube <b>4</b> which is radiated along the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B. In this embodiment, as described above, the circumferential groove <b>76</b> is formed in the quartz lid <b>5</b>B so that the transition of the internal heat from the central portion of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B toward the sealing member <b>77</b> is prevented. Further, it is possible to more securely prevent the heating of the sealing member <b>77</b> by passing the cooling water through the coolant path <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the support ring <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, an operation of the heat processing apparatus configured as above will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">First, in the working area <b>12</b>, the wafers W are transferred to the boat <b>16</b> disposed on the lid <b>5</b>. Subsequently, the lid <b>5</b> is moved upward by the elevation mechanism <b>13</b> until the lid <b>5</b> is brought into contact with the lower opening end of the furnace opening <b>3</b>. Thus, the furnace opening <b>3</b> is closed (sealed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Simultaneously, the rotation body is rotated by the motor. With the rotation of the rotation body, the rotation shaft <b>27</b> is rotated so that the boat <b>16</b> is slowly rotated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">When the furnace opening <b>3</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b>, the buffering member <b>73</b> arranged in the support ring <b>70</b> is brought into contact with the bottom surface of the flange holding part <b>7</b> so that the gap G is defined between the circumferential protrusion <b>78</b> of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">With this configuration, even when the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b>, the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>made of quartz are not directly brought into contact with each other. Thus, it is possible to prevent quartz particles, which are generated when the quartz lid <b>5</b>B is brought into contact with the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, from being generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, since the processing gas in the reaction tube <b>4</b> is confined by the sealing member <b>77</b> installed outside the circumferential protrusion <b>78</b> in the radial direction, the processing gas does not leak. In addition, even when a highly corrosive cleaning gas flows, the support ring <b>70</b> does not corrode. Further, since the sealing member <b>77</b> has an approximate Q-shape cross section and is configured so that the lip portion is fixed by the covering ring <b>75</b>, the sealing member <b>77</b> can be positioned outside the quartz lid <b>5</b>B, i.e., a zone lightly affected by heat. Further, when the lid <b>5</b> is moved upward, the sealing member <b>77</b> is stably adhered onto the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, thus preventing the sealing member <b>77</b> from being displaced from the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the course of the heat treatment for the wafers W, the internal heat of the reaction tube <b>4</b> radiates outward from the central portion of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B in the radial direction along the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B. In this embodiment, the circumferential groove <b>76</b> is formed in the quartz lid <b>5</b>B inward from the circumferential protrusion <b>78</b> (facing the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b>) in the radial direction. This prevents the internal heat of the reaction tube <b>4</b> from being radiated toward the sealing member <b>77</b>. In addition, in this embodiment, the cooling water flows through the coolant path <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the support ring <b>70</b>, thus preventing the sealing member <b>77</b> from being deteriorated by the heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, according to the above embodiment, when the furnace opening <b>3</b> of the reaction tube <b>4</b> is closed by the lid <b>5</b>, it is possible to prevent the quartz lid <b>5</b>B from being directly brought into contact with the bottom flange <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the reaction tube <b>4</b> made of quartz, thus preventing the quartz particles from being generated. Further, as described above, the circumferential groove <b>76</b> is formed in the upper surface of the quartz lid <b>5</b>B and the cooling water is flown through the coolant path <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the support ring <b>70</b>, thus preventing the sealing member <b>77</b> from being deteriorated by the heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, according to the above embodiment, a support ring is brought into contact with a bottom surface of a flange holding part so that a gap is defined between a quartz lid and a bottom flange, and a sealing member is arranged outward from the gap in a radial direction. With this configuration, when a furnace opening of a reaction tube is closed by the quartz lid, the reaction tube is not directly brought into contact with the quartz lid. Also, since the sealing member is arranged outward from the gap in the radial direction, the furnace opening of the reaction tube can be stably closed by the quartz lid. Further, it is possible to prevent metal parts constituting the furnace opening from being corroded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosures.
