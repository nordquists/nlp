<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims foreign priority to European Application No. EP 15179950.9, filed Aug. 6, 2015, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosed technology generally relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly to a gate all around (GAA) semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Technology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Increasing chip density is the workhorse of the semiconductor industry. Among other trends, one trend in the semiconductor industry is a shift from planar devices to devices utilizing fully-depleted and/or three dimensional architectures, such as FinFET devices. However, as FinFET devices start to face their own challenges associated with scaling to advanced technology nodes, e.g., 10 nm technology node and beyond, including performance challenges arising from parasitic capacitances and resistances and processing challenges arising from advancedpatterning, devices having alternative architectures and structures are being explored. One device being explored is gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire (NW) devices, which are promising candidates for replacing FinFET devices in future technology generations, in part due to their superior electrostatic and gate control. For example, it has been noted that channel lengths can be more aggressively scaled in a GAA NW device compared to FinFET devices. In addition, an undoped channel may be used in a GAA NW device, thereby reducing the threshold voltage variation between devices. Furthermore, to achieve higher layout efficiency and device density, GAA NW devices may be vertically stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent application WO2014018201 A1 describes a nanowire transistor device and a method for manufacturing such a nanowire transistor device. The manufacturing technique is based on the so-called top down approach which involves nanowire fabrication using a CMOS compatible technology, such as lithography-based patterning and etching. The CMOS integration scheme in WO2014018201 uses two distinct stacks for nFET and for pFET. The p-type layer stack is manufactured completely independent of the process for the n-type layer stack. The nFET stack and the pFET stack are arranged independently aside of one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need to provide a more compact GAA NW device.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The disclosure will be further elucidated by means of the following detailed description of several embodiments of the disclosure and the appended figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure and how it may be practiced in particular embodiments. However, it will be understood that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and techniques have not been described in detail, so as not to obscure the present disclosure. While the present disclosure will be described with respect to particular embodiments and with reference to certain drawings, the disclosure is not limited hereto. The drawings included and described herein are schematic and are not limiting the scope of the disclosure. It is also noted that in the drawings, the size of some elements may be exaggerated and, therefore, not drawn to scale for illustrative purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The term “comprising”, used in the claims, should not be interpreted as being restricted to the means listed thereafter; it does not exclude other elements or steps. It needs to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components as referred to, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or groups thereof. Thus, the scope of the expression “a device comprising means A and B” should not be limited to devices consisting only of components A and B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">“Horizontal” refers to a general direction along or parallel to a primary surface of a substrate, and “vertical” is a direction generally orthogonal thereto. “Horizontal” and “vertical” are used as generally perpendicular directions relative to each other independent of the orientation of the substrate in the three-dimensional space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In the following, certain embodiments will be described with reference to a silicon (Si) substrate, but it should be understood that they apply equally well to other semiconductor substrates. In embodiments, the “substrate” may include a semiconductor substrate such as e.g. a silicon, a germanium (Ge), or a silicon germanium (SiGe) substrate, a gallium arsenide (GaAs), a gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), an indium phosphide (InP). The “substrate” may include for example, an insulating layer such as a SiO<sub>2 </sub>or a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer in addition to a semiconductor substrate portion. Thus, the term substrate also includes silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, e.g., silicon-on-glass or silicon-on-sapphire substrates. The term “substrate” is thus used to define generally the elements for layers that underlie a layer or portions of interest. Also, the “substrate” may be any other base on which a layer is formed, for example a glass or metal layer. Accordingly a substrate may be a wafer such as a blanket wafer or may be a layer applied to another base material, e.g. an epitaxial layer grown onto a lower layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The substrate preferably comprises a semiconductor material such as Si or Ge. The substrate can, for example, be formed of silicon, silicon on insulator, germanium on insulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As described herein, a “nanowire’ refers to an elongated semiconductor structure having a ratio of a length in an elongation direction to a width (or a height depending on the geometry) in a direction orthogonal to the length direction that is greater than two. A nanowire can have a width that is less than about 100 nm, less than about 50 nm, or less than about 20 nm, according to various embodiments. A nanowire can have a circular, an elliptical or any polygonal cross-sectional shape, e.g., a rectangle or a square shape. Additionally, the terms “nanoribbon,” “semiconductor wire” or “nanosheet” may be used. A nanoribbon refers to a nanowire having asymmetric height to width ratio, whereas a symmetric nanowire refers to a nanowire having equal height and width and thus has symmetric height to width ratio (i.e. 1 to 1). The nanowire may have a cylindrical shape, having a radius and a length. The terms nanowire and nanoribbon may be used interchangeable and the concepts and techniques described in this disclosure are equally applicable to both geometries. A nanosheet refers to a rectangular shaped nanowire with a length, height and width. A semiconductor fin may also be patterned to form a nanowire (which is then square or rectangular shaped). A nanowire may further be fabricated in two geometries being lateral and vertical. A lateral nanowire has a lateral orientation towards the substrate or substrate surface. It may also be referred to as horizontal nanowire. A vertical nanowire has its orientation perpendicular or vertical towards the substrate or substrate surface. The nanowire referred to in the present disclosure refers to a lateral (or horizontal) nanowire and is not applicable for a vertical nanowire. The horizontal nanowires referred to in the present disclosure comprise two ends, one at each side of the nanowire.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The device comprises a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The substrate <b>100</b> preferably is a bulk Si substrate or a silicon-on-insulator substrate (SOI). A SOI substrate is a layered silicon-insulator-silicon substrate comprising a buried oxide (BOX) layer sandwiched in between a Si support layer and a Si device layer. The nanowire semiconductor device is manufactured in the Si device layer, which is the top layer of the SOI substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">It is an advantage of using a SOI substrate that the device is isolated by the buried oxide (BOX) layer of the SOI substrate from the support layer. Some benefits linked with SOI substrate are for example low leakage currents, latchup resistant, lower parasitic capacitance. A SOI substrate however also has the disadvantage of being very expensive (cost is about ten times more than bulk silicon wafers). SOI substrates also suffer from poor thermal conductivity, which makes heat dissipation from devices difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The disclosure will now be explained with reference to a bulk semiconductor substrate. However, it will be understood that the embodiments may be implemented in any substrate described above.

The “conversion material” <b>106</b> refers to the material which is provided at the (both or only one of the two) ends of some nanowires (the nanowires intended to be converted into second-type nanowires) in order to convert “the first material” into “the second material”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The first-type or the second-type in turn may refer to the dopant type of the nanowire material. For example, one of the first-type or the second-type material can refer to one of a p-type or an n-type material, whereas the other of the first-type or the second-type material can refer to the other of the p-type or the n-type material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">According to embodiments, the substrate <b>100</b> comprises a top part <b>100</b> <i>a </i>which comprises a semiconductor oxide, the semiconductor oxide being an oxidized part from the semiconductor substrate.

According to alternative embodiments (where both inner part and outer parts form the channel region) the nanowires only comprise the channel region (which will thus coincide with the inner part <b>170</b> and the outer parts <b>171</b>). In this case the source and drain region <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> are present at both ends and aside of the nanowires, thus not being part of the nanowire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">According to various embodiments, the nanowire (first-type <b>1101</b> and/or second-type <b>1102</b>) may be a junction-less nanowire configured for a junction-less nanowire transistor. As described herein, a junction-less transistor refers to a transistor in which the source/drain regions and the channel region do not form a semiconductor junction therebetween, as understood in the art to be formed between two oppositely doped semiconductor regions. In some embodiments, the nanowires of the first-type <b>1101</b> and/or the second-type <b>1102</b> are junction-less nanowires configured for junction-less nanowire transistors. Thus, according to embodiments, the junction-less nanowires are doped, e.g., heavily doped (p- or n-type) throughout the entire nanowire. It is an advantage of a junction-less nanowire that the nanowire is completely doped before the conversion step. Thus, no further doping is performed after the conversion step, according to embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The first-type nanowire <b>1101</b> comprises a first material <b>101</b>.

The channel region of the first-type nanowire <b>101</b> coincides thus substantially with the entire nanowire having a length L.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">As described herein, a gate length L<sub>G </sub>refers to the physical length of the physical (wrapped) gate and covers part of the channel that is controlled by the gate. The effective channel length is determined due to the lateral diffusion of source and drain junctions (if junctions are present). The effective channel length is thus typically somewhat different than the gate length L<sub>G </sub>as source/drain junction do not coincide exactly with the boundaries of the physical gate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In various embodiments, the gate length L<sub>G </sub>of the device is shorter than about 40 nm, or shorter than about 20 nm. In addition, when a cross-section of the channel region, which serves as an active area of the nanowire transistor, has a circular or an elliptical shape, the channel region has a diameter or a longest diameter that is less than about 10 nm, or between about 2 nm and about 10 nm. Alternatively, when a cross-section of the channel region has a rectangular or a rhomboidal shape, the channel region preferably has a cross-sectional side or the longest cross-sectional side that is less than about 10 nm or between about 2 nm and about 10 nm. In various embodiments, the nanowire length L does not exceed about 40 nm. Under some circumstances, when the nanowire length L is less than 40 nm, the converting process may become more challenging during the manufacturing of the device. For example, during a Ge condensation step (as described in more detail further below), it is desirable for the SiGe of the conversion material <b>106</b> to be driven in through an entire length of the second-type nanowire <b>1102</b>. However, if the nanowire is too long, it is possible that the nanowire is not completely converted into the second material <b>106</b>. However, in other circumstances, it may be tolerable or desirable to have a partial conversion across the length of the second-type nanowire <b>1102</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method starts with providing a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, according to embodiments. The substrate <b>100</b> preferably is a bulk Si substrate or a silicon-on-insulator substrate (SOI). A SOI substrate is a layered silicon-insulator-silicon substrate comprising a buried oxide (BOX) layer sandwiched in between a Si support layer and a Si device layer. The nanowire semiconductor device is manufactured in the Si device layer, which is the top layer of the SOI substrate. The Si support layer is the bottom the layer of the SOI substrate. The SOI substrate may be manufactured using techniques commonly known by a person skilled in the art such as wafer bonding or separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The disclosure will now be explained with reference to a bulk semiconductor substrate. However, it will be understood that any of the substrates described above can be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">After providing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> a vertical stack <b>1100</b> of alternating nanowires <b>1101</b>,<b>1102</b> and interlayer nanowires <b>1103</b> is provided on the main surface <b>111</b> of the substrate <b>100</b>, each horizontal interlayer nanowire being positioned or sandwiched in between and in direct contact with two horizontal nanowires (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The lowest layer of the stack <b>1100</b> (in contact with the main surface <b>111</b> of the substrate) is preferably an interlayer nanowire. The interlayer nanowires <b>1103</b> are sacrificial or sacrificial nanowires which will be removed and at least partially be replaced by the gate stack later in the process flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The stack <b>1100</b> may be provided using processing steps known by a person skilled, such as for example an STI-first or an STI-last integration flow.

Thereafter the fins may be recessed and the stack <b>1100</b> may be provided by alternating deposition of nanowire material <b>101</b> and interlayer nanowire material <b>103</b> in the recess. Deposition may be done by known deposition techniques such as chemical vapor phase deposition (CVD). The depth of the fin recess will determine the substrate thickness and the number of nanowire transistors stacked in the recess. The nanowire dimensions (such as width and thickness) can be tuned, but the length of the nanowires should preferably be smaller than 40 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">It is an objective of the present disclosure to provide a simplified integration flow for a more compact GAA-device, which means increasing the transistor density on a small footprint.

The sacrificial gate material may be a semiconductor material, e.g., polycrystalline silicon, or a dielectric material, e.g., silicon nitride. In some embodiments, the sacrificial gate material is selected to be a material that is not an oxide or an oxide-based material (not SiO<sub>2</sub>, for example), as to prevent down-diffusion during the following process steps (SiGe condensation). It is an advantage of using a sacrificial gate material which is not an oxide or an oxide-based that down-diffusion of oxygen (which is not present) is prevented and the annealing (Ge condensation) process further in the process flow is optimized.

Each nanowire (which forms part of a transistor) comprises a channel region and may also comprise a source region and a drain region <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>. Alternatively the source and drain region <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> may be arranged at both ends of the nanowires (and thus not forming part of the nanowire).

In the final device, as already described before, the substack of first-type nanowires <b>1101</b> comprises at least one nanowire comprising a first material <b>101</b> and the substack of second-type nanowires <b>1102</b> comprises at least one nanowire comprising a second material <b>160</b>, being different from the first material <b>101</b>. The material <b>101</b> of the nanowires intended to form the second set (second-type) <b>1102</b> of nanowires will be converted into the second material <b>160</b> thereby resulting in the final second-type nanowires of the semiconductor device. The first material of first set <b>1101</b> of nanowires will remain substantially unchanged during the further process steps (except for possible doping). This means the first set <b>1101</b> of nanowires as formed after providing the patterned structure already define the final (first) nanowires of the final device. The final device thus at least comprises a nanowire from the first set of nanowires <b>1101</b> and a nanowire from the second set <b>1102</b> of nanowires.</div>

A spacer layer <b>120</b> is deposited aside the first set <b>1101</b> of nanowires (i.e. aside and in contact with the nanowires and the interlayer nanowires which are still present) of the vertical stack of nanowires. The spacer layer <b>120</b> may comprise for example SiN or other materials known for a person skilled in the art which are commonly used as spacers. The spacer layer material should be different from the first or second material and preferably is not oxygen-based.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The conversion material <b>106</b> may be provided aside and in contact of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) and also the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or only aside and in contact with the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), according to different embodiments. Deposition techniques such as epitaxial growth (for the option shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or selective epitaxial growth (SEG) (for the option shown in FIG.<b>7</b>). The conversion material <b>106</b> being present aside both the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) and interlayer <b>103</b> nanowires or only aside of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) depends on different parameters. Depending on the Ge concentration in the conversion material <b>106</b> and the Ge concentration in the first material <b>101</b>, the conversion material <b>106</b> will grow only on the side of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) or on both the sides of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b>. Also a pre-epi cleaning step of the side of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) may influence whether the conversion material <b>106</b> will grow only on the side of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) or also on the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">According to embodiments the conversion material <b>106</b> may be provided only at one side of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>). This has the advantage of the possibility to form an asymmetric nanowire device where only a left part or a right side part of the nanowire (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>) is converted into the second material <b>160</b>. This may be advantageous for example for tunnel FET devices which have opposite conductive types for source and drain regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">When selective epitaxial growth (SEG) (for the option shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is used for forming the conversion material <b>106</b>, a void <b>107</b> is created between the grown conversion material <b>106</b> of adjacent nanowires <b>101</b>. This ensures a better oxygen control in one of the further steps of converting the first material <b>101</b> into the second material <b>160</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">As the first set <b>1101</b> of nanowires are encapsulated, the conversion material <b>106</b> is not formed aside or in contact with this set <b>1101</b> and will thus also not influence the first material of the nanowires <b>101</b> in this set <b>1101</b> in the further steps of the method (more specifically the step of converting the first material). The conversion material <b>106</b> is thus selectively provided at the ends of the nanowires (intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>), which means the conversion material <b>106</b> is only provided at the ends of the nanowires which are to be converted and not provided at the ends of the other nanowires which are not to be converted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">After providing the conversion material <b>106</b> a dielectric material <b>108</b> is provided to encapsulate the intermediate device (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). This dielectric layer <b>108</b> also protects the substrate, the nanowires, the second channel material and the spacer layer during the following process steps. The dielectric material <b>108</b> comprises an oxide such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>which is important for the conversion step (more specifically to diffuse to oxygen during the Ge condensation process (which is explained further).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a next step the sacrificial gate <b>104</b> and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b> are removed, according to embodiments. This may be done in a simultaneous step, but most probably in different steps as the sacrificial gate <b>104</b> and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b> preferably comprise a different material. Standard etching techniques may be used to remove the sacrificial gate <b>104</b> and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Where according to embodiments the conversion material <b>160</b> is present on both the nanowires intended to form the second-type nanowires and the interlayer nanowires (as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and where the conversion material <b>106</b> and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b> both comprise SiGe, the etch chemistry for removing the interlayer nanowire <b>103</b> should be adapted such that the conversion material <b>106</b> is not removed or etched away (during removal of the interlayer nanowires). The etching chemistry should thus be selective to the material of the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">According to embodiments the cavities <b>109</b> formed in between the nanowires <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b> by removing the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b> may be refilled by an oxygen-free layer to better anchor the nanowires (not shown) and as such prevent wiggling of the nanowires in further process steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, after removing the sacrificial gate <b>104</b> and the interlayer nanowires <b>103</b>, the first material <b>101</b> of the nanowires intended to form the second set <b>1102</b> of nanowires is converted into the second material <b>160</b>, according to embodiments. This process step involves driving in the species of the conversion material <b>106</b> into the nanowires <b>1102</b>. According to embodiments, Si nanowires may be converted substantially entirely into SiGe nanowires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">According to embodiments, without being bound to any theory, a Ge-condensation process may at least partially cause the conversion of the first material <b>101</b> of nanowires intended to form the second set <b>1102</b> of nanowires. The Ge-condensation process can include an oxidation process. The oxidation process is done by annealing the intermediate device. The Ge-condensation method according to embodiments based on the selective or preferential oxidation of Si atoms (over Ge-atoms) of the conversion material <b>106</b> (comprising SiGe) and thus forming SiO<sub>2</sub>. Due to the formation of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and the non-diffusivity of Ge in SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ge atoms diffuse into the SiGe/Si interface into the nanowires <b>1102</b> and form there a SiGe nanowire (by thus partially or completely converting the nanowires <b>1102</b> comprising Si into SiGe). The concentration of Ge (the second material <b>160</b>) in the converted nanowires <b>1102</b> will be higher than the Ge-content of the conversion material <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">According to embodiments the nanowires intended to form the second set of nanowire <b>1102</b> are partially or completely converted, as has been described already in detail before. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> schematically shows a complete conversion of the nanowires intended to form the second type of nanowires <b>1102</b>, whereas <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> schematically shows a partial conversion. As also described before depending on the conversion the channel region of the nanowires may cover the complete nanowire <b>1102</b> or only inner part of the nanowire <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The annealing is done at a temperature of about 800 degrees Celsius for a period of about 60 minutes in a dry oxygen ambient. Depending on the need for a complete or a partial conversion of the nanowires intended to form the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>, the annealing parameters may be varied and adapted for different implementations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">During the conversion step also top part <b>100</b> <i>a </i>of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may be influenced and converted into a semiconductor oxide material. For example if the semiconductor substrate comprises Si, the top part <b>100</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate will be converted into SiO<sub>2 </sub>due to the annealing/oxidation step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The conversion material <b>106</b> is preferably completely consumed after the Ge condensation step. It may happen that some conversion material <b>106</b> is left at the sides (due to incomplete Ge condensation), however this remaining conversion material <b>106</b> will be removed prior to providing the final source and drain regions <b>121</b>,<b>122</b> of the second-type nanowires <b>1102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">After the conversion step, the final source and drain regions <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> (which may involve a doping step at the side of the device) and respective source <b>131</b>, drain <b>132</b> and gate contacting of the device may be formed according to process steps known for a person skilled in the art resulting in a nanowire device according to the disclosure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and/or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.
