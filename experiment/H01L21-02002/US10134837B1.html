<heading id="h-0002">Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to integrated circuits (ICs). More specifically, the present disclosure relates to porous silicon processing.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Background</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">One goal driving the wireless communication industry is providing consumers with increased bandwidth. The use of carrier aggregation in current generation communications provides one possible solution for achieving this goal. Carrier aggregation enables a wireless carrier to increase bandwidth by simultaneously using multiple frequencies for a single communication stream. While an increased amount of data is provided to the end user, carrier aggregation implementation is complicated by noise created at the harmonic frequencies due to the frequencies used for data transmission. For example, 700 MHz transmissions may create harmonics at 2.1 GHz, which interfere with data broadcast at 2 GHz frequencies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The design complexity of mobile radio frequency (RF) chips (e.g., mobile RF transceivers) is complicated by added circuit functions to support communication enhancements, such as carrier aggregation. The design of these mobile RF transceivers may include the use of semiconductor on insulator technology. Semiconductor on insulator (SOI) technology replaces conventional silicon substrates with a layered silicon-insulator-silicon substrate to reduce parasitic device capacitance and improve performance. SOI-based devices differ from conventional, silicon-built devices because the silicon junction is above an electrical isolator, typically a buried oxide (BOX) layer. A reduced thickness BOX layer, however, may not sufficiently reduce artificial harmonics caused by the proximity of an active device on the silicon layer and a substrate supporting the BOX layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, high performance complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) radio frequency (RF) switch technologies are currently manufactured using SOI substrates. While SOI substrates may provide some protection against artificial harmonics in RF transceivers that support carrier aggregation, there is a need for increasing device isolation and reducing RF loss. For example, a CMOS switch device may be physically bonded to a high resistivity (HR) handle wafer, such as HR-silicon or sapphire. The increased spatial separation of the switch device from the underlying substrate dramatically improves the RF performance of the CMOS switch. Unfortunately the use of SOI wafers and handle substrates is quite expensive relative to the cost of a bulk semiconductor wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The detailed description set forth below, in connection with the appended drawings, is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the various concepts. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, however, that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts. As described herein, the use of the term “and/or” is intended to represent an “inclusive OR”, and the use of the term “or” is intended to represent an “exclusive OR”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Mobile radio frequency (RF) chip designs (e.g., mobile RF transceivers) have migrated to a deep sub-micron process node due to cost and power consumption considerations. The design complexity of mobile RF transceivers is further complicated by added circuit functions to support communication enhancements, such as carrier aggregation. While an increased amount of data is provided to the end user, carrier aggregation implementation is complicated by noise created at the harmonic frequencies due to the frequencies used for data transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The design complexity of mobile radio frequency (RF) chips (e.g., mobile RF transceivers) is complicated by added circuit functions to support communication enhancements, such as carrier aggregation. The design of these mobile RF transceivers may include the use of semiconductor on insulator technology. Semiconductor on insulator (SOI) technology replaces conventional silicon substrates with a layered silicon-insulator-silicon substrate to reduce parasitic device capacitance and improve performance. SOI-based devices differ from conventional, silicon-built devices because the silicon junction is above an electrical isolator, typically a buried oxide (BOX) layer. A reduced thickness BOX layer, however, may not sufficiently reduce artificial harmonics caused by the proximity of an active device on the silicon layer and a substrate supporting the BOX layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">High performance complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) radio frequency (RF) switch technologies are manufactured using SOI substrates. To increase device isolation and reduce RF losses (e.g., due to artificial harmonics), such switch devices may then be physically bonded to a high resistivity (HR) handle wafer, such as HR-silicon or sapphire. The increased spatial separation of the switch device from the underlying substrate dramatically improves the RF performance of the CMOS switch. Unfortunately the use of SOI wafers including, for example, a trap rich layer, is quite expensive relative to the cost of a bulk semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Various aspects of the disclosure provide techniques for forming an etch stop layer proximate an insulator layer of a bulk semiconductor handle wafer. The etch stop layer prevents etching of the bulk semiconductor handle wafer. The etch stop layer may also function as a trap rich layer (TRL), and reduces harmonics of an RF device and increases linearity significantly relative to current techniques. For example, a circuit may be fabricated on a wafer (e.g., a CMOS wafer), and a backside of the wafer may be etched up to the etch stop layer to form porous silicon. The conversion of the semiconductor handle substrate to porous silicon results in a significant improvement of CMOS RF switch harmonics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Porous silicon is relatively inexpensive to produce. In particular, porous silicon can be fabricated by introducing a silicon wafer to an electro-chemical etch in dilute hydrofluoric acid. A bulk semiconductor handle wafer may be subjected to, for example, an electro-chemical etch process to form porous silicon within a surface of the bulk semiconductor handle wafer. The degree of porosity of the porous silicon may be controlled by a current density, a concentration of the acid, and a duration of the etch. Cost is reduced when porous silicon is formed in the bulk semiconductor handle wafer in place of a conventional, trap rich silicon handle wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood that the term “layer” includes film and is not to be construed as indicating a vertical or horizontal thickness unless otherwise stated. As described, the term “substrate” may refer to a substrate of a diced wafer or may refer to a substrate of a wafer that is not diced. Similarly, the terms chip and die may be used interchangeably unless such interchanging would tax credulity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Various aspects of the disclosure provide techniques for creating an etch stop layer proximate an insulator (e.g., BOX) layer of a SOI device. The SOI device initially includes a bulk semiconductor handle wafer. The etch stop layer may allow complete conversion of a backside of a processed bulk semiconductor handle wafer into a porous semiconductor layer. In aspects of the present disclosure, a porous silicon handle wafer functions as a trap rich layer without having to use a conventional trap rich silicon handle wafer, which is twice the cost of a bulk silicon wafer. The etch stop layer may also function as a trap rich layer (TRL) for radio frequency (RF) integrated circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">A bulk semiconductor handle wafer may be a uniformly doped P-type or N-type substrate, rather than an implanted substrate. An advantage of uniform doping over implanting is that uniform doping results in uniformity of pores in a porous silicon layer (e.g., porous layer). This pore uniformity enables the porous silicon layer to have a depth greater than a predetermined isolation depth (e.g., 10 microns), which directly relates to the effective resistivity of the porous silicon layer. In the case of RF signals, the porous silicon layer should be deep enough (e.g., &gt;10 microns) to fully isolate the active device while also allowing for application of RF switches by providing an increased resistivity. In aspects of the present disclosure, a bulk semiconductor handle wafer may be porous throughout a majority of its thickness to break up effects from a parasitic resistance channel of any associated RF circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, ion implantation of an etch stop material is performed beneath an insulator layer (e.g., a buried oxide (BOX) layer) of an SOI device and into a handle semiconductor substrate of the SOI device. Once the etch stop layer is formed, a front-end-of-line (FEOL) process creates active devices (e.g., an RF switch device) in a device semiconductor layer of the SOI device. After the FEOL process is complete, an exposed backside of the semiconductor handle substrate undergoes conversion to porous silicon by exposure to a single cell, electrolyzing bath of hydrofluoric (HF) acid. For example, a bulk semiconductor wafer (e.g., a bulk silicon (Si) wafer) may be subjected to an electro-chemical etch process to form porous silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In one aspect of the present disclosure, porous silicon is formed throughout the handle semiconductor substrate until the porous etch stop is encountered. The etch stop layer protects the porous silicon formation from affecting the insulator layer or the semiconductor device layer. In addition, the etch stop layer may function as a trap rich layer. The porous silicon reduces harmonics of an RF device and increases linearity significantly relative to current techniques. The conversion of the entire semiconductor handle substrate to porous silicon results in a significant improvement of CMOS RF switch harmonics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Advantageously, the etch stop layer also functions as a trap rich layer without using a conventional trap rich silicon handle wafer, which may be twice the cost of a bulk silicon wafer. In one configuration, the etch stop layer may be implanted on a front-side surface of a semiconductor device substrate. An insulator layer (e.g., a buried oxide (BOX) layer) may be supported by the substrate. A device layer may further be supported by the BOX layer. The device semiconductor layer may be composed of an epitaxially grown silicon layer that is in a range of 150 to 750 angstroms. The substrate may be 200 microns, with a 50 micron porous layer, in one configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a wafer. A wafer <b>100</b> may be a semiconductor wafer, SOI wafer, or may be a substrate material with one or more layers of material on a surface of the wafer <b>100</b>. The wafer <b>100</b> may be a compound material, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) or gallium nitride (GaN), a ternary material such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), quaternary materials, silicon, quartz, glass, or any material that can be a substrate material. Although many of the materials may be crystalline in nature, polycrystalline or amorphous materials may also be used for the wafer <b>100</b>. For example, various options for the substrate include a glass substrate, a semiconductor substrate, a core laminate substrate, a coreless substrate, a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate, or other like substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The wafer <b>100</b>, or layers that are coupled to the wafer <b>100</b>, may be supplied with materials that enable formation of different types of electronic devices in or on the wafer <b>100</b>. In addition, the wafer <b>100</b> may have an orientation <b>102</b> that indicates the crystalline orientation of the wafer <b>100</b>. The orientation <b>102</b> may be a flat edge of the wafer <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or may be a notch or other indicia to illustrate the crystalline orientation of the wafer <b>100</b>. The orientation <b>102</b> may indicate the Miller Indices for the planes of the crystal lattice in the wafer <b>100</b>, assuming a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the wafer <b>100</b> has been processed as desired, the wafer <b>100</b> is divided up along dicing lines <b>104</b>. For example, once fabrication of integrated circuits on the wafer <b>100</b> is complete, the wafer <b>100</b> is divided up along the dicing lines <b>104</b>, which may be referred to as “dicing streets.” The dicing lines <b>104</b> indicate where the wafer <b>100</b> is to be broken apart or separated into pieces. The dicing lines <b>104</b> may define the outline of the various integrated circuits that have been fabricated on the wafer <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the dicing lines <b>104</b> are defined, the wafer <b>100</b> may be sawn or otherwise separated into pieces to form the die <b>106</b>. Each of the die <b>106</b> may be an integrated circuit with many devices or may be a single electronic device. The physical size of the die <b>106</b>, which may also be referred to as a chip or a semiconductor chip, depends at least in part on the ability to separate the wafer <b>100</b> into certain sizes, as well as the number of individual devices that the die <b>106</b> is designed to contain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the wafer <b>100</b> has been separated into one or more die <b>106</b>, the die <b>106</b> may be mounted into packaging to allow access to the devices and/or integrated circuits fabricated on the die <b>106</b>. Packaging may include single in-line packaging, dual in-line packaging, motherboard packaging, flip-chip packaging, indium dot/bump packaging, or other types of devices that provide access to the die <b>106</b>. The die <b>106</b> may also be directly accessed through wire bonding, probes, or other connections without mounting the die <b>106</b> into a separate package. The wafer <b>100</b>, may be used as a handle substrate including an etch stop layer for forming a porous silicon layer, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a die <b>106</b>. In the die <b>106</b>, there may be a substrate <b>200</b>, which may be a semiconductor material and/or may act as a mechanical support for electronic devices. The substrate <b>200</b> may be a doped semiconductor substrate, which has either electrons (designated N-channel) or holes (designated P-channel) charge carriers present throughout the substrate <b>200</b>. Subsequent doping of the substrate <b>200</b> with charge carrier ions/atoms may change the charge carrying capabilities of the substrate <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the substrate may be a semi-insulating substrate, including compound semiconductor transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Within a substrate <b>200</b> (e.g., a semiconductor substrate), there may be wells <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>, which may be the source and/or drain of a field-effect transistor (FET), or wells <b>202</b> and/or <b>204</b> may be fin structures of a fin structured FET (FinFET). Wells <b>202</b> and/or <b>204</b> may also be other devices (e.g., a resistor, a capacitor, a diode, or other electronic devices) depending on the structure and other characteristics of the wells <b>202</b> and/or <b>204</b> and the surrounding structure of the substrate <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The semiconductor substrate may also have a well <b>206</b> and a well <b>208</b>. The well <b>208</b> may be completely within the well <b>206</b>, and, in some cases, may form a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT), or other like compound semiconductor transistor. The well <b>206</b> may also be used as an isolation well to isolate the well <b>208</b> from electric and/or magnetic fields within the die <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Layers (e.g., <b>210</b> through <b>214</b>) may be added to the die <b>106</b>. The layer <b>210</b> may be, for example, an oxide or insulating layer that may isolate the wells (e.g., <b>202</b>-<b>208</b>) from each other or from other devices on the die <b>106</b>. In such cases, the layer <b>210</b> may be silicon dioxide, a polymer, a dielectric, or another electrically insulating layer. The layer <b>210</b> may also be an interconnection layer, in which case it may comprise a conductive material such as copper, tungsten, aluminum, an alloy, or other conductive or metallic materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The layer <b>212</b> may also be a dielectric or conductive layer, depending on the desired device characteristics and/or the materials of the layers (e.g., <b>210</b> and <b>214</b>). The layer <b>214</b> may be an encapsulating layer, which may protect the layers (e.g., <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>), as well as the wells <b>202</b>-<b>208</b> and the substrate <b>200</b>, from external forces. For example, and not by way of limitation, the layer <b>214</b> may be a layer that protects the die <b>106</b> from mechanical damage, or the layer <b>214</b> may be a layer of material that protects the die <b>106</b> from electromagnetic or radiation damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Electronic devices designed on the die <b>106</b> may comprise many features or structural components. For example, the die <b>106</b> may be exposed to any number of methods to impart dopants into the substrate <b>200</b>, the wells <b>202</b>-<b>208</b>, and, if desired, the layers (e.g., <b>210</b>-<b>214</b>). For example, and not by way of limitation, the die <b>106</b> may be exposed to ion implantation, deposition of dopant atoms that are driven into a crystalline lattice through a diffusion process, chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth, or other methods. Through selective growth, material selection, and removal of portions of the layers (e.g., <b>210</b>-<b>214</b>), and through selective removal, material selection, and dopant concentration of the substrate <b>200</b> and the wells <b>202</b>-<b>208</b>, many different structures and electronic devices may be formed within the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the substrate <b>200</b>, the wells <b>202</b>-<b>208</b>, and the layers (e.g., <b>210</b>-<b>214</b>) may be selectively removed or added through various processes. Chemical wet etching, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), plasma etching, photoresist masking, damascene processes, and other methods may create the structures and devices of the present disclosure. Aspects of the present disclosure provide RF chips including a handle substrate having an etch stop layer for forming a porous silicon layer. These RF chips on the semiconductor handle substrates may also include filters, diplexers, a triplexers, low pass filters, and/or a notch filter, or other like circuit elements useful in the formation of radio frequency (RF) front end modules, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Various aspects of the disclosure provide techniques for ion implanting an etch stop layer in a semiconductor handle substrate of a semiconductor on insulator (SOI) device. For example, the etch stop layer may be formed proximate (e.g., below) an insulator layer (e.g., BOX layer) of the SOI device. Once formed, a circuit may be fabricated in a device semiconductor layer supported by the semiconductor handle substrate having the etch stop layer. Subsequently, a backside of the semiconductor handle substrate is converted to porous silicon through a hydrofluoric (HF) acid etch that stops on the etch stop layer. The etch stop layer prevents the etch from damaging the device semiconductor layer. Additionally, the etch stop layer and the backside porous silicon layer of the semiconductor handle substrate may reduce harmonics of an RF device. For example, the etch stop layer and the backside porous silicon layer of the semiconductor handle substrate may reduce harmonics of the RF device, while significantly increases linearity relative to current techniques.</div>

The semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b> (e.g., a bulk semiconductor handle wafer or SOI wafer) may also include a porous silicon layer <b>360</b> (e.g., a porous semiconductor layer). The etch stop layer <b>340</b> may have various depths in relation to a thickness of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b>. For example, the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b> may have a thickness of 50 microns, and the etch stop layer <b>340</b> may be 10 microns deep. Of course, various other thicknesses for the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b> and depths of the etch stop layer <b>340</b> are possible. According to various aspects of the present disclosure, the porous silicon layer <b>360</b> extends from a backside of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b> and stops at the etch stop layer <b>340</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the etch stop layer <b>340</b> may be ion-implanted in a front-side surface of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b>. For example, the ion implant may be implanted germanium. Alternatively, the etch stop layer <b>340</b> may be a counter-doped layer. For example, a P-type substrate may be counter-doped with N-type dopants, or an N-type substrate may be counter-doped with P-type dopants to form the counter-doped layer. The counter-doped layer prevents porous silicon from forming when the dopants are in a range of 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>P-type to 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>N-type. This range is exemplary only, and other ranges are possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">An insulator layer <b>310</b> (e.g., a buried oxide (BOX) layer) may be deposited on the front-side surface of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b>. A device semiconductor layer <b>320</b> may be deposited over the insulator layer <b>310</b>. Subsequently, an ion-implantation process may be used to implant ions into the front-side surface of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>302</b>. The ion-implantation process may also occur at any point prior to depositing the device semiconductor layer <b>320</b>. The etch stop layer <b>340</b> may contact the insulator layer <b>310</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the porous semiconductor layer <b>560</b> may include large pores, medium pores, and small pores. For example, the sizes of the pores may decrease towards the front side of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b>, and may increase towards the backside of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b>, thus creating different depths with different porosities. This may be due to the chemical etching inwardly from the backside of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b>. Because the backside is etched first, and the chemical etch penetrates deeper from the backside, the region between the front side and the backside are affected less, resulting in smaller pores toward the front side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">According to additional aspects of the present disclosure, the porous semiconductor layer <b>560</b> may be a porous silicon layer having different porosities. For example, the porous semiconductor layer <b>560</b> may be 30% porous, 40% porous, etc. The porosity of a 30% porous silicon layer may be more uniform as compared to a 40% porous silicon layer. This may be due to the chemical etch affecting the backside of the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b> more evenly at a lower porosity. As the desired porosity increases, the sizes of the pores may vary greater according to their depths in relation to the backside, because the direction of the chemical etch moves inwardly from the backside. The porosity of the porous semiconductor layer <b>560</b> may be controlled by a duration of the etch, a concentration of the acid, a current density, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, performance results for higher porosities indicate that higher porosities may be desired as a trap rich layer. As the porosity increases, so does the variation in sizes of pores. Additionally, if the substrate is too porous (e.g., above 80%), the substrate may become brittle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">According to additional aspects of the present disclosure, the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b> may be back grinded to thin out the SOI device <b>500</b>. The back grinding may occur before or after HF etching. Back grinding after etching may be advantageous in that porous silicon is more easily grinded for higher precision thinning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">An advantage of using the semiconductor handle substrate <b>502</b> with an etch stop layer <b>540</b> is that the etch stop layer <b>540</b> prevents damage to the active device <b>522</b>, while also creating a trap rich layer (TRL) and being relatively inexpensive to manufacture. The porous semiconductor layer <b>560</b> also exhibits trap rich layer characteristics. For example, performance comparisons between conventional high resistivity (HR) trap rich layer substrates and porous silicon show that a 30% porous substrate yields at least a 35 dB improvement.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Various aspects of the present disclosure provide techniques for forming an etch stop layer that also functions as a trap rich layer (TRL) on a top surface of a bulk semiconductor handle wafer. The etch stop layer reduces harmonics of an RF device and increases linearity significantly relative to current techniques.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Porous silicon may be cheaply fabricated by introducing a silicon wafer to an electro-chemical etch in dilute hydrofluoric acid. For example, a bulk semiconductor wafer may be subjected to an electro-chemical etch process to form porous silicon within a surface of the bulk semiconductor wafer. The depth of the etch is controlled by an etch stop layer. The degree of porosity of the porous silicon may be controlled by a current density, a concentration of the acid, and a duration of the etch. Cost may be reduced by forming the etch stop layer on a bulk semiconductor handle wafer, rather than using a conventional, trap rich silicon handle wafer. The etch stop layer functions as a trap rich layer without using a conventional trap rich silicon handle wafer, which is twice the cost of a bulk silicon wafer.</div>

A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of receiver devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration. Alternatively, some operations or methods may be performed by circuitry that is specific to a given function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In one or more exemplary aspects, the functions described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored as one or more instructions or code on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium or non-transitory processor-readable storage medium. The operations of a method or algorithm disclosed herein may be embodied in processor-executable instructions that may reside on a non-transitory computer-readable or processor-readable storage medium. Non-transitory computer-readable or processor-readable storage media may be any storage media that may be accessed by a computer or a processor. By way of example but not limitation, such non-transitory computer-readable or processor-readable storage media may include random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), FLASH memory, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that may be accessed by a computer. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, and Blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above are also included within the scope of non-transitory computer-readable and processor-readable media. Additionally, the operations of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and/or instructions on a non-transitory processor-readable storage medium and/or computer-readable storage medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Although the present disclosure and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the technology of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims. For example, relational terms, such as “above” and “below” are used with respect to a substrate or electronic device. Of course, if the substrate or electronic device is inverted, above becomes below, and vice versa. Additionally, if oriented sideways, above and below may refer to sides of a substrate or electronic device. Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular configurations of the process, machine, manufacture, and composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification. As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate from the disclosure, processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, means, methods, or steps, presently existing or later to be developed that perform substantially the same function or achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding configurations described herein may be utilized according to the present disclosure. Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to include within their scope such processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, means, methods, or steps.</div>
