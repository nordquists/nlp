<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Gallium nitride based power devices are typically epitaxially grown on sapphire substrates. The growth of gallium nitride based power devices on a sapphire substrate is a heteroepitaxial growth process since the substrate and the epitaxial layers are composed of different materials. Due to the heteroepitaxial growth process, the epitaxially grown material can exhibit a variety of adverse effects, including reduced uniformity and reductions in metrics associated with the electronic/optical properties of the epitaxial layers. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods and systems related to epitaxial growth processes and substrate structures.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention relates generally to Schottky diodes and power transistors formed on engineered substrates. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and systems suitable for fabricating vertical Schottky diodes and vertical power transistors using epitaxial growth processes. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a method and system for fabricating vertical Schottky diodes and vertical power transistors on a substrate by epitaxial growth, wherein the substrate is characterized by a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is substantially matched to epitaxial layers that form the vertical Schottky diodes and vertical power transistors. The methods and techniques can be applied to a variety of semiconductor processing operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating an engineered substrate structure according to some embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the engineered substrate structure may be suitable for a variety of electronic and optical applications. The engineered substrate structure includes a core <b>110</b> (e.g., AlN Substrate) that can have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is substantially matched to the CTE of the epitaxial material that will be grown on the engineered substrate structure, for example, on the exfoliated silicon (111) layer <b>125</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">For applications including the growth of gallium nitride (GaN)-based materials (epitaxial layers including GaN-based layers), the core <b>110</b> can be a polycrystalline ceramic material, for example, polycrystalline aluminum nitride (AlN), which can include a binding material such as yttrium oxide. Other materials can be utilized in the core, including polycrystalline gallium nitride (GaN), polycrystalline aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), polycrystalline silicon carbide (SiC), polycrystalline zinc oxide (ZnO), polycrystalline gallium trioxide (Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The thickness of the core <b>110</b> can be on the order of 100 to 1,500 μm, for example, 750 μm. The core <b>110</b> is encapsulated in an adhesion layer <b>112</b> that can be referred to as a shell or an encapsulating shell. In an embodiment, the adhesion layer <b>112</b> comprises a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) oxide layer on the order of 1,000 Å in thickness. In other embodiments, the thickness of the adhesion layer <b>112</b> varies, for example, from 100 Å to 2,000 Å. Although TEOS oxides are utilized for adhesion layers <b>112</b> in some embodiments, other materials that provide for adhesion between later deposited layers and underlying layers or materials (e.g., ceramics, in particular, polycrystalline ceramics) can be utilized according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, SiO<sub>2 </sub>or other silicon oxides (Si<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>) adhere well to ceramic materials and provide a suitable surface for subsequent deposition, for example, of conductive materials. The adhesion layer <b>112</b> completely surrounds the core <b>110</b> in some embodiments to form a fully encapsulated core <b>110</b> and can be formed using an LPCVD process or other suitable deposition processes, which can be compatible with semiconductor processing and in particular with polycrystalline or composite substrates and layers. The adhesion layer <b>112</b> provides a surface on which subsequent layers adhere to form elements of the engineered substrate structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to the use of LPCVD processes, spin on glass/dielectrics, furnace-based processes, and the like to form the encapsulating adhesion layer, other semiconductor processes can be utilized according to embodiments of the present invention, including CVD processes or similar deposition processes. As an example, a deposition process that coats a portion of the core <b>110</b> can be utilized, the core <b>110</b> can be flipped over, and the deposition process could be repeated to coat additional portions of the core <b>110</b>. Thus, although LPCVD techniques are utilized in some embodiments to provide a fully encapsulated structure, other film formation techniques can be utilized depending on the particular application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is another simplified schematic diagram illustrating an engineered substrate structure according to some embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>, a conductive layer <b>114</b> is formed surrounding the adhesion layer <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the conductive layer <b>114</b> is a shell of polysilicon (i.e., polycrystalline silicon) that is formed surrounding the adhesion layer <b>112</b> since polysilicon can exhibit poor adhesion to ceramic materials. In embodiments in which the conductive layer <b>114</b> is polysilicon, the thickness of the polysilicon layer can be on the order of 500-5,000 Å, for example, 2,500 Å. In some embodiments, the polysilicon layer can be formed as a shell to completely surround the adhesion layer <b>112</b> (e.g., a TEOS oxide layer), thereby forming a fully encapsulated adhesion layer <b>112</b>, and can be formed using an LPCVD process. In other embodiments, as discussed below, the conductive material can be formed on a portion of the adhesion layer <b>112</b>, for example, a lower half of the substrate structure. In some embodiments, conductive material can be formed as a fully encapsulating layer and subsequently removed on one side of the substrate structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the conductive layer <b>114</b> can be a polysilicon layer doped to provide a highly conductive material, for example, doped with boron to provide a p-type polysilicon layer. In some embodiments, the doping with boron is at a level of 1×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to provide for high conductivity. Other dopants at different dopant concentrations (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, bismuth, or the like at dopant concentrations ranging from 1×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>) can be utilized to provide either n-type or p-type semiconductor materials suitable for use in the conductive layer <b>114</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The presence of the conductive layer <b>114</b> is useful during electrostatic chucking of the engineered substrate to semiconductor processing tools, for example tools with electrostatic chucks (ESC or e-chuck). The conductive layer enables rapid dechucking after processing in the semiconductor processing tools. In embodiments of the present invention, the conductive layer <b>114</b> enables electrical contact with the chuck or capacitive coupling to the e-chuck during future processing including bonding. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide substrate structures that can be processed in manners utilized with conventional silicon wafers. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. Additionally, having a substrate structure with high thermal conductivity in combination with the electrostatic chucking may afford better deposition conditions for the subsequent formation of engineered layers and epitaxial layers, as well as for the subsequent device fabrication steps. For example, it may provide desirable thermal profiles that can result in lower stress, more uniform deposition thicknesses, and better stoichiometry control through the subsequent layer formations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">A second adhesion layer <b>116</b> (e.g., a TEOS oxide layer on the order of 1,000 Å in thickness) is formed surrounding the conductive layer <b>114</b>. The second adhesion layer <b>116</b> completely surrounds the conductive layer <b>114</b> in some embodiments to form a fully encapsulated structure and can be formed using an LPCVD process, a CVD process, or any other suitable deposition process, including the deposition of a spin-on dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A barrier layer <b>118</b>, for example, a silicon nitride layer, is formed surrounding the second adhesion layer <b>116</b>. In an embodiment, the barrier layer <b>118</b> is a silicon nitride layer that is on the order of 2,000 Å to 5,000 Å in thickness. The barrier layer <b>118</b> completely surrounds the second adhesion layer <b>116</b> in some embodiments to form a fully encapsulated structure and can be formed using an LPCVD process. In addition to silicon nitride layers, amorphous materials including SiCN, SiON, AlN, SiC, and the like can be utilized as barrier layers <b>118</b>. In some implementations, the barrier layer <b>118</b> consists of a number of sub-layers that are built up to form the barrier layer <b>118</b>. Thus, the term barrier layer is not intended to denote a single layer or a single material, but to encompass one or more materials layered in a composite manner. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the barrier layer <b>118</b>, e.g., a silicon nitride layer, prevents diffusion and/or outgassing of elements present in the core, for example, yttrium (elemental), yttrium oxide (i.e., yttria), oxygen, metallic impurities, other trace elements, and the like into the environment of the semiconductor processing chambers in which the engineered substrate could be present, for example, during a high temperature (e.g., 1,000° C.) epitaxial growth process. Utilizing the encapsulating layers described herein, ceramic materials, including polycrystalline AlN that are designed for non-clean room environments, can be utilized in semiconductor process flows and clean room environments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Typically, ceramic materials utilized to form the core are fired at temperatures in the range of 1,800° C. It would be expected that this process would drive out a significant amount of impurities present in the ceramic materials. These impurities can include yttrium, which results from the use of yttria as sintering agent, calcium, and other elements and compounds. Subsequently, during epitaxial growth processes, which are conducted at much lower temperatures in the range of 800° C. to 1,100° C., it would be expected that the subsequent diffusion of these impurities would be insignificant. However, contrary to conventional expectations, the inventors have determined that even during epitaxial growth processes at temperatures much less than the firing temperature of the ceramic materials, significant diffusion of elements through the layers of the engineered substrate was present. Thus, embodiments of the present invention integrate the barrier layer <b>118</b> into the engineered substrate structure to prevent this undesirable diffusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a bonding layer <b>120</b> (e.g., a silicon oxide layer) is deposited on a portion of the barrier layer <b>118</b>, for example, the top surface of the barrier layer <b>118</b>, and subsequently used during the bonding of a substantially single crystal layer <b>125</b> (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer such as the exfoliated silicon (111) layer illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The bonding layer <b>120</b> can be approximately 1.5 μm in thickness in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the thickness of the bonding layer <b>120</b> is 20 nm or more for bond-induced void mitigation. In some embodiments, the thickness of the bonding layer <b>120</b> is in the range of 0.75-1.5 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The substantially single crystal layer <b>125</b> (e.g., exfoliated Si (111)) is suitable for use as a growth layer during an epitaxial growth process for the formation of epitaxial materials.

In an embodiment, the substantially single crystal layer <b>125</b> includes a single crystal silicon layer that is attached to the bonding layer <b>120</b> using a layer transfer process.</div>

In this implementation, the first adhesion layer <b>1012</b> completely encapsulates the core, but this is not required by the present invention, as discussed in additional detail with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, the first adhesion layer <b>1012</b> comprises a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) layer on the order of 1,000 Å in thickness. In other embodiments, the thickness of the first adhesion layer <b>1012</b> varies, for example, from 100 Å to 2,000 Å. Although TEOS is utilized for adhesion layers in some embodiments, other materials that provide for adhesion between later deposited layers and underlying layers or materials can be utilized according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example, SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiON, and the like adhere well to ceramic materials and provide a suitable surface for subsequent deposition, for example, of conductive materials. The first adhesion layer <b>1012</b> completely surrounds the core <b>1010</b> in some embodiments to form a fully encapsulated core and can be formed using an LPCVD process. The adhesion layer <b>1012</b> provides a surface on which subsequent layers adhere to form elements of the engineered substrate structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition to the use of LPCVD processes, furnace-based processes, and the like to form the encapsulating adhesion layer <b>1012</b>, other semiconductor processes can be utilized according to embodiments of the present invention.

In embodiments in which the conductive layer <b>1014</b> is polysilicon, the thickness of the polysilicon layer can be on the order of a few thousand angstroms, for example, 3,000 Å. In some embodiments, the polysilicon layer can be formed using an LPCVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In an embodiment, the conductive layer <b>1014</b> can be a polysilicon layer doped to provide a highly conductive material, for example, the conductive layer <b>1014</b> can be doped with boron to provide a p-type polysilicon layer. In some embodiments, the doping with boron is at a level ranging from about 1×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to provide for high conductivity. The presence of the conductive layer <b>1014</b> is useful during electrostatic chucking of the engineered substrate to semiconductor processing tools, for example tools with electrostatic chucks (ESC). The conductive layer <b>1014</b> enables rapid dechucking after processing.

In this example, the top surface of the conductive layer <b>1014</b> will be in contact with a portion of barrier layer <b>1018</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating an engineered substrate structure according to another embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a first adhesion layer <b>1112</b> is formed on at least a portion of the core <b>1110</b>, but does not encapsulate the core <b>1110</b>. In this implementation, the first adhesion layer <b>1112</b> is formed on a lower surface of the core <b>1110</b> (the backside of the core <b>1110</b>) in order to enhance the adhesion of a subsequently formed conductive layer <b>1114</b> as described more fully below. Although adhesion layer <b>1112</b> is only illustrated on the lower surface of the core <b>1110</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it will be appreciated that deposition of adhesion layer material on other portions of the core <b>1110</b> will not adversely impact the performance of the engineered substrates structure and such material can be present in various embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The conductive layer <b>1114</b> does not encapsulate the first adhesion layer <b>1112</b> and the core <b>1110</b>, but is substantially aligned with the first adhesion layer <b>1112</b>. Although the conductive layer <b>1114</b> is illustrated as extending along the bottom or backside and up a portion of the sides of the first adhesion layer <b>1112</b>, extension along the vertical side is not required by the present invention. Thus, embodiments can utilize deposition on one side of the substrate structure, masking of one side of the substrate structure, or the like. The conductive layer <b>1114</b> can be formed on a portion of one side, for example, the bottom/backside, of the first adhesion layer <b>1112</b>. The conductive <b>1114</b> layer provides for electrical conduction on one side of the engineered substrate structure, which can be advantageous in RF and high power applications. The conductive layer <b>1114</b> can include doped polysilicon as discussed in relation to the conductive layer <b>1014</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition to semiconductor-based conductive layers, in other embodiments, the conductive layer <b>1114</b> is a metallic layer, for example, 500 Å of titanium, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, depending on the implementation, one or more layers may be removed. For example, layers <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> can be removed, only leaving a single adhesion shell <b>1116</b> and the barrier layer <b>1118</b>. In another embodiment, only layer <b>1114</b> can be removed. In this embodiment, layer <b>1112</b> may also balance the stress and the wafer bow induced by layer <b>920</b>, deposited on top of layer <b>1118</b>. The construction of a substrate structure with insulating layers on the top side of Core <b>1110</b> (e.g., with only insulating layer between core <b>1110</b> and layer <b>920</b>) will provide benefits for power/RF applications, where a highly insulating substrate is desirable.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a simplified flowchart illustrating a method <b>1200</b> of fabricating an engineered substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>1200</b> can be utilized to manufacture a substrate that is CTE matched to one or more of the epitaxial layers grown on the substrate. The method <b>1200</b> includes forming a support structure by providing a polycrystalline ceramic core (<b>1210</b>), encapsulating the polycrystalline ceramic core in a first adhesion layer forming a shell (<b>1212</b>) (e.g., a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) oxide shell), and encapsulating the first adhesion layer in a conductive shell (<b>1214</b>) (e.g., a polysilicon shell). The first adhesion layer can be formed as a single layer of TEOS oxide. The conductive shell can be formed as a single layer of polysilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The method <b>1200</b> also includes encapsulating the conductive shell in a second adhesion layer (<b>1216</b>) (e.g., a second TEOS oxide shell) and encapsulating the second adhesion layer in a barrier layer shell (<b>1218</b>). The second adhesion layer can be formed as a single layer of TEOS oxide. The barrier layer shell can be formed as a single layer of silicon nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Once the support structure is formed by processes <b>1210</b>-<b>1218</b>, the method <b>1200</b> further includes joining a bonding layer (e.g., a silicon oxide layer) to the support structure (<b>1220</b>) and joining a substantially single crystal layer, for example, a single crystal silicon layer, to the silicon oxide layer (<b>1222</b>). Other substantially single crystal layers can be used according to embodiments of the present invention, including SiC, sapphire, GaN, AlN, SiGe, Ge, Diamond, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, and the like. The joining of the bonding layer can include deposition of a bonding material followed by planarization processes as described herein. In an embodiment as described below, joining the substantially single crystal layer (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer) to the bonding layer utilizes a layer transfer process in which the layer is a single crystal silicon layer that is transferred from a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the bonding layer <b>920</b> can be formed by a deposition of a thick (e.g., 4 μm thick) oxide layer followed by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process to thin the oxide to approximately 1.5 μm in thickness. The thick initial oxide serves to fill voids and surface features present on the support structure that may be present after fabrication of the polycrystalline core and continue to be present as the encapsulating layers illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are formed. The oxide layer also serves as a dielectric layer for the devices. The CMP process provides a substantially planar surface free of voids, particles, or other features, which can then be used during a wafer transfer process to bond the single crystal layer <b>922</b> (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer) to the bonding layer <b>920</b>. It will be appreciated that the bonding layer does not have to be characterized by an atomically flat surface, but should provide a substantially planar surface that will support bonding of the single crystal layer (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer) with the desired reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">A layer transfer process is used to join the single crystal layer <b>922</b> (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer) to the bonding layer <b>920</b>. In some embodiments, a silicon wafer including the substantially single crystal layer <b>922</b> (e.g., a single crystal silicon layer) is implanted to form a cleavage plane. In this embodiment, after wafer bonding, the silicon substrate can be removed along with the portion of the single crystal silicon layer below the cleavage plane, resulting in an exfoliated single crystal silicon layer. The thickness of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> can be varied to meet the specifications of various applications. Moreover, the crystal orientation of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> can be varied to meet the specifications of the application. Additionally, the doping levels and profile in the single crystal layer can be varied to meet the specifications of the particular application. In some embodiments, the depth of the implant may be adjusted to be greater than the desired final thickness of single crystal layer <b>922</b>. The additional thickness allows for the removal of the thin portion of the transferred substantially single crystal layer that is damaged, leaving behind the undamaged portion of the desired final thickness. In some embodiments, the surface roughness can be modified for high quality epitaxial growth. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the single crystal layer <b>922</b> can be thick enough to provide a high quality lattice template for the subsequent growth of one or more epitaxial layers but thin enough to be highly compliant. The single crystal layer <b>922</b> may be said to be “compliant” when the single crystal layer <b>922</b> is relatively thin such that its physical properties are less constrained and able to mimic those of the materials surrounding it with less propensity to generate crystalline defects. The compliance of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> may be inversely related to the thickness of the single crystal layer <b>922</b>. A higher compliance can result in lower defect densities in the epitaxial layers grown on the template and enable thicker epitaxial layer growth. In some embodiments, the thickness of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> may be increased by epitaxial growth of silicon on the exfoliated silicon layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, adjusting the final thickness of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> may be achieved through thermal oxidation of a top portion of an exfoliated silicon layer, followed by an oxide layer strip with hydrogen fluoride (HF) acid. For example, an exfoliated silicon layer having an initial thickness of 0.5 μm may be thermally oxidized to create a silicon dioxide layer that is about 420 nm thick. After removal of the grown thermal oxide, the remaining silicon thickness in the transferred layer may be about 53 nm. During thermal oxidation, implanted hydrogen may migrate toward the surface. Thus, the subsequent oxide layer strip may remove some damage. Also, thermal oxidation is typically performed at a temperature of 1000° C. or higher. The elevated temperature can may also repair lattice damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The silicon oxide layer formed on the top portion of the single crystal layer during thermal oxidation can be stripped using HF acid etching. The etching selectivity between silicon oxide and silicon (SiO<sub>2</sub>:Si) by HF acid may be adjusted by adjusting the temperature and concentration of the HF solution and the stoichiometry and density of the silicon oxide. Etch selectivity refers to the etch rate of one material relative to another. The selectivity of the HF solution can range from about 10:1 to about 100:1 for (SiO2:Si). A high etch selectivity may reduce the surface roughness by a similar factor from the initial surface roughness. However, the surface roughness of the resultant single crystal layer <b>122</b> may still be larger than desired. For example, a bulk Si (111) surface may have a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of less than 0.1 nm as determined by a 2 μm×2 μm atomic force microscope (AFM) scan before additional processing. In some embodiments, the desired surface roughness for epitaxial growth of gallium nitride materials on Si (111) may be, for example, less than 1 nm, less than 0.5 nm, or less than 0.2 nm, on a 30 μm×30 μm AFM scan area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">If the surface roughness of the single crystal layer <b>922</b> after thermal oxidation and oxide layer strip exceeds the desired surface roughness, additional surface smoothing may be performed. There are several methods of smoothing a silicon surface. These methods may include hydrogen annealing, laser trimming, plasma smoothing, and touch polish (e.g., CMP). These methods may involve preferential attack of high aspect ratio surface peaks. Hence, high aspect ratio features on the surface may be removed more quickly than low aspect ratio features, thus resulting in a smoother surface.</div>

Other sequences of steps may also be performed according to alternative embodiments.
