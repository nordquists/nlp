<heading id="h-0004">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, some examples according to the present invention will be described in referring to drawings. In the description of the drawings, numerals or symbols same with or similar to each other will refer to elements same with or similar to each other without overlapping explanations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The SiC single crystal alternately stacks the hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure and the face centered cubic (fcc) structure along the crystal orientation of [0001]. Depending on the combination of the stacked structures, the SiC single crystal has more than 250 poly-types. Thus, the SiC single crystal substrate exposes the hcp structure or the fcc structure in a (0001) or a (000-1) crystal plane. The specification below calls a surface that exposes the hcp structure a hcp surface, while, a surface that exposes the fcc structure is called a fcc surface. Details of the hcp surface and the fcc surface will be explained later in the specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Many documents have been reported about a surface of the SiC single crystal substrate terminated by silicon atoms or carbon atoms. However, which structures are exposed in the surface of the SiC single crystal substrate, the fcc surface or the hcp surface, has seemed to be not reported as far as inventors know.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross section of an SiC single crystal substrate viewed from a (11-20) plane, where the SiC single crystal substrate has a primary surface of a (0001) crystal plane. The SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b> provides a film <b>20</b> thereon. The SiC substrate <b>10</b> has a bond connecting a carbon (C) atom <b>16</b> with a silicon (Si) atom <b>18</b>. The 4H-SiC type alternately stacks h-sites (hexagonal site) and c-sites (cubic site) denoted as the bond <b>40</b> between carbon atom (C) and silicon atom (Si) within a rectangle surrounded by a broken line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Details of the h-sites and the c-sites will be further specifically described. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is the 4H type, three rows, A to C, are found for the bond <b>40</b>. The topmost bond <b>40</b>, where only Si atoms are indicated, exists in the C row, the second topmost bond exists in the A row, the third topmost bond exists in the B row, and the fourth topmost bond exists in the A row. The fifth topmost bond and subsequent bonds iterate this turn of the rows, C-A-B-A-C-A- . . . . That is, the c-sites provide only the A-row, while the h-sites provide the B-row and the C-row alternately appears as sandwiching the A-rows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The h-sites, that is, a site sandwiched by two sites having the same type, are called as the hexagonal close packed (hcp) stack <b>32</b>. On the other hand, the c-site accompanied with two sites sandwiching the c-site and having the types different from each other and also different from the c-site, for example, the first A-row sandwiched by the C-row in the upper side and the B-row in the lower side, or the second appearing A-site sandwiched by the B-row in the upper side and the C-row in the lower side thereof, are collectively called as the face centered cubic (fcc) stack <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In the hcp surface <b>12</b>, the topmost Si atom <b>18</b> in the row thereof overlaps with the row of the Si atom <b>18</b> in the third topmost layer. For instance, the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the topmost layer in the hcp surface <b>12</b> position in the A-row, the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the second one position in the B-row, and the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the third one also exist in the A-row. On the other hand, in the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the topmost Si atoms in the rows thereof are different from the rows of the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the third topmost layer. For instance, in the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the topmost Si atoms <b>18</b> exist in the C-row, the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the second topmost layer exist in the A-row, and the Si atoms <b>18</b> in the third topmost layer exist in the B-row. When atoms existing in the topmost layer are carbon (C), that is, when the surface is the C-polar surface, the positional relations of the C atoms <b>16</b> show the relationship same with those for the Si atoms <b>18</b>. The hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b> both become the closest packed surface. It is hard or almost impossible for the whole surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> to be flat within a range of one atom. The surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> inevitably shows steps accompanied with the hcp surfaces <b>12</b> and the fcc surfaces. The film <b>20</b> provided on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> is in contact with both of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Because the fcc stack <b>34</b> shows an inversion symmetry, while, the hcp stack <b>32</b> shows no inversion symmetry; the hcp stack <b>32</b> causes a spontaneous polarization but the fcc stack <b>34</b> causes no spontaneous polarization. This means that charge density on the hcp surface <b>12</b> becomes different from the charge density on the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Inhomogeneous charge density results in non-uniform distribution in electric fields, which causes a non-uniform Schottky barrier height, local variation in the threshold voltage of a MOSFET, and/or reduction of carrier mobility because of increased scattering of the carrier in the channel of the MOS FET or in an active layer grown on the SiC substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">One of types of the SiC single crystal often denoted as 3C-SiC type may realize a structure where the film <b>20</b> is in contact with only the fcc surface <b>14</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross section of an SiC structure having the 3C-SiC type. The SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b> provides, from the topmost surface thereof, C-row, A-row, B-row, C-row, and so on. That is, 3C-SiC type has a structure iterating three (3) rows, A, B and C, thereby becomes the fcc stack <b>34</b>. The first numeral â3â means the iteration of rows is three, while, the second appearing symbol âCâ means the fcc stack <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Another type denoted as the 2H-SiC provides only the hcp surface <b>12</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where the 2H-SiC type iterates two rows, A and C, and has the hcp stack <b>32</b>. The first appearing symbol â2â means the iteration of two rows, while, the second appearing symbol âHâ means the hcp structure. The film <b>20</b> may be in contact with only one type of the surface, namely, the hcp surface <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">However, the former type, 3C-SiC, shows relatively smaller bandgap energy, accordingly, it is inadequate for forming a device with a high breakdown voltage and also for an application where a substrate with high resistivity is required. Also, the latter type, 2H-SiC, is hard to produce with enough reproducibility. A SiC substrate with types of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC are preferably available in the field; but these types stack the h-sites and the c-sites by a predetermined order. In such types, it is hard or impossible to get the topmost surface flat enough within one atomic range and have only one type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention provides an SiC substrate with a film provided thereon, where the SiC substrate has only one type, the fcc surface or the hcp surface, but has substantial steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, embodiment of the present invention will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">First Embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross section of an SiC structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention where the SiC substrate has a symmetry of 4H and an fcc surface. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first embodiment provides a film <b>20</b> on the (0001) surface of the substrate made of SiC single crystal. The order of the sites in the SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b> is same with that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the c-site and the h-site are arranged alternately. Steps appear in every two sites. The surface of the SiC substrates <b>10</b> appears the fcc surface <b>14</b> and the film <b>20</b> is in contact with the fcc surface <b>14</b> but apart from the hcp surface <b>12</b>.

The surface <b>10</b> of the SiC substrate has the hcp surface <b>12</b>, and the film <b>20</b> is in contact with the hcp surface <b>12</b> but apart from the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Other arrangements of the SiC structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are substantially same with those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the 4H-SiC substrate may select the fcc surface <b>14</b> and the hcp surface <b>12</b> by forming the steps in every two atomic layers or every even number of atomic layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross section of the SiC structure having a 6H-SiC substrate whose surface is the fcc surface, which is according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The single crystal SiC substrate <b>10</b> arranges the sites in the order of A-B-C-A-C-B-A-B from the top surface thereof. Thus, the 6H-SiC alternately arranges two c-sites and one h-site and the steps appears in every three atomic layers. The SiC substrate has the fcc surface <b>14</b> and the film <b>20</b> is in contact with the fcc surface <b>14</b> but apart from the hcp surface <b>12</b>.</div>

The SiC substrate <b>10</b> shows the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the film <b>20</b> is in contact with the hcp surface by apart from the fcc surface <b>12</b>. Other arrangements are substantially same with those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another cross section of the SiC structure with the 6H-SiC substrate whose surface shows only the fcc surface.

The surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> appears the fcc surface <b>14</b>, and the film <b>20</b> is in contact with the fcc surface <b>14</b> but apart from the hcp surface <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, by forming the steps in every three or multiples of three atomic layers, the top surface may become only one of the fcc surface <b>14</b> and the hcp surface <b>12</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, combining steps in every two atomic layers and a single atomic layer, the fcc surface <b>14</b> may appear in the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The first embodiment provides the SiC single crustal substrate that includes both the fcc stack <b>32</b> and the hcp stack <b>34</b>, like the 4H-SiC substrate and/or 6H-SiC substrate, and the film <b>20</b> made of material except for SiC. The surface of the SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b>, with which the film is in contact, exposes only one of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the SiC substrate <b>10</b> may make the surface electrical potential uniform. For instance, when a MOSFET is formed with a gate insulating layer made of film <b>20</b>, such a surface with a uniform electrical potential distribution may suppress localized variation in a threshold voltage of the MOSFET. When the film <b>20</b> is a Schottky metal, Schottky barrier height may be controlled. Also, carrier scattering due to the electrical potential distribution in the channel of a MOSFET or in the film <b>20</b> on the SiC substrate <b>10</b>, for instance, a graphene layer, may be suppressed, which means the carrier mobility increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The SiC single crystal layer may be the SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b> itself or a SiC layer grown on the substrate <b>10</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> show, the surface of the SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b> exposes the fcc surface <b>14</b> or the hcp surface <b>12</b> even through the substrate <b>10</b> has a stepped surface. Accordingly, the device formed on the substrate <b>10</b> may use the 4H-SiC substrate or 6H-SiC substrate where those structures are easy to be produced. Also, the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> may easily reproduce the type of the surfaces without being bound the various phases of the SiC single crystal.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The second embodiment according to the present invention relates to a process of forming the SiC structure; specifically, the process of forming the fcc surface <b>14</b> of the SiC substrate by etching. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show cross sections of the SiC structure at respective steps of the process in the second embodiment. As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates, The SiC substrate <b>10</b>, which has the 4H-SiC structure, alternately stacks c-sites and h-sites, where they are called as, from the side of the top surface, c<b>1</b>, h<b>1</b>, c<b>2</b>, h<b>2</b>, c<b>3</b>, . . . , and so on. Only one dangling bond for the respective atoms appears in the surface so as to minimize the energy. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, Si atoms appear in the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>. Although not explicitly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the back surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> appears C atoms. Also, when Si atoms <b>18</b> and C atoms <b>16</b> are opposite, the top surface of the substrate <b>10</b> appears C atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Because the SiC substrate <b>10</b> in surface thereof is not completely flat; steps appear in the surface thereof. Sides of the steps expose carbon atoms <b>16</b> or silicon atoms <b>18</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the topmost step exposes carbon atom <b>16</b>, which will be called as the C-step. The upper side in the first c-site c <b>1</b> becomes the C-step, while, the lower one also becomes the C-step, which is the higher side of the first h-site h<b>1</b>. The lower side of h<b>1</b> site becomes the Si-step, which is the higher one of the second c-site c<b>2</b>. Thus, the upper and the lower sides of the c-sites become the same type of the step, while, those of the h-sites become the types different from each other. The 4H-SiC substrate alternates two C-steps and two Si-steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">It is known in the field that surface energy Ec of the C-step is higher than surface energy E<sub>Si </sub>of the Si-step. For instance, Journal of Crystal Growth published in 1984 in pages 30 to 40 of volume 70 has reported this fact. Accordingly, etching the SiC substrate <b>10</b>, or exposing the surface thereof in an oxidizing atmosphere, the C-steps are primarily etched or oxidized as shown in arrows indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. Accordingly, the C-steps approach the Si-steps and finally overlap with the Si-steps, which are often called as the step bunching. When the C-steps in the upper and lower sides of the c<b>1</b>-site are promptly etched, which accelerates the etching of the upper side of the h<b>1</b>-site, the fcc surface <b>14</b> is left on the topmost surface of the SiC substrate, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. This mechanism may be similarly applicable to other poly-types such as the 6H-SiC structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The velocity v<sub>Si</sub>, or the etching rate, of the Si-step and that of the C-step are denoted as v<sub>Si</sub>=AÃexp(âE<sub>Si</sub>/k/T) and v<sub>C</sub>=BÃexp(âE<sub>C</sub>/k/T), respectively where A and B are constants, k is a Boltzmann constant, and T is an absolute temperature. In order to get the fcc surface <b>14</b>, a ratio of the velocity vc against the velocity v<sub>Si </sub>is preferably larger; that is, v<sub>C</sub>/v<sub>Si</sub>=A/BÃexp((E<sub>Si</sub>âE<sub>C</sub>)/k/T) becomes larger. Accordingly, the temperature T of the process is preferably set lower. However, a lower temperature T decreases absolutes of the velocities, vc and vsi. Thus, the temperature of the process is necessary to be determined taking a process time, namely, etching time of the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">An example to obtain the fcc surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> will be explained by exposing the SiC substrate <b>10</b> in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere. When the temperature of the exposure exceeds 1500Â° C., the etching velocity vc of the C-step and that v<sub>Si </sub>becomes comparable. The process first prepares a 4H-SiC substrate with (0001) crystal surface as the topmost surface. This SiC substrate <b>10</b> is exposed in H<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at a temperature of 500Â° C. Under such a temperature, the C-step is promptly etched compared with the Si-step as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, but the C-step is not etched beyond the Si-step; that is, the etching of the C-step is substantially stopped when the C-step becomes aligned with the Si-step. Thus, the SiC substrate <b>10</b> forms the topmost surface thereof as the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Thereafter, a film <b>20</b> is deposited on the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> by, for instance, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, where the film <b>20</b> may be made of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), graphene, and so on. Thus, an SiC structure with the film shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The process described above may be similarly applicable to another SiC substrate with the 6H-SiC type. Also, the temperature for exposing H<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere is preferably lower than 600Â° C. Oppositely, in order to shorten the process time with securing substantial etching, the process temperature is preferably higher than 300Â° C. The H<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere may contain inactive gases of, for instance, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), helium (He), argon (Ar), neon (Ne), xenon (Xe), and mixtures of those gases. The H<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere in a pressure thereof is not restricted to an atmospheric pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Third Embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The third embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of forming the fcc surface <b>14</b> on the SiC substrate by growing the SiC. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show cross sections of the process of forming the fcc surface. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows, similar to those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the C-steps and the Si-steps in the topmost surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. Because the C-step has the surface energy E<sub>C </sub>higher than that E<sub>Si </sub>of the Si-step, the C-steps easier grow compared with the Si-steps, as shown in arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Performing the epitaxial growth that controls the steps, which is disclosed in the second non-patent document, the C-steps may be promptly grown compared with the Si-steps until the C-steps become aligned with the Si-steps. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the c<b>1</b>-site and the h<b>1</b>-site dominantly grow and the fcc surface <b>14</b> appears in the topmost surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. This mechanism may be similarly applicable to the other poly-types such as the 6H-SiC type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The growth velocity r<sub>Si </sub>of the Si-step is denoted as r<sub>Si</sub>=Î±Ãexp (âE<sub>Si</sub>/k/T), while, that r<sub>C </sub>of the C-step is denoted as r<sub>C</sub>=Î²Ãexp (âE<sub>C</sub>/k/T), where Î± and Î² are constants, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is an absolute temperature. In order to obtain the fcc surface <b>14</b>, a ratio of the former velocity r<sub>C </sub>against the latter one r<sub>Si </sub>is preferably larger, that is, r<sub>C</sub>/r<sub>Si</sub>=Î±/Î²Ãexp(âE<sub>Si</sub>âE<sub>C</sub>)/k/T) becomes larger. Similar to the aforementioned embodiment, the process temperature is preferably lowered to enhance the ratio. However, a lower process temperature T results in reduction of the absolute growth rate of the C-step and the Si-step. Also, a lower growth temperature causes inferior quality of grown layers. Accordingly, the growth temperature of the C-step is necessary to be determined taking those effects into account.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">An example will be described. The process first prepares a 4H-SiC substrate whose topmost surface is inclined to the [11-20] crystal orientation from (0001) surface. Such an inclined surface causes steps in the topmost surface. Growing SiC layer on such a surface at a temperature of 1650Â° C. by the aforementioned step controlling epitaxy and flowing silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>), and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by respective flow rates of 20 sccm, 13 sccm, and 2 slm, the SiC layer is epitaxially grown on the SiC substrate <b>10</b>. Because the C-step promptly grows laterally on the surface compared with the Si-step, and the lateral growth of the C-step effectively stops when it is aligned with the Si-step, the SiC substrate <b>10</b> shows the fcc surface <b>14</b> on the topmost thereof, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Thereafter, the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> thus processed is covered with the film <b>20</b> to form the SiC structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In an alternative, the process prepares a SiC substrate with a topmost surface thereof inclined by 4Â° toward [11-20] crystal orientation from (0001) surface thereof. Similar to the process above described, the step controlling epitaxy may grow the SiC layer so as to form the fcc surface <b>14</b> in the topmost thereof. Covering the topmost surface of the SiC substrate with the film <b>20</b>, the SiC structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The growth temperature for the SiC layer is preferably lower than 1700Â° C. to enhance the ratio r<sub>C</sub>/r<sub>Si </sub>of the growth rates for the C-step and the Si-step, respectively. Also, from absolute growth rates thereof, the growth temperature is preferably higher than 1450Â° C. Flow rates of the source gases of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>), and that of the carrier gas of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) may be optional.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, the second embodiment and the third embodiment may form the topmost surface of the SiC single crystal substrate <b>10</b>, which contains both the hexagonal close packed cells and the face centered cubic unit cells, having only one of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b>. The topmost surface of the substrate <b>10</b> thus formed may appear the fcc surface <b>14</b>. The topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> becomes the Si-polar surface because of lowered surface energy of silicon (Si) compared with carbon (C). Covering this topmost surface by the film <b>20</b> so as to be in direct contact therewith, the SiC structure of the first embodiment may be obtained. The topmost surface of the film <b>20</b> becomes parallel to the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The process has an etching condition where one of the C-step and the Si-step may be promptly etched compared with the other of the C-step and the Si-step. Thus, the process may form the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> exposing only one of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b>. The etching temperature for the SiC substrate <b>10</b> is preferably between 300 to 600Â° C. Also, the process has a growth condition where one of the C-step and the Si-step promptly grows compared with the other of the C-step and the Si-step, which may also form the topmost surface of the SiC substrate having only one of the hcp surface and the fcc surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Fourth Embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The fourth embodiment according to the present invention relates to a process of forming a graphene layer on a SiC substrate. Sublimating Si on the topmost of the SiC substrate by a process disclosed in the first non-patent document, a graphene layer may be formed on the SiC substrate. Forming an odd number of graphene layers on the 4H-SiC substrate <b>10</b> whose topmost surface is the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> becomes the hcp surface <b>12</b>. Also, forming an even number of graphene layers on the 4H-SiC substrate <b>10</b> whose topmost surface is the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the topmost surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> becomes the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Thus, a graphene layer <b>20</b> may be formed on the SiC substrate <b>10</b> with the fcc surface <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The number of graphene layers depends on the sublimation of Si atoms from the SiC surface. The sublimation of Si atoms may be suppressed as the temperature becomes lower and the vapor pressure of Si becomes lower. Accordingly, precisely controlled temperature and the Si vapor pressure in atmosphere may form a mono layer or double layers of the graphene on the SiC substrate <b>10</b>. Forming the mono layer of the graphene on the 4H-SiC substrate <b>10</b> with the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the graphene in contact with the hcp surface <b>12</b> may be obtained; while, forming the double layer of the graphene on the 4H-SiC substrate <b>10</b> with the fcc surface <b>14</b>, the graphene in contact with the fcc surface <b>14</b> may be obtained. Thus, the carrier mobility within the graphene increases because of a uniform distribution of the electrical field within the SiC substrate <b>10</b>. Also, the graphene may enhance the quality thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Such a graphene may be obtained by exposing the SiC substrate <b>10</b> at a temperature of 1600Â° C. within argon (Ar) atmosphere; that is, the sublimation of Si atoms may be carried out at the temperature of 1600Â° C. Temperatures from 1600 to 1800Â° C. may be applicable for forming the graphene. Also, the sublimation may be carried out within an atmosphere of, not only Ar, but nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and other noble and inactive gases, or within a vacuum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">A graphene formed by the sublimation of Si atoms may enhance the layer quality, or may reduce defected induced within the formed graphene. Also, the formed graphene is in contact with only one of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b> of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>, which makes the surface distribution of the electrical field homogeneous in the SiC substrate <b>10</b> and enhances the carrier mobility in the graphene.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The fifth embodiment according to the present invention relates to a process of forming a film on the hcp surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11D</figref> shows cross sections of the structure at respective steps of the process. The process first forms the fcc surface <b>14</b> of the 4H-SiC substrate <b>10</b> by techniques of the second or the third embodiment. Sublimating Si atoms on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b>, the graphene layer <b>22</b>, which has an odd number of layers, is formed on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>.

<heading id="h-0005">EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">An example of obtaining an SiC substrate having only one type, the fcc surface or the hcp surface, but accompanied with substantial steps will be described. An SiC substrate with the 4H-SiC type, where the SiC substrate had the Si-polar surface, was first treated in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) under conditions of: within a pure hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) without any noble or inert gases at an atmospheric pressure, a temperature of 500Â° C., and a period of 300 minutes. A surface of the sample was compared before and after the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) treatment by the atomic force microscope (AFM). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> compare the sample before and after the treatment. Images shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> are within a range of 10 Î¼m square. The sample before the treatment shows no steps in an atomic scale. The average surface roughness Ra, which is an average of squares of unevenness within a preset length, was 11.48 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Although the surface after the treatment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, caused steps in the atomic scale; average roughness of the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> was 0.416 nm. The steps had a height of about 1 nm, which corresponded to a length of two bonds between Si and C atoms in the (0001) crystal plane. Accordingly, the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> had only one of the hcp surface <b>12</b> and the fcc surface <b>14</b>. Because the steps ran substantially parallel to each other, the steps were seemed to be the Si step because of lower surface energy. Thus, the SiC substrate <b>10</b> thus treated within the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) had only the fcc surface <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, a graphene was formed on the SiC substrates one of which was not treated in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), while, the other was treated in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). The graphene was formed by exposing the SiC substrates in conditions of: argon (Ar) atmosphere in an atmospheric pressure, a temperature of 1600Â° C., and a period of 10 minutes. The Raman spectroscopy took two peeks, one of which was the G-band around 1590 cm<sup>â1</sup>, while, the other was the D-band around 1350 cm<sup>â1</sup>, where the former peak is due to the sp2 bond of carbon (C) atoms forming the six-membered ring, while, the latter corresponds to a case when the six-membered ring forms a dangling bond, namely, the imperfect six-membered ring. When a ratio of the latter peak against the former peak D/G increases, defects involved in the graphene become larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> are two dimensional mapping within 500 Î¼m square of the ratio D/G for the sample without the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) treatment and with the treatment, respectively. As the scale in the side of the mappings indicates, a darker area corresponds to a smaller ratio, while, a lighter area corresponds to a larger ratio. The sample without the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) treatment indicated lighter area, namely, larger ratios with an average of 86.3%. On the other hand, the sample with the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) treatment indicated darker areas with an average of 41.7%. Thus, the sample with the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) treatment decreases defects in the graphene, which is due to the uniformity of the close packed structure in the surface of the SiC substrate <b>10</b> and accordingly, the growth rate and/or the orientation of the growth become homogeneous within the surface of the SiC substrate.</div>
