<div class="abstract">A single crystal semiconductor handle substrate for use in the manufacture of semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator (SOI)) structure is etched to form a porous layer in the front surface region of the wafer. The etched region is oxidized and then filled with a semiconductor material, which may be polycrystalline or amorphous. The surface is polished to render it bondable to a semiconductor donor substrate. Layer transfer is performed over the polished surface thus creating semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator (SOI)) structure having 4 layers: the handle substrate, the composite layer comprising filled pores, a dielectric layer (e.g., buried oxide), and a device layer. The structure can be used as initial substrate in fabricating radiofrequency chips. The resulting chips have suppressed parasitic effects, particularly, no induced conductive channel below the buried oxide.</div>

<heading id="h-0002">THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the field of semiconductor wafer manufacture. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a handle substrate for use in the manufacture of a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure, and more particularly to a method for producing a charge trapping layer in the handle wafer of the semiconductor-on-insulator structure.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor wafers are generally prepared from a single crystal ingot (e.g., a silicon ingot) which is trimmed and ground to have one or more flats or notches for proper orientation of the wafer in subsequent procedures. The ingot is then sliced into individual wafers. While reference will be made herein to semiconductor wafers constructed from silicon, other materials may be used to prepare semiconductor wafers, such as germanium, silicon carbide, silicon germanium, gallium arsenide, and other alloys of Group III and Group V elements, such as gallium nitride or indium phosphide, or alloys of Group II and Group IV elements, such as cadmium sulfide or zinc oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor wafers (e.g., silicon wafers) may be utilized in the preparation of composite layer structures. A composite layer structure (e.g., a semiconductor-on-insulator, and more specifically, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structure) generally comprises a handle wafer or layer, a device layer, and an insulating (i.e., dielectric) film (typically an oxide layer) between the handle layer and the device layer. Generally, the device layer is between 0.01 and 20 micrometers thick, such as between 0.05 and 20 micrometers thick. Thick film device layers may have a device layer thickness between about 1.5 micrometers and about 20 micrometers. Thin film device layers may have a thickness between about 0.01 micrometer and about 0.20 micrometer. In general, composite layer structures, such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), and silicon-on-quartz, are produced by placing two wafers in intimate contact, thereby initiating bonding by van der Waal's forces, followed by a thermal treatment to strengthen the bond. The anneal may convert the terminal silanol groups to siloxane bonds between the two interfaces, thereby strengthening the bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">After thermal anneal, the bonded structure undergoes further processing to remove a substantial portion of the donor wafer to achieve layer transfer. For example, wafer thinning techniques, e.g., etching or grinding, may be used, often referred to as back etch SOI (i.e., BESOI), wherein a silicon wafer is bound to the handle wafer and then slowly etched away until only a thin layer of silicon on the handle wafer remains. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,189,500, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. This method is time-consuming and costly, wastes one of the substrates and generally does not have suitable thickness uniformity for layers thinner than a few microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Another common method of achieving layer transfer utilizes a hydrogen implant followed by thermally induced layer splitting. Particles (atoms or ionized atoms, e.g., hydrogen atoms or a combination of hydrogen and helium atoms) are implanted at a specified depth beneath the front surface of the donor wafer. The implanted particles form a cleave plane in the donor wafer at the specified depth at which they were implanted. The surface of the donor wafer is cleaned to remove organic compounds or other contaminants, such as boron compounds, deposited on the wafer during the implantation process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The front surface of the donor wafer is then bonded to a handle wafer to form a bonded wafer through a hydrophilic bonding process. Prior to bonding, the donor wafer and/or handle wafer are activated by exposing the surfaces of the wafers to plasma containing, for example, oxygen or nitrogen. Exposure to the plasma modifies the structure of the surfaces in a process often referred to as surface activation, which activation process renders the surfaces of one or both of the donor water and handle wafer hydrophilic. The surfaces of the wafers can be additionally chemically activated by a wet treatment, such as an SC1 clean or hydrofluoric acid. The wet treatment and the plasma activation may occur in either order, or the wafers may be subjected to only one treatment. The wafers are then pressed together, and a bond is formed there between. This bond is relatively weak, due to van der Waal's forces, and must be strengthened before further processing can occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In some processes, the hydrophilic bond between the donor wafer and handle wafer (i.e., a bonded wafer) is strengthened by heating or annealing the bonded wafer pair. In some processes, wafer bonding may occur at low temperatures, such as between approximately 300° C. and 500° C. The elevated temperatures cause the formation of covalent bonds between the adjoining surfaces of the donor wafer and the handle wafer, thus solidifying the bond between the donor wafer and the handle wafer. Concurrently with the heating or annealing of the bonded wafer, the particles earlier implanted in the donor wafer weaken the cleave plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A portion of the donor wafer is then separated (i.e., cleaved) along the cleave plane from the bonded wafer to form the SOI wafer. Cleaving may be carried out by placing the bonded wafer in a fixture in which mechanical force is applied perpendicular to the opposing sides of the bonded wafer in order to pull a portion of the donor wafer apart from the bonded wafer. According to some methods, suction cups are utilized to apply the mechanical force. The separation of the portion of the donor wafer is initiated by applying a mechanical wedge at the edge of the bonded wafer at the cleave plane in order to initiate propagation of a crack along the cleave plane. The mechanical force applied by the suction cups then pulls the portion of the donor wafer from the bonded wafer, thus forming an SOI wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to other methods, the bonded pair may instead be subjected to an elevated temperature over a period of time to separate the portion of the donor wafer from the bonded wafer. Exposure to the elevated temperature causes initiation and propagation of cracks along the cleave plane, thus separating a portion of the donor wafer. The crack forms due to the formation of voids from the implanted ions, which grow by Ostwald ripening. The voids are filled with hydrogen and helium. The voids become platelets. The pressurized gases in the platelets propagate micro-cavities and micro-cracks, which weaken the silicon on the implant plane. If the anneal is stopped at the proper time, the weakened bonded wafer may be cleaved by a mechanical process. However, if the thermal treatment is continued for a longer duration and/or at a higher temperature, the micro-crack propagation reaches the level where all cracks merge along the cleave plane, thus separating a portion of the donor wafer. This method allows for better uniformity of the transferred layer and allows recycle of the donor wafer, but typically requires heating the implanted and bonded pair to temperatures approaching 500° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The use of high resistivity semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) wafers for RF related devices such as antenna switches offers benefits over traditional substrates in terms of cost and integration. To reduce parasitic power loss and minimize harmonic distortion inherent when using conductive substrates for high frequency applications it is necessary, but not sufficient, to use substrate wafers with a high resistivity. Accordingly, the resistivity of the handle wafer for an RF device is generally greater than about 500 Ohm-cm. With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon on insulator structure <b>2</b> comprising a very high resistivity silicon wafer <b>4</b>, a buried oxide (BOX) layer <b>6</b>, and a silicon device layer <b>10</b>. Such a substrate is prone to formation of high conductivity charge inversion or accumulation layers <b>12</b> at the BOX/handle interface causing generation of free carriers (electrons or holes), which reduce the effective resistivity of the substrate and give rise to parasitic power losses and device nonlinearity when the devices are operated at RF frequencies. These inversion/accumulation layers can be due to BOX fixed charge, oxide trapped charge, interface trapped charge, and even DC bias applied to the devices themselves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">A method is required therefore to trap the charge in any induced inversion or accumulation layers so that the high resistivity of the substrate is maintained even in the very near surface region. It is known that charge trapping layers (CTL) between the high resistivity handle substrates and the buried oxide (BOX) may improve the performance of RF devices fabricated using SOI wafers. A number of methods have been suggested to form these high interface trap layers. For example, with reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one of the method of creating a semiconductor-on-insulator <b>20</b> (e.g., a silicon-on-insulator, or SOI) with a CTL for RF device applications is based on depositing an undoped polycrystalline silicon film <b>28</b> on a silicon substrate having high resistivity <b>22</b> and then forming a stack of oxide <b>24</b> and top silicon layer <b>26</b> on it. A polycrystalline silicon layer <b>28</b> acts as a high defectivity layer between the silicon substrate <b>22</b> and the buried oxide layer <b>24</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which depicts a polycrystalline silicon film for use as a charge trapping layer <b>28</b> between a high resistivity substrate <b>22</b> and the buried oxide layer <b>24</b> in a silicon-on-insulator structure <b>20</b>. An alternative method is the implantation of heavy ions to create a near surface damage layer. Devices, such as radiofrequency devices, are built in the top silicon layer <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">It has been shown in academic studies that the polycrystalline silicon layer in between of the oxide and substrate improves the device isolation, decreases transmission line losses and reduces harmonic distortions. See, for example: H. S. Gamble, et al. “Low-loss CPW lines on surface stabilized high resistivity silicon,” <i>Microwave Guided Wave Lett., </i>9(10), pp. 395-397, 1999; D. Lederer, R. Lobet and J.-P. Raskin, “Enhanced high resistivity SOI wafers for RF applications,” <i>IEEE Intl. SOI Conf</i>, pp. 46-47, 2004; D. Lederer and J.-P. Raskin, “New substrate passivation method dedicated to high resistivity SOI wafer fabrication with increased substrate resistivity,” <i>IEEE Electron Device Letters</i>, vol. 26, no. 11, pp. 805-807, 2005; D. Lederer, B. Aspar, C. Laghaé and J.-P. Raskin, “Performance of RF passive structures and SOI MOSFETs transferred on a passivated HR SOI substrate,” <i>IEEE International SOI Conference</i>, pp. 29-30, 2006; and Daniel C. Kerr et al. “Identification of RF harmonic distortion on Si substrates and its reduction using a trap-rich layer”, Silicon Monolithic Integrated Circuits in RF Systems, 2008.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The properties of polycrystalline silicon charge trapping layer depends upon the thermal treatments the semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) receives. A problem that arises with these methods is that the defect density in the layer and interface tend to anneal out and become less effective at charge trapping as the wafers are subjected to the thermal processes required to make the wafers and build devices on them. Accordingly, the effectiveness of polycrystalline silicon CTL depends on the thermal treatments that SOI receives. In practice, the thermal budget of SOI fabrication and device processing is so high that the charge traps in conventional polycrystalline silicon are essentially eliminated. The charge trapping efficiency of these films becomes very poor.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S) OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, a method is provided for producing a charge trapping layer on a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate, e.g., a single crystal semiconductor handle wafer, such as a single crystal silicon handle wafer. The single crystal semiconductor handle wafer comprising the charge trapping layer is useful in the production of a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure. According to the present invention, the charge trapping layer in the single crystal semiconductor handle wafer is formed at the region near the oxide interface. Advantageously, the method of the present invention provides a charge trapping layer that is stable against thermal processing, such as subsequent thermal process steps in the production of the semiconductor-on-insulator substrate and device manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments of the present invention, and with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b> (i.e., a single crystal silicon handle substrate) is prepared for use in manufacture of a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b> is etched to form a porous layer <b>44</b> in the front surface region of the substrate <b>42</b>. The etching process increases the exposed surface area in the front surface region of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b> is electrochemically etched to form a porous layer in the front surface region of the substrate. Upon drying and exposure of the etched surface to an ambient atmosphere comprising oxygen (e.g., air), the exposed, etched surface of the porous film is oxidized. Exposure to air upon drying may be, in some embodiments, sufficient oxidation of the surfaces of the pores. In some embodiments, the pores may be anodically oxidized or thermally oxidized. In some embodiments, the etched porous region, optionally comprising an oxide film, is filled with semiconductor material. In some embodiments, the etched porous region, optionally comprising an oxide film, is filled with semiconductor material of the same type as the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate. In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate comprises a single crystal silicon handle substrate, and the etched, porous region is filled with silicon. In some embodiments, polycrystalline silicon is deposited to fill pores in the porous layer. In some embodiments, amorphous silicon is deposited to fill pores in the porous layer. In some embodiments, the etched, porous region may be oxidized to thereby fill the pores with semiconductor oxide, e.g., silicon dioxide. The surface of the structure comprising the filled pores may be polished to make the surface bondable. For example, the filled structure may comprise an excess layer of fill material on the front surface of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate. The excess layer of fill material may be polished to thereby render the front surface of the handle substrate bondable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The resulting handle substrate <b>42</b> is suitable for use in the manufacture of a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure <b>40</b>. Layer transfer is performed over the polished surface thus creating a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure <b>40</b> comprising the handle substrate <b>42</b>, the composite layer comprising the filled pores <b>44</b>, a dielectric layer <b>46</b> (e.g., buried oxide), and a single crystal semiconductor device layer <b>48</b> (e.g., a silicon layer derived from a single crystal silicon donor substrate). The semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure <b>40</b> of the present invention may be used as an initial substrate in fabricating radiofrequency chips. Resulting chips have suppressed parasitic effects. In particular, a semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) structure <b>40</b> comprising handle substrates <b>42</b> prepared according to the method of the present invention have no induced conductive channel below the buried oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the method of the present invention, a composite film <b>44</b> in the front surface region of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b> is obtained by fabricating a porous layer, oxidizing the exposed walls of the pores, and refilling the pores with deposited semiconductor (e.g., silicon) or by refilling the pores with semiconductor oxide (e.g., silicon dioxide). The resulting composite film <b>44</b> is suitable for use as a thermally stable trap rich layer in SOI wafer. The thermal stability is a fundamental difference between a regular polycrystalline silicon, which is a conventional charge trapping layer, and the composite film <b>44</b> in present invention. In this regard, annealing a structure comprising a conventional charge trapping layer, which may occur during subsequent thermal process steps, drives the system to a lower free energy state. When polycrystalline silicon is the charge trapping layer, there is energy associated with grain boundaries, which get minimized through minimizing area of the grain boundaries. This lowers the overall effectiveness of polycrystalline silicon as a charge trapping layer. When a composite film of the present invention is prepared as a charge trapping layer, the oxide walls divide the film into grains, and coarsening requires dissolving of the walls. This requires higher that 1100° C. temperatures. Accordingly, the composite film in the front surface region of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate is thermally stable in the desired temperature range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The substrates for use in the present invention include a semiconductor handle substrate, e.g., a single crystal semiconductor handle wafer and a semiconductor donor substrate, e.g., a single crystal semiconductor donor wafer. The semiconductor device layer <b>48</b> in a semiconductor-on-insulator composite structure <b>40</b> is derived from the single crystal semiconductor donor wafer. The semiconductor device layer <b>48</b> may be transferred onto the semiconductor handle substrate <b>42</b> by wafer thinning techniques such as etching a semiconductor donor substrate or by cleaving a semiconductor donor substrate comprising a damage plane. In general, the single crystal semiconductor handle wafer and single crystal semiconductor donor wafer comprise two major, generally parallel surfaces. One of the parallel surfaces is a front surface of the substrate, and the other parallel surface is a back surface of the substrate. The substrates comprise a circumferential edge joining the front and back surfaces, a bulk region between the front and back surfaces, and a central plane between the front and back surfaces. The substrates additionally comprise an imaginary central axis perpendicular to the central plane and a radial length that extends from the central axis to the circumferential edge. In addition, because semiconductor substrates, e.g., silicon wafers, typically have some total thickness variation (TTV), warp, and bow, the midpoint between every point on the front surface and every point on the back surface may not precisely fall within a plane. As a practical matter, however, the TTV, warp, and bow are typically so slight that to a close approximation the midpoints can be said to fall within an imaginary central plane which is approximately equidistant between the front and back surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Prior to any operation as described herein, the front surface and the back surface of the substrate may be substantially identical. A surface is referred to as a “front surface” or a “back surface” merely for convenience and generally to distinguish the surface upon which the operations of method of the present invention are performed. In the context of the present invention, a “front surface” of a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate, e.g., a single crystal silicon handle wafer, refers to the major surface of the substrate that becomes an interior surface of the bonded structure. It is upon this front surface that the charge trapping layer is formed. Additionally, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate may be considered as having a front surface region having a depth, D, as measured from the front surface of the handle substrate and toward the central plane. The length of D defines the depth of the porous composite layer region <b>44</b> formed according to the method of the present invention. The depth, D, may vary between about 0.1 micrometer and about 50 micrometers, such as between about 0.3 micrometer and about 20 micrometers, such as between about 1 micrometer and about 10 micrometers, such as between about 1 micrometer and about 5 micrometers, as measured from the front surface of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate toward the central plane. A “back surface” of a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate, e.g., a handle wafer, refers to the major surface that becomes an exterior surface of the bonded structure. Similarly, a “front surface” of a single crystal semiconductor donor substrate, e.g., a single crystal silicon donor wafer, refers to the major surface of the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate that becomes an interior surface of the bonded structure. The front surface of a single crystal semiconductor donor substrate often comprises a dielectric layer <b>46</b> comprising one or more insulating layers. The dielectric layer <b>46</b> may comprise a silicon dioxide layer, which forms the buried oxide (BOX) layer in the final structure <b>40</b>. A “back surface” of a single crystal semiconductor donor substrate, e.g., a single crystal silicon donor wafer, refers to the major surface that becomes an exterior surface of the bonded structure. Upon completion of conventional bonding and wafer thinning steps, the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate forms the semiconductor device layer <b>48</b> of the semiconductor-on-insulator (e.g., silicon-on-insulator) composite structure <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The single crystal semiconductor handle substrate and the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate may be single crystal semiconductor wafers.

High resistivity wafers may comprise electrically active dopants, such as boron (p type), gallium (p type), aluminum (p type), indium (p type), phosphorus (n type), antimony (n type), and arsenic (n type), in generally very low concentrations. Cz-grown silicon wafers may be subjected to a thermal anneal at a temperature ranging from about 600° C. to about 1000° C. in order to annihilate thermal donors caused by oxygen that are incorporated during crystal growth.

(St. Peters, Mo.; formerly MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle wafer surface could be intentionally damaged by an abrasive blasting process or by a caustic etch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Due to use of a high resistivity semiconductor, e.g., high resistivity silicon, as the handle substrate material, in some embodiments, a p-type dopant may be implanted into a region on the backside of the handle substrate prior to the formation of porous silicon to promote the formation of holes necessary for the formation of porous silicon. This can be accomplished by implanting dopants, such as boron, a shallow depth on the backside of the wafer and subjecting the wafer to an implant anneal. The depth of the implant is sufficiently shallow and the thickness of the wafer sufficiently large that over the course of thermal processing of the multilayer semiconductor-on-insulator structure, e.g., silicon on insulator, in the device fabrication line that the dopant does not diffuse close enough to the charge trapping layer interface to lower the resistivity of the silicon in that region, which is necessary for good RF performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">For very high resistivity n-type handle substrates, backside illumination may be required to produce holes for the formation of porous silicon. In some embodiments, low doped n-type wafers are used in this application, and illumination from backside can be advantageously used to control the average porous diameter. Without the illumination, the pores might have excessive diameter above 100 nm. For n-type doped silicon, both pore size and inter-pore spacing can be lowered to about 5 nm, and the pore network typically looks very homogeneous and interconnected. With increasing illumination, pore sizes and inter-pore spacing increase, while the specific surface area decreases. The structure becomes anisotropic, with long voids running perpendicular to the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the front surface of the semiconductor handle wafer is treated to form a porous layer. The porous layer may be formed by contacting the front surface of a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate with an etching solution. In some embodiments, the etching solution comprises an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution. Alcohols, such as ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and CTEC, may be added. As porous silicon (p-Si) is produced at the anode of the cell, hydrogen gas bubbled are produced. These bubbles adhere to the surface of the growing p-Si surface. These bubbles act as masks, blocking the current flow and access of HF. Alcohols, such as ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and CTEC, help to reduce this effect. Typical electrolyte can be 1:1:1 (HF:water:alcohol), other examples are 3:1 (HF:alcohol). In some embodiments, the handle wafer is etched in a hydrofluoric acid solution electrochemically, e.g., in a Teflon cell. One such commercially available cell is the wet etching double cell for porous silicon etching available from AMMT GmbH. Electrochemical etching occurs at conditions sufficient to etch pores into a front surface region of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate. The properties of porous silicon, such as porosity, thickness, pore diameter and microstructure, depend on anodization conditions. These conditions include HF concentration, current density, wafer type and resistivity, anodization duration, illumination, temperature, and drying conditions. Choosing proper conditions to get a desired porosity and pore size is described in previous art, for example “Porous silicon: a quantum sponge structure for silicon based optoelectronics” by O. Bisi, S. Ossicini, L. Pavesi, Surface Science Reports, vol. 38 (2000) pp. 1-126. In some embodiments, the current density may range between about 5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and about 800 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the etching duration may be between about 1 minute to about 30 minutes. The bath temperature is typically maintained at room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The porosity, i.e., pore density, generally increases as the current density increases. Additionally, for a fixed current density, the porosity decreases with increasing HF concentration. With fixed HF concentration and current density, the porosity increases with thickness and porosity gradients in depth occur. This happens because of the extra chemical dissolution of porous silicon layer in HF. The thicker the layer, the longer the anodization time, and the longer the residence of Si in the HF reaches solutions, the higher the mass of chemically dissolved porous silicon. This effect is much more important for lightly doped Si, while it is almost negligible for heavily doped Si, because of the lower specific surface area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The front surface region may be etched to an average depth between about 0.1 micrometer and about 50 micrometers, such as between about 0.3 micrometer and about 20 micrometers, such as between about 1 micrometer and about 10 micrometers, such as between about 1 micrometer and about 5 micrometers, as measured from the front surface of the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate toward the bottom surfaces of the pores. Each of the pores is approximately tubular or cylindrical in shape, such as the pores comprise a bottom surface and a sidewall surface. The pore shape may vary significantly from pore to pore. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> for a depiction of a front surface region of a single crystal semiconductor handle substrate <b>100</b> comprising several pores <b>102</b>.

Pores with approximately cylindrical may be considered as having an average diameter between about 1 nanometer and about 1000 nanometers, such as between about 2 nanometer and about 200 nanometers, as measured at any point along the pore sidewall. In some embodiments, the front surface region may be characterized by a pore density, i.e., the total volume of pores as a percentage of the total volume of the front surface region between about 5% and about 80%, such as between about 5% and about 50%. In some embodiments, the front surface region may be characterized by a pore density, i.e., the total volume of pores as a percentage of the total volume of the front surface region between about 5% and about 35%, such as between about 5% and about 25%. In one specific embodiment, a wafer may be electrochemically etched in a solution of 50% ethanol/50% hydrofluoric acid (48 wt %) with current density 20 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and rinsed afterward in deionized water. The etching time ranges from 1 to 20 min, thus resulting in layer thicknesses between about 0.3 to 1.5 microns. The films typically show deep black color. Other electrolyte compositions can be properly chosen by one skilled in the art as described in the above cited reviews.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate comprising a porous layer in the front surface region thereof may be subjected to drying in an oxygen containing ambient atmosphere. The drying operation is optionally preceded by a wet clean and a rinse, and optionally may be rinsed and cleaned multiple times. In some embodiments, the handle substrates are subjected to rinsing, followed by transfer to wet cleaning and rinsing station, rinsed with deionized water, then dried in an oxygen containing ambient atmosphere, such as air or purified oxygen. Upon drying, the entire sidewall surfaces of the pores get oxidized ending up with so called native oxide, which is about 1 nm in thickness. If drying/oxidation is performed at room temperature, it typically takes some time, e.g., up to an hour, as after the hydrofluoric bath the surface is hydrophobic being terminated by hydrogen. Further hydrogen gradually desorbs from the surface, allowing it to oxidize. The cleaning can be also performed in wet cleaning solutions used in semiconductor industry as RCA-clean, Piranha clean, or cleaning in ozonated water. In this case, a chemical oxide is formed on pore wall surfaces, which is typically thicker than the native oxide, up to few nanometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the native oxide layer may be further oxidized to form a thicker oxide layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate, e.g., a single crystal silicon handle wafer, comprising pores may be thermally oxidized in a furnace such as an ASM A400.

The oxygen content may vary from 1 to 10 percent, or higher. In some embodiments, the oxidizing ambient atmosphere may be up to 100% (a “dry oxidation”). In an exemplary embodiment, semiconductor handle wafers may be loaded into a vertical furnace, such as an A400. The temperature is ramped to the oxidizing temperature with a mixture of N<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>. After the desired oxide thickness has been obtained, the O<sub>2 </sub>is turned off and the furnace temperature is reduced and wafers are unloaded from the furnace. Thermal oxidation can be used to fill porous films with low porosity with semiconductor oxide, e.g., silicon dioxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Thermal oxidizing of highly porous films is not desirable, as it might result in breakage of silicon walls between neighboring pores thus lowering yield. Plasma oxidation can be used resulting in thicknesses of silicon dioxide film on the sidewalls of the pores from 10 to 20 nm, depending on plasma conditions as frequency and power. Plasma oxidation consists of producing an oxygen plasma in a closed chamber (typically under vacuum). The plasma can be produced by microwave, r.f (radio frequency), or d.c. (direct current) plasma generator. This may also be called plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor (PECVD reactor).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, an oxide film on the porous silicon may be produced by anodic oxidation (typically referred to as anodization (for example anodization of aluminum)). This is done using the same porous silicon electrochemical cell. However, the electrolyte is changed to dilute sulfuric acid (concentrated sulfuric acid is used for aluminum anodization). For porous silicon, the literature suggests the use of 1M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. If the current is very high, arcing may occur. Oxidizing of the surfaces of the sidewall and bottom of the pores under high current in oxidizing electrolytes, such as sulfuric acid, is referred to as plasma electrolytic oxidation.

Further layer transfer is performed resulting in SOI wafer. This wafer also have additional 4<sup>th </sup>layer which serves as parasitic suppressor if RF chips are made on these wafers. This parasitic suppressor film does not have high density of traps, but it is still efficient in RF parasitics suppression as it has very high resistivity, i.e., semi-insulating properties.</div>

Polycrystalline material, e.g., polycrystalline silicon, denotes a material comprising small silicon crystals having random crystal orientations. Polycrystalline silicon grains may be as small in size as about 20 nanometers. According to the method of the present invention, the smaller the crystal grain size of polycrystalline silicon deposited the higher the defectivity in the charge trapping layer. Amorphous silicon comprises a non-crystalline allotropic form of silicon, which lacks short range and long range order. Silicon grains having crystallinity over no more than about 10 nanometers may also be considered essentially amorphous. Silicon germanium comprises an alloy of silicon germanium in any molar ratio of silicon and germanium.

In some embodiments, the dielectric layer, e.g., buried oxide layer, has a thickness of at least about 10 nanometer thick, such as between about 10 nanometers and about 10,000 nanometers, between about 10 nanometers and about 5,000 nanometers, or between about 100 nanometers and about 800 nanometers, such as about 600 nanometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Since the mechanical bond is relatively weak due to being held together by van der Waal's forces, the bonded structure is further annealed to solidify the bond between the donor wafer and the handle wafer. In some embodiments of the present invention, the bonded structure is annealed at a temperature sufficient to form a thermally activated cleave plane in the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate. An example of a suitable tool might be a simple Box furnace, such as a Blue M model. In some preferred embodiments, the bonded structure is annealed at a temperature of from about 200° C. to about 350° C., from about 225° C. to about 350° C., preferably about 350° C. Thermal annealing may occur for a duration of from about 0.5 hours to about 10 hour, preferably a duration of about 2 hours. Thermal annealing within these temperatures ranges is sufficient to form a thermally activated cleave plane. After the thermal anneal to activate the cleave plane, the bonded structure may be cleaved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">After the thermal anneal, the bond between the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate and the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate is strong enough to initiate layer transfer via cleaving the bonded structure at the cleave plane. Cleaving may occur according to techniques known in the art. In some embodiments, the bonded structure may be placed in a conventional cleave station affixed to stationary suction cups on one side and affixed by additional suction cups on a hinged arm on the other side. A crack is initiated near the suction cup attachment and the movable arm pivots about the hinge cleaving the wafer apart. Cleaving removes a portion of the semiconductor donor wafer, thereby leaving a semiconductor device layer, preferably a silicon device layer, on the semiconductor-on-insulator composite structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">After cleaving, the cleaved structure may be subjected to a high temperature anneal in order to further strengthen the bond between the transferred device layer and the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate. An example of a suitable tool might be a vertical furnace, such as an ASM A400. In some preferred embodiments, the bonded structure is annealed at a temperature of from about 1000° C. to about 1200° C., preferably at about 1000° C. Thermal annealing may occur for a duration of from about 0.5 hours to about 8 hours; preferably a duration of about 2 to 4 hours. Thermal annealing within these temperatures ranges is sufficient to strengthen the bond between the transferred device layer and the single crystal semiconductor handle substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">After the cleave and high temperature anneal, the bonded structure may be subjected to a cleaning process designed to remove thin thermal oxide and clean particulates from the surface. In some embodiments, the single crystal semiconductor donor wafer may be brought to the desired thickness and smoothness by subjecting to a vapor phase HCl etch process in a horizontal flow single wafer epitaxial reactor using H2 as a carrier gas. In some embodiments, an epitaxial layer may be deposited on the transferred device layer. The finished SOI wafer comprises the high resistivity single crystal semiconductor handle substrate (e.g., a single crystal silicon handle substrate), a charge trapping layer, a dielectric layer (e.g., buried oxide layer) prepared from oxidation of the single crystal semiconductor donor substrate, and the semiconductor device layer (prepared by thinning the donor substrate), may then be subjected to end of line metrology inspections and cleaned a final time using typical SC1-SC2 process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Radiofrequency chips of enhanced quality can be fabricated from this SOI wafer. The distributed oxide walls in the porous silicon prevent grain growth upon the polycrystalline silicon annealing. Consequently, the parasitic-suppressor film keeps high area of grain boundaries, and therefore high density of charge traps. Eventually, in the RF chips, the parasitic conductive channels are not induced, even if high temperature processing steps are used in the RF chip fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Having described the invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As various changes could be made in the above compositions and processes without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</div>
