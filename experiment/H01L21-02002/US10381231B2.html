<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional application 62/352,839 filed Jun. 21, 2016, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Ion beam etching is a method of removing small (e.g., nanometer scale) amounts of material from a substrate such as a wafer. Often, a patterned mask such as a photoresist or a hard mask is applied to a surface, and then ion beam etching is used to remove the unmasked material, leaving the masked material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In ion beam etching, the wafer, or other substrate being etched, can be rotated around a central axis during the etching process so that the angled ion beam has access to all sides of the feature being etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the major challenges facing semiconductor photolithography involves obtaining high density features, because typical printing processes for applying the mask cannot easily apply a pattern having a small spacing, less than about e.g., 28 nm, between adjacent features. Various alternate methods to obtain a spacing less than 28 nm between features have been attempted. For example, the mask can be applied in multiple, offset printing steps, to increase the density of features and thus decrease the spacing therebetween. As another example, an encapsulating coating or second mask can be applied over a first mask, after which the original mask is removed, thus creating two mask features for each first mask feature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">These methods can be difficult, complicated, and do not always provide acceptable features.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to multiple step ion beam etching processes that utilize masking elements to create additional masking elements, resulting in increased structure density and decreased spacing between adjacent structures. During the etching steps, the ion beam is not rotated but is stationary in relation to the surface being etched, but sequential etching steps utilize an opposite (e.g., 180 degree different) etching direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The processes of the present disclosure can additionally or alternately be described as patterning via multiple angled ion beam etching steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The density of the structures resulting from the multiple-step angled ion beam etching processes is greater than the density of the original structures by an odd multiple. In some implementations, the density of the structures is increased to three times the density of the original structures. In other implementations, the density of the structures is increased to five times the density of the original structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally or alternately, in some implementations, a center-to-center spacing between adjacent structures made by a multiple-step angled ion beam etching process is ⅓ of the center-to-center spacing of the original structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In one particular implementation, this disclosure provides a method that includes providing a substrate having at least two masking elements thereon, ion beam etching (without rotation) from a first direction at a first incidence angle and then ion beam etching (without rotation) from a second direction at the first incidence angle, the projection of the ion beam in the second direction being 180 degrees from the first direction. The method then includes ion beam etching from the first direction without rotation at a second incidence angle, and ion beam etching from the second direction without rotation but 180 degrees from the first direction at the second incidence angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In another particular implementation, a method includes providing a substrate having at least two masking elements thereon, ion beam etching (without rotation) the substrate from a first direction at a first incidence angle to provide a once-etched substrate, ion beam etching (without rotation) the once-etched substrate from a second direction with an angle of projection about 180 degrees from the first direction at the first incidence angle to provide a twice-etched substrate, ion beam etching the twice-etched substrate (without rotation) at a second incidence angle to provide a thrice-etched substrate, and ion beam etching (without rotation) the thrice-etched substrate with an angle of projection about 180 degrees from the direction of ion beam etching the twice-etched substrate, the etching the thrice-etched substrate occurring at the second incidence angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In another particular implementation, this disclosure provides a method that includes providing a substrate having a masking layer thereon and at least two masking elements on the masking layer. The method includes etching the masking layer in a first step at a first incidence angle without rotating the substrate relative to the etching. After the first step, then etching the etched masking layer in a second step at the first incidence angle without rotating the substrate relative to the etching, but with the second step done 180 degrees to the first step. After the second step, etching the etched masking layer again in a third step at a second incidence angle without rotating the substrate relative to the etching, the third step done 180 degrees to the first step or 180 degrees to the second step; and after the third step, etching the etched masking layer in a fourth step at the second incidence angle without rotating the substrate relative to the etching, but with the fourth step done 180 degrees to the third step.</div>

The method continues by forming a fourth etched region by ion beam etching from the first direction, without rotation, using the first masking element and the first etched region as shading structures and then forming a fifth etched region by ion beam etching the masking layer from the second direction, without rotation, 180 degrees from the first direction using the second masking element and the second etched region as shading structures.</div>

The method further includes forming a second etched region by ion beam etching from the first direction without rotation using the first masking element and the first etched region as shading structures, and then forming a third etched region by ion beam etching the masking layer from the second direction without rotation with an angle of projection about 180 degrees from the first direction using the second masking element and the second etched region as shading structures.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">This disclosure provides methods for obtaining a high density pattern (e.g., less than 28 nm between adjacent structures, e.g., 7 nm between adjacent structures) using an ion beam etch process on the substrate after applying a mask on the substrate. The mask (or other masking or shadowing structure) forms secondary masking features, which together, are used to form more final structures than the originally-present masking features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with the methods described herein, the substrate being etched is not rotated (either continuously or at all) in relation to the ion beam during the etching process; that is, etching does not occur during rotation of the substrate or ion beam. Rather, the substrate and the ion beam are fixed, or essentially fixed, in relation to each other during etching. Only between etching steps is the ion beam direction changed in relation to the substrate. Angled etching, using the masking element to partially shade the substrate, is done at 180 degree opposing projection angles. Ideally, subsequent etching steps are done at a projection angle 180 degrees from the previous process, however, due to structure undercut which is inherent in the actual process, the actual projection angle may be, e.g., up to 1-2 degrees, off from 180 degrees to accommodate and optimize the sidewall angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, subsequent etching steps are done at a different, e.g., larger, incident angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">During each etching step, the wafer may scan past the ion source (e.g., to improve uniformity), while maintaining a fixed incidence angle of the ion beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The following description provides additional specific implementations. It is to be understood that other implementations are contemplated and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense. While the present disclosure is not so limited, an appreciation of various aspects of the disclosure will be gained through a discussion of the examples provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawing that forms a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration at least one specific implementation. In the drawing, like reference numerals may be used throughout several figures to refer to similar components. In some instances, a reference numeral may have an associated sub-label consisting of a lower-case letter to denote one of multiple similar components. When reference is made to a reference numeral without specification of a sub-label, the reference is intended to refer to all such multiple similar components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Ion beam etch or etching is a process that utilizes an inert gas plasma (e.g., neon, argon) to bombard a substrate with ions and remove substrate material. Although the following discussion uses the phrase “ion beam etch” or variants thereof (e.g., ion beam etching, IBE) alternate phrases that can be used include ion beam milling, ion beam sputtering, focused ion beam, and variants thereof. Further, although IBE is used throughout, the processes described herein may also be done via reactive ion beam etch (RIBE) from a mixture of plasma based on inert gas, halocarbon, etc. or by chemically assisted ion beam etch (CAIBE) where the reactive gas is introduced into the etch chamber separate from the plasma source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates schematically a generic ion beam etching system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> has a chamber <b>102</b> with a platen <b>104</b> for supporting a substrate, such as a wafer <b>110</b>, e.g., a silicon (Si) wafer, a semiconductor wafer, a sapphire wafer, etc. The platen <b>104</b>, and the wafer <b>110</b>, can be configured to rotate about a central axis of the platen <b>104</b>. Also within the chamber <b>102</b> is an ion beam source <b>106</b>, configured to emit ions in the form of beams <b>108</b> toward the platen <b>104</b> and the wafer <b>110</b>. As indicated above, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a very generic schematic of an ion beam etch system, and a working ion beam etch system includes other features not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such as a plasma source, a target, intake and exhaust systems, and other equipment that is generally found in an ion beam etch system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> merely illustrates generic elements that facilitate the description of the ion beam etching methods below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The ion beam source <b>106</b> is configured to emit the ion beam <b>108</b> at an angle to the substrate <b>110</b> (other than straight down, or vertical, on to the substrate <b>110</b>). This angle of incidence is measured from the vertical and is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as angle α. The angle of incidence a is greater than 1 degree and less than 90 degrees. The ion beam source <b>106</b> and its position and orientation in relation to the platen <b>104</b> and the wafer <b>110</b> is sufficiently accurate to control the angle of incidence a to within less than 1 degree, often less than 0.1 degree. Examples of common angles of incidence a include 6 degrees, 10 degrees, 12 degrees, 15 degrees, and 30 degrees, although other angles can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Present on the wafer <b>110</b> is at least one masking or mask element <b>112</b>; in the illustrated implementation, five mask elements <b>112</b> are shown, although other implementations may have more or less. The mask element <b>112</b> may be, for example, a hard mask or a photoresist. Individual mask elements <b>112</b>, in this implementation, are separated by at least about 28 micrometers. The mask element <b>112</b> can be applied to the wafer <b>110</b> by any known process. Lithograph printing is one common method for applying the mask element <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">During an etching process, the ion beam <b>108</b> removes material from the surface of the wafer <b>110</b> that is not covered by or otherwise shielded by the mask elements <b>112</b>. During this etching, the platen <b>104</b> and wafer <b>110</b> are stationary in relation to the ion beam source <b>106</b> and the ion beam <b>108</b>; that is, there is no relative rotation in the processes of this disclosure, as is common with ion beam etching systems. Due to the angle of incidence a of the ion beam <b>108</b>, the mask element <b>112</b> shades a portion of the wafer <b>110</b> from the beam <b>108</b>. In general, the thicker (higher the structure of) the mask element <b>112</b>, the larger the shaded area of the wafer <b>110</b> on the side opposite the ion beam <b>108</b>. An example thickness for the mask element <b>112</b> is 100 nm for a photoresist material and about 25 nm for a hard mask material, although thicker and thinner masks <b>112</b> are known and can be used. Similarly, the greater the incident angle of the ion beam <b>108</b>, the larger the shaded area of the wafer <b>110</b>. Inset A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a mask element <b>112</b> shading a portion of the wafer <b>110</b>, thus resulting in the shaded portion of the wafer surface not being etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As indicated above, the platen <b>104</b> can be configured to rotate about a central axis. By rotating the platen <b>104</b> and wafer <b>110</b> (e.g., through 360 degrees, often multiple rotations) during the etching process, as is conventionally done, no portion of the wafer <b>110</b> is shaded from the ion beam <b>108</b> by the mask elements <b>112</b>. Thus, by rotating the wafer <b>110</b> during the etching process, ideally no area on the surface of the wafer <b>110</b> is shaded by the mask element <b>112</b> and all unmasked surfaces of the wafer <b>110</b> are etched essentially equally, resulting in the structure shown schematically in Inset B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">By using the mask element <b>112</b> to shade an area of the wafer <b>110</b> during etching without rotation (e.g., 360 degree rotation), uneven etching of the wafer <b>110</b> is obtained. Applicant found that the physical features left by this uneven etching can be used to form additional masking features between individual mask elements <b>112</b>, thus increasing the density of masking features and decreasing the distance between adjacent mask features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2D</figref> illustrate step-wise use of a mask or masking element as a designed shade or masking element for a subsequent etch step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a wafer <b>210</b> having a mask layer <b>211</b> thereon, with multiple masking elements <b>212</b>, particularly masking element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>and masking element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, on the mask layer <b>211</b>. The masking elements <b>212</b> have been applied via a conventional process (e.g., photolithography or a printing process) and have a distance of at least 28 nm therebetween, e.g., 35 nm. In the illustrated implementation, the mask layer <b>211</b> has a thickness (measured from the wafer <b>210</b>) of about 10 nm whereas the masking elements <b>212</b> have a thickness (height) of about 25 nm. As described above in respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and Inset A, the masking elements <b>212</b> shade a portion of the surface of the mask layer <b>211</b> from an ion beam <b>208</b> hitting at a first incident angle, when there is no rotation of the wafer <b>210</b> relative to the ion beam <b>208</b> (e.g., the ion beam <b>208</b> is unidirectional). The result is a first etched region <b>214</b>, illustrated at the base at the right side of masking element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, the first etched region <b>214</b> extending from the base of the element <b>212</b> <i>b </i>toward the element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>but short of the element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>due to the shading or shadowing caused by the masking element <b>212</b> <i>a</i>; although not illustrated, a similar etched first region would be at the right base of the masking element <b>212</b> <i>a</i>, due to a masking element that is not illustrated but that would be farther to the right in the figure. The wafer <b>210</b> is now “once-etched”, having the first etched region <b>214</b> formed by the single etching step and having a depth (of “x”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In a next step, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the once-etched wafer <b>210</b> is rotated relative to the ion beam <b>208</b> about 180 degrees (either the wafer <b>210</b> is rotated in relation to the ion beam <b>208</b> or the ion beam source is rotated in relation to the wafer <b>210</b>). In this step, the angle of incidence or projection of the ion beam <b>208</b> is essentially the same as, or within 1-2 degrees of the angle of incidence in the first step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, except that is it from the opposite direction. In an ideal situation, the angle of incidence will be exactly the same in the two steps (of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>), however, a portion of the masking elements <b>212</b> will erode during each etch step, so the angle of the second etch step will not necessarily be the same as the first angle due to this mask erosion. Any amount of mask erosion needs be understood and the subsequent etch angles should be selected so that they compensate for the mask erosion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Again, the masking elements <b>212</b> shade a portion of the surface of the mask layer <b>211</b> from the unidirectional ion beam <b>208</b> that is hitting at a first incidence angle without any rotation of the wafer relative to the ion beam <b>208</b>. This results in a twice-etched wafer having a second etched region <b>216</b> of a depth (“x”) similar to the depth of the first etched region <b>214</b> (assuming the etching conditions were the same in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the second region <b>216</b> being present in the location that was shaded in the first step (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), at the base at the left side of the masking element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>and extending toward element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>. Although not illustrated, a similar etched second region would be at the left base of the masking element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, due to a mask element that is not illustrated but that would be to the left of the figure. Thus, both the first region <b>214</b> and the second region <b>216</b> have had one exposure to the ion beam <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">A third etched region <b>218</b> results in the step illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> at the location where the first region <b>214</b> and the second region <b>216</b> overlap; this third etched region <b>218</b> has had two exposures to the ion beam <b>208</b>, a first exposure in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and a subsequent exposure in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> when the beams <b>208</b> are 180 degrees to each other. This third etched region <b>218</b> has a depth approximately twice that of the first etched region <b>214</b> and the second etched region <b>216</b>, or, about “2×.” This third region <b>218</b> is illustrated equidistant between the masking element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>and the masking element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, although in other implementations, it may not be. The width of the third region <b>218</b> is determined by the angle of incidence of the ion beam <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In a next step, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the twice-etched wafer <b>210</b> is again rotated relative to the ion beam <b>208</b> an amount of 180 degrees, back to the original position as in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In this step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the angle of incidence of the ion beam <b>208</b>′ is approximately twice the angle of incidence as in the steps of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> (e.g., if the angle of incidence in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> is about 15 degrees, in this step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> it is about 30 degrees). Again, the masking elements <b>212</b> shade a portion of the surface from ion beam <b>208</b>′; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows masking element <b>212</b> <i>a </i>shading a portion of the surface. In this step however, the surface being etched is the first etched region <b>214</b> (that was etched in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>); this results in a fourth etched region <b>220</b>, with a portion of the original first etched region <b>214</b> remaining due to it being shaded by the masking element <b>212</b> <i>a</i>. This fourth region <b>220</b>, on the thrice-etched wafer, has a depth approximately twice that of the first region <b>214</b> and the second region <b>216</b>, or, about “2×.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, in the step shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the thrice-etched wafer <b>210</b> is again rotated relative to the ion beam <b>208</b>′ 180 degrees, back to the position as in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In this step, the angle of incidence of the ion beam <b>208</b>′ is the same as, or at least within 1-2 degrees, of the angle of incidence in the third step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, approximately twice the angle of incidence of the steps of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Again, the masking elements <b>212</b> shade a portion of the surface from ion beam <b>208</b>′; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> shows masking element <b>212</b> <i>b </i>shading a portion of the surface. In this step, the surface being etched is the second etched region <b>216</b>; this results in a fifth etched region <b>222</b>, with a portion of the original second etched region <b>216</b> remaining due to it being shaded by the masking element <b>212</b> <i>b</i>. Similar to the fourth region <b>220</b>, the fifth region <b>222</b> has a depth approximately twice that of the first region <b>214</b> and the second region <b>216</b>, or, about “2×.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the four step etching process, with two steps done from opposite directions, results in two structures (the remainder of the first etched region <b>214</b> and the second etched region <b>216</b>) positioned between the masking elements <b>212</b> <i>a</i>, <b>212</b> <i>b</i>. The process can alternately be described as a process with two pairs of etching steps, with each step of a pair done from opposite directions. These two structures (remaining regions <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>) can be used as masking elements for a subsequent etching process, in effect, significantly increasing the density of masking elements (compared to the initial number of masking element) and decreasing the spacing between adjacent masking elements (again, compared to the initial spacing between adjacent masking elements) due to the two additional masking structures. As an example, if an original distance of 30 nm was between (center to center) the original masking elements <b>212</b> <i>a</i>, <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, the distance between elements <b>212</b> and the two additional elements <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> (specifically, between element <b>212</b> <i>b </i>and element <b>214</b>, between element <b>214</b> and element <b>216</b>, and element <b>216</b> and element <b>212</b> <i>a</i>) is now 10 nm; as another example, if 42 nm is between (center to center) the original masking elements <b>212</b>, the distance between adjacent elements <b>212</b> and the two additional elements <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> is now 12 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternate implementation, the ion beam <b>208</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is switched in direction, so that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> the projection of the ion beam <b>208</b>′ is from the same direction as the ion beam <b>208</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and then the ion beam <b>208</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is from the same direction as the ion beam <b>208</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, additional etching steps or pairs of etching steps could be subsequently done, thus forming further masking structures or masking elements. With each subsequent pair of etching steps, additional masking structures or elements are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> illustrate an example process for forming an example structure using ion beam etching as per the present processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a substrate <b>302</b> is provide having two continuous hard masks <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and a patterned mask having masking elements <b>308</b>. The masking elements <b>308</b> have been applied onto the hard mask <b>306</b> by any conventional method, such as photolithography. It is understood that the hard masks <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and masking elements <b>308</b> are chosen to selectively etch or withstand the following process steps. Other masks and masking elements can be used that would modify the example processes described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Using a four step (or, two pair step) process such as described above in respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2D</figref>, additional or secondary masking elements <b>306</b>′ are formed from the hard mask <b>306</b>, shown as masking elements <b>306</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Two of these masking elements <b>306</b>′ are present between the original masking elements <b>308</b>, thus tripling the density of available masking elements and decreasing the center-to-center distance between adjacent elements by ⅓.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The original masking elements <b>308</b> and the masking elements <b>306</b>′ are used as a mask for an etching process (e.g., reactive ion etch (ME)) that utilizes a vertical etch (having an incidence angle of zero). In the particular implementation illustrated, the vertical etching process etches into the hard mask <b>304</b> and removes masking elements <b>306</b>′ and <b>308</b>. The resulting structures, masking elements <b>304</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, are formed from the hard mask <b>304</b>. The resulting masking elements <b>304</b>′ are more densely packed and have less distance therebetween, than the initial masking elements <b>308</b>, and have essentially equal height across them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A subsequent etching process such as a vertical ME, performs a deep etch into the substrate <b>302</b> using the masking elements <b>304</b>′. The result, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, is a patterned substrate <b>302</b>′ with the masking elements <b>304</b>′ remaining on the etched substrate <b>302</b>′. In a subsequent step, the masking elements <b>304</b>′ are removed and the resulting structure <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. This resulting structure <b>300</b> has a more dense arrangement of features than the original masking elements <b>308</b> with a closer spacing therebetween.</div>
