<heading id="h-0007">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A single substrate processing type substrate processing apparatus includes, for example, a plurality of processing units. A controller included in the substrate processing apparatus makes each processing unit perform operations (processing) in accordance with a prepared schedule. At a starting time of a substrate processing step or a preliminary preparation process among the various operations performed at the respective processing units, a control load (CPU load or communication processing load) of the controller may become high due to sending/receiving of processing content data, reading of the processing content data, and data interpretation. Therefore, when a plurality of processing units are to be made to start the substrate processing step, etc., together at the same time, the processing content data are sent at the same time and the control load concentrates at the controller so that data processing cannot be performed smoothly and as a result, the start of the substrate processing step or preliminary preparation process, etc., at some processing unit may become delayed. Uniformity of substrate processing at the respective processing units thus cannot be guaranteed and a problem may occur in substrate processing results. For example, if time from carry-in into a processing unit to start of substrate processing varies, time during which a substrate is exposed to a mist inside a substrate unit becomes non-uniform. The mist may influence a surface state of a substrate and it is thus preferable for the time to the start of substrate processing to be uniform among substrates. Also, if time taken for a substrate, for which the substrate processing has ended, to be carried out from a processing unit varies, time until substrate processing can be started at a subsequent processing unit becomes non-uniform and it may not be possible to apply an effect of a preceding substrate processing to a subsequent substrate processing with stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When such phenomena occur, the same substrate processing effect may not be obtained even if the same recipe is applied to the respective substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Although as a measure for preventing delay of start of processing, improvement of processing performance of the controller or increase of the number of controllers may be considered, such measures may lead to cost increase due to installation of a new controller. Moreover, such measures may cause consumption power to increase and the arrangement of the substrate processing apparatus to become complex. The present inventor is thus examining avoidance of concentration of control load at the controller by improvement of efficiency of data processing at the controller through design of schedule preparation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is thus to provide a schedule preparation method that enables preparation of schedules with which efficiency of data processing at a controller is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate processing apparatus capable of processing substrates while achieving improvement of efficiency of data processing at a controller.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Solution to the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a schedule preparation method being a method, by which a schedule preparing portion included in a substrate processing apparatus, having at least one single substrate processing unit that processes one substrate at a time and a controller arranged to control the processing unit, prepares a schedule for specifying operations of the substrate processing apparatus in chronological order, and including a schedule preparation step of preparing a schedule for each substrate by positioning, in chronological order, a plurality of blocks, each specifying contents of an operation to be performed on the substrate by the substrate processing apparatus, and where the schedule preparation step includes a high load avoidance positioning step in which, in preparing the schedules for a plurality of substrates, blocks, each corresponding to a high load operation that is an operation in which a high control load occurs at least temporarily in the controller, are positioned on a time axis so that high load time slots, each being a time slot during which a high control load occurs in the controller, are not concentrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">With the present method, the schedule preparing portion prepares the schedule for each substrate by positioning, in chronological order, the plurality of blocks, each specifying the contents of an operation to be performed on the substrate and prepares the substrate schedules for the number of substrates to be processed. In this step, the blocks corresponding to the high load operations are positioned on the time axis so that the high load time slots are not concentrated. With the thus prepared schedules, the concentrating of control load in the controller is avoided. A schedule preparation method that enables preparation of schedules with which efficiency of data processing at the controller is improved can thus be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of the blocks corresponding to the high load operations has high load information added to a portion corresponding to the high load time slot, and in the high load avoidance positioning step, the blocks corresponding to the high load operations are positioned so that not less than a predetermined number of the high load information are not allocated to the same time slot in preparing the schedules for the plurality of substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">With the present arrangement, the schedule preparing portion positions each block corresponding to a high load operation so that not less than the predetermined number of the high load information are not allocated to the same time slot. The blocks corresponding to the high load operations can thereby be positioned reliably and easily so that the high load time slots thereof do not become concentrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the high load time slots may be a starting time of the high load operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">With the present method, the control load of the controller may increase at a starting time of operation of each resource due to sending/receiving of processing data or data interpretation of the processing data at the controller. That is, the starting times of the high load operations are high load time slots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">If in the schedules of the plurality of substrates, the blocks corresponding to high load operations are positioned with respect to each other on the time axis so that the high load operations are started at the same time, the control load of the controller may concentrate at the starting time of the high load operations and it may not be possible to perform data processing smoothly. Consequently, the start of operation of some resource may become delayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">On the other hand, with the present method, the schedule preparing portion positions the blocks, corresponding to high load operations, on the time axis so that the starting times of the corresponding high load operations are not concentrated at the same time period. The concentration of control load in the controller is thus avoided and consequently, schedules with which the efficiency of data processing at the controller is improved can be prepared and delay of start of operation of a resource can thus be prevented reliably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The high load operations may include at least one of a substrate processing step, in which the processing unit processes a substrate, a preliminary processing step, in which the processing unit performs preparation for the substrate processing step, a pre-carry-in processing step, in which the processing unit performs an operation for carrying a substrate inside the processing unit, and a substrate recovery step, in which a predetermined processing is applied to a substrate prior to recovery of the substrate from the processing unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate processing apparatus may be arranged so that after preparation of a schedule for a predetermined first substrate among a plurality of substrates of a process job in common has ended, execution of the prepared schedule starts in a state where preparation of a schedule for a predetermined second substrate, among the plurality of substrates, for which a processing order is later than that of the first substrate, has not ended. In this case, the method may further include a schedule changing step, in which, after execution of the prepared schedule is started, a yet-to-be-executed portion of the prepared schedule is changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">With the present method, when the preparation of the schedule for some substrate among the plurality of substrates of the process job in common has ended, the execution of the prepared schedule is started even if the preparation of the schedules for the other substrates has not ended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, if, as described in Patent Literature 1, operation of a substrate processing apparatus is arranged to be started after preparation of schedules for all substrates of a process job in common has ended, an enormous amount of data must be stored in the substrate processing apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">On the other hand, with the present method, it suffices to store at least the schedule of the substrate to be executed and the amount of schedule data to be stored in the substrate processing apparatus can thereby be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Also, the yet-to-be-executed portion of the prepared schedule is changed after the start of the schedule and therefore schedule contents can be changed in accordance with actual operation circumstances (substrate processing circumstances) of the substrate processing apparatus. Flexible schedule preparation in accordance with the actual operation circumstances is thus enabled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The schedule changing step may include a step, in which, after the start of execution of the schedule, a yet-to-be-executed block in the prepared schedule is deleted, and a repositioning step, in which the deleted block is repositioned in chronological order in parallel to the positioning of blocks for the second substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">With the present method, the yet-to-be-executed block deleted from the prepared schedule is repositioned in chronological order in parallel to the positioning of blocks for the second substrate. The repositioning of the deleted block and the positioning of the blocks for the second substrate are performed in chronological order so that the processing of the plurality of substrates is performed without giving rise to mutual interference among the plurality of substrates and by making the resources (the processing units, etc.) operate efficiently. Positioning positions of the deleted block and the blocks for the second substrate can be determined more finely to enable improvement of operation rates of the resources and productivity of the substrate processing apparatus can thereby be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, the present invention provides a substrate processing apparatus, including at least one single substrate processing unit that processes one substrate at a time, a controller arranged to control the processing unit, and a schedule preparing portion arranged to prepare schedules for specifying operations of a resource, including the processing unit, in chronological order, and where the controller controls the resource in accordance with the schedules that the schedule preparing portion prepared by the schedule preparation method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">With the present arrangement, the schedule preparing portion prepares a schedule for each substrate by positioning, in chronological order, a plurality of blocks, each specifying contents of an operation to be performed on the substrate, and the substrate schedules are prepared for the number of substrates to be processed. In this step, blocks corresponding to high load operations are positioned on a time axis so that high load time slots are not concentrated. With the thus prepared schedules, the concentrating of control load in the controller is avoided. The controller controls the resources in accordance with each schedule and therefore a substrate processing apparatus capable of processing substrates while achieving improvement of efficiency of data processing at the controller can thus be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The controller may, after preparation of a schedule for a predetermined first substrate among a plurality of substrates of a process job in common has ended, start execution of the prepared schedule in a state where preparation of a schedule for a predetermined second substrate, among the plurality of substrates, for which a processing order is later than that of the first substrate, has not ended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">With the present arrangement, when the preparation of the schedule for some substrate has ended, the execution of the prepared schedule is started even if the preparation of the schedules for the other substrates has not ended. An amount of schedule data to be stored in the substrate processing apparatus can therefore be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the description of preferred embodiments provided below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The substrate processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes an indexer section <b>2</b> and a processing section <b>3</b>. The processing section <b>3</b> includes a receiving/passing unit PASS for receiving and passing of a substrate W with respect to the indexer section <b>2</b>. The indexer section <b>2</b> passes an unprocessed substrate W to the receiving/passing unit PASS and receives a processed substrate W from the receiving/passing unit PASS. The processing section <b>3</b> receives the unprocessed substrate W from the receiving/passing unit PASS and performs various types of processing, such as processing using a processing agent (a processing liquid or a processing gas), processing using electromagnetic waves, such as ultraviolet rays, etc., physical cleaning processing (brush cleaning, spray nozzle cleaning, etc.), etc., on the substrate W. The processing section <b>3</b> then passes the processed substrate W to the receiving/passing unit PASS.</div>

A base end portion of the articulated arm <b>7</b> is coupled to the base portion <b>6</b> so as to be capable of pivoting around a vertical axis. Further, the articulated arm <b>7</b> is coupled to the base portion <b>6</b> so as to be capable of being elevated and lowered with respect thereto. In other words, the base portion <b>6</b> incorporates an elevating/lowering drive mechanism that elevates and lowers the articulated arm <b>7</b> and a pivoting drive mechanism that pivots the articulated arm <b>7</b> around the vertical axis. Also, the articulated arm <b>7</b> includes an individual pivoting drive mechanism that pivots each arm portion individually. Each of the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is coupled to a tip portion of the articulated arm <b>7</b> so as to be capable of pivoting individually around a vertical axis and advancing and retreating individually in the horizontal direction. The articulated arm <b>7</b> includes a hand pivoting drive mechanism arranged to pivot each of the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B individually around the vertical axis, and a hand advancing/retreating mechanism arranged to advance and retreat each of the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B individually in the horizontal direction. Each of the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is arranged, for example, to be capable of holding a single substrate W. Although the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B may be disposed in a vertically overlapped state, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hands <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B are shown to be shifted in a direction parallel to the plane of paper (horizontal direction) for the sake of clarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">With the present arrangement, the indexer robot IR operates so that the hand <b>8</b>A carries out a single unprocessed substrate W from the substrate container C held by one of the stages ST<b>1</b> to ST<b>4</b> and passes it to the receiving/passing unit PASS. Further, the indexer robot IR operates so that the hand <b>8</b>B receives a single processed substrate W from the receiving/passing unit PASS and then houses it in a substrate container C held by one of the stages ST<b>1</b> to ST<b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The processing section <b>3</b> includes a plurality (twelve, in the present preferred embodiment) of processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b>, a main transfer robot CR, and the above-described receiving/passing unit PASS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are disposed three-dimensionally in the present preferred embodiment. More specifically, the plurality of processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are disposed so as to constitute a three-tiered structure, with four processing units being disposed at each tier. That is, the four processing units SPIN<b>1</b>, SPIN<b>4</b>, SPIN<b>7</b>, and SPIN<b>10</b> are disposed at a first tier portion, another four processing units SPIN<b>2</b>, SPIN<b>5</b>, SPIN<b>8</b>, and SPIN<b>11</b> are disposed at a second tier portion, and yet other processing units SPIN<b>3</b>, SPIN<b>6</b>, SPIN<b>9</b> and SPIN<b>12</b> are disposed at a third tier portion. Even more specifically, the main transfer robot CR is disposed at a center of the processing section <b>3</b> in plan view, and the receiving/passing unit PASS is disposed between the main transfer robot CR and the indexer robot IR. A first processing unit group G<b>1</b>, in which the three processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>3</b> are stacked, and a second processing unit group G<b>2</b>, in which another three processing units SPIN<b>4</b> to SPIN<b>6</b> are stacked, are disposed so as to face each other across the receiving/passing unit PASS. A third processing unit group G<b>3</b>, in which the three processing units SPIN<b>7</b> to SPIN<b>9</b> are stacked, is disposed so as to be adjacent to the first processing unit group G<b>1</b> at a side further from the indexer robot IR.

In other words, this information expresses that when one of the designated processing units cannot be used, substitution by another designated processing unit is possible. “Cannot be used” refers to a state where the processing unit is being used for the processing of another substrate W, a state where the processing unit is malfunctioning, a state where an operator desires not to process the substrate W by the processing unit, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The “usable processing liquid information” is information related to the processing liquids (the various chemical liquids and the rinse liquid) used in the substrate processing included in the recipe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The “processing time information” is information related to time required for execution of each of the processes included in the recipe. Specifically, the information includes staying time of the substrate in the designated processing unit of the recipe and time required for execution of preliminary processing steps (preliminary preparation process and post-processing process) described below. That is, the preliminary processing steps are processing preparing for a substrate processing step before execution of the substrate processing at a predetermined processing unit so that the substrate processing can be executed with precision and, in the present preferred embodiment, correspond to the preliminary preparation process executed before the substrate processing and the post-processing process executed after the immediately prior substrate processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The “preliminary preparation execution condition” is information related to the preliminary preparation process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The preliminary preparation process is a preliminary preparation operation that is to be executed at a processing unit before execution of a predetermined substrate processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, as described above using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, each of the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> is provided with the temperature adjusting apparatus <b>58</b> for discharging a predetermined chemical liquid at a defined temperature toward a substrate W. Although the chemical liquid is required to be discharged at the target temperature defined in the recipe toward the substrate W, a fixed time is required for the temperature adjusting apparatus <b>58</b> to heat the chemical liquid to the target temperature. The liquid delivery apparatus <b>54</b> may thus be actuated in a state where the circulation valve <b>57</b> is opened and the temperature adjusting apparatus <b>58</b> is actuated to circulate the chemical liquid inside the circulation piping <b>56</b> from before the chemical liquid is discharged from the chemical liquid nozzle <b>51</b> toward the substrate W (Preliminary Preparation Process Example 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Also, if chemical liquid that has fallen outside the target temperature range remains in at least one of either the chemical liquid nozzle <b>51</b> or the chemical liquid piping <b>53</b>, chemical liquid of a temperature outside the target temperature may be discharged toward the substrate W. Therefore, so-called pre-dispensing, by which a small amount of the chemical liquid is released from the chemical liquid nozzle <b>51</b> from a predetermined time before actually starting the chemical liquid discharge, may be executed (Preliminary Preparation Process Example 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In the preliminary preparation execution condition are described such specific contents of the preliminary preparation process as what preliminary preparations (for example, the opening of the circulation valve <b>57</b>, the actuation of the temperature adjusting apparatus <b>58</b> and the liquid delivery apparatus <b>54</b>, the temperature adjustment at the predetermined set temperature by the temperature adjusting apparatus <b>58</b>, etc., in the case of performing Preliminary Preparation Process Example 1) are to be started at which timing (for example, a predetermined time before starting the substrate processing) (for example, a predetermined time before starting the substrate processing in the allocated processing unit or a predetermined time before the chemical liquid is actually discharged from the chemical liquid nozzle <b>51</b>), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, information related to whether or not the preliminary preparation process is required is also described in the preliminary preparation execution condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Whether or not the preliminary preparation process is required is determined from the contents of the substrate processing, the contents of the substrate processing executed prior to the substrate processing, etc. The following example is given as an example of whether or not the preliminary preparation process is required. For example, if substrate processing using a processing liquid that is high in temperature dependence is to be executed, it is considered necessary to perform the pre-dispensing process as the preliminary preparation process and therefore the execution of the preliminary preparation process is set to “required.” On the other hand, if substrate processing using a processing liquid that is low in temperature dependence is to be executed, the pre-dispensing process is unnecessary and therefore the execution of the preliminary preparation process is set to “not required.” The contents of the preliminary preparation process and whether or not it is required are defined according to each process job.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, if substrate processing requiring preliminary preparation process is to be executed successively, as a rule, there is no need to execute the preliminary preparation process before each of the second and subsequent substrate processing at the same processing unit. However, even when the preliminary preparation process is executed for a prior substrate processing, if, due to an apparatus abnormality, etc., a long amount of time elapses before the subsequent substrate processing step is started, it may be judged that the preliminary preparation process is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The “post-processing execution condition” is information related to the post-processing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The post-processing process is an operation that is to be executed at any of the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> after execution of the predetermined substrate processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The post-processing execution condition includes information related to the specific contents of the post-processing process and information related to whether or not the post-processing process is required. Whether or not the post-processing process is required and the contents of the post-processing process are defined according to each block included in the recipe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">A specific example of the post-processing process is a cleaning processing of the interior of the processing chamber <b>17</b> of any of the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> (chamber cleaning process). By executing the cleaning of the interior of the processing chamber <b>17</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), imparting of influences of substrate processing of a prior substrate W on a substrate W that is subsequently carried into the processing chamber <b>17</b> can be avoided. Precise substrate processing can thereby be realized and the substrate processing quality can be maintained. The post-processing process is not restricted to the cleaning process (chamber cleaning process) and may be cleaning of the chuck pins holding the substrate (chuck pin cleaning process) or a cleaning processing of other parts (for example, the processing cup <b>16</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>)) inside the processing chamber <b>17</b> (parts cleaning process) and may include two or more of these cleaning processes. The chamber cleaning and the parts cleaning may be executed by discharging the cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid nozzle <b>62</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In the post-processing execution condition is described information related to whether or not the post-processing process is required. Whether or not the post-processing process is required is defined according to each block included in the recipe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Whether or not the post-processing process is required is determined from the contents of the substrate processing, the contents of the substrate processing executed prior to the substrate processing, the contents of the substrate processing executed immediately after the substrate processing, etc. The following example is given as an example of whether or not the post-processing process is required. If substrate processing with a high possibility of contaminating the processing chamber <b>17</b> is to be performed, the post-processing process is set to “required” regardless of whether or not substrate processing is performed subsequently. Also, for example, if a predetermined time elapses or a predetermined number of substrates W are processed without the post-processing process being executed in the same processing chamber <b>17</b>, the post-processing process is set to “required.” Further, if there is a possibility of imparting influence on substrate processing performed immediately after in the same processing chamber <b>17</b>, the post-processing process must be executed after the substrate processing and therefore “required” is set. Oppositely, if the substrate processing does not impart an influence on the immediately subsequent substrate processing, as in a case where just the same processing liquid is used in the immediately prior substrate processing, etc., there is no need to perform the post-processing process after the substrate processing and therefore “not required” is set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">A process job refers to one or a plurality of substrates W to which a processing in common is applied. A process job code is identification information for identifying the process job. That is, a plurality of substrates W that are assigned a process job code in common are subject to a processing in common in accordance with a recipe corresponding to the process job code. However, processing contents (recipes) corresponding to different process job codes may also happen to be the same. For example, when a processing in common is applied to a plurality of substrates W that are consecutive in processing order (order of dispensing from a substrate container C (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, etc.)), a process job code in common is assigned to the plurality of substrates W.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">If the preliminary preparation processes at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>2</b> are planned based just on a logic of “positioning at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time,” a plurality of the preliminary preparation processes may start at the same time. Especially, when, as in a first modification example of schedule preparation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, during schedule preparation for substrates W that are assigned some process job code, execution of substrate processing is already started for substrates W that are assigned a different process job code, the preliminary preparation processes for the substrates W of the predetermined process job (processing units SPIN<b>3</b> to SPIN<b>12</b>) are planned based just on the logic of “positioning each block at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time,” these plurality of (for example, ten) preliminary preparation blocks may be positioned so as to be aligned at a planned startable time point (time point at which the schedules can be started). In this case, the preliminary preparation processes at the processing units SPIN<b>3</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are planned to be started at the same time, so that, as a result of the control load of the second controller <b>34</b> concentrating at the starting time of the preliminary preparation processes, the second controller <b>34</b> cannot perform data processing smoothly and this may give rise to a problem, such as processing delay occurring in substrate processing being executed (processing at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> and SPIN<b>2</b>), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">On the other hand, with the present preferred embodiment, each of the preliminary preparation blocks is positioned at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time and while avoiding the high load information HL from being allocated to the same time slot as the high load information HL of a block that has been positioned already. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, the preliminary preparation processes at the processing units SPIN<b>3</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are planned so as to be shifted in starting time with respect to each other. A problem, such as processing delay, etc., can thus be avoided during execution of substrate processing (processing at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> and SPIN<b>2</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">Especially with the present preferred embodiment, a period from commanding of start of substrate processing to actual start of substrate processing can be made substantially the same among the respective substrates W and therefore an effect of substrate processing based on the same recipe can be made uniform among the respective substrates. This shall now be described more specifically. A data flow until a start of substrate processing is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>. Based on the schedule data <b>33</b> or based on a processing execution command issued by the processing execution commanding portion <b>31</b> based on the schedule data <b>33</b>, the CPU <b>37</b> of the sub-controller <b>23</b> judges that a timing for starting substrate processing has arrived (time point t<b>1</b>). The CPU <b>37</b> requests the second storage portion <b>35</b> for a recipe corresponding to the substrate processing to be executed (time point t<b>2</b>). The second storage portion <b>35</b> selects and sends the recipe to the SPU <b>37</b> (time point t<b>3</b> to time point t<b>4</b>). The CPU <b>37</b> performs data interpretation of the received recipe and generates the control signal for making a control object processing unit (for example, the processing unit SPIN<b>1</b>) execute the recipe (time points t<b>5</b> to t<b>6</b>). The CPU <b>37</b> then sends the generated control signal to the processing unit SPIN<b>1</b> (time points t<b>7</b> to t<b>8</b>). Upon receiving the control signal, the processing unit SPIN<b>1</b> actually starts the substrate processing (time point t<b>9</b>). Time of a predetermined length is thus required for the processing unit SPIN<b>1</b> to actually start the substrate processing from the arrival of the timing for starting the substrate processing (time points t<b>1</b> to t<b>9</b>). In the present preferred embodiment, scheduling is performed so that the substrate processing is not started at the same time for a plurality of substrates W and therefore a processing speed of the CPU <b>37</b> will not become delayed. The times required for the sending/receiving of the recipe (time points t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b>), data interpretation (time points t<b>5</b> to t<b>6</b>), and sending/receiving of the control signal (time points t<b>7</b> to t<b>8</b>) will thus not differ greatly among each substrate W. The time from the arrival of the timing for starting the substrate processing to the actual start of substrate processing at each processing unit SPIN can thus be made substantially the same. Uniformity of substrate processing can thus be secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">Also, when the schedule preparation for a certain substrate (for example, the first substrate A<b>1</b>) ends, execution of the prepared schedules is started even if the schedule preparation has not ended for another substrate (for example, the substrates W from the second substrate A<b>2</b> onward). Reduction of schedule data amount stored in the first storage portion <b>26</b> can thus be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">Also, yet-to-be executed blocks deleted from prepared schedules are repositioned in chronological order in parallel to the positioning of blocks related to a substrate W for which a schedule is to be prepared anew. The repositioning of the deleted blocks and the positioning of the blocks related to the new substrate W are performed in chronological order so that mutual interference does not arise among the plurality of substrates W and so that the plurality of substrates W are processed by putting the resources (the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b>, etc.) in operation efficiently. The positioning positions of the deleted blocks and the blocks related to the new substrate W can be determined more finely to enable improvement of operation rates of the resources and productivity of the substrate processing apparatus <b>1</b> can thereby be improved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">On the other hand, with the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, each of the post-processing blocks is positioned at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time and while avoiding the high load information HL from being allocated to the same time slot as the high load information HL of a block that has been positioned already. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the post-processing blocks for the processing units SPIN<b>8</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are shiftingly positioned on the time axis with respect to each other. That is, the respective post-processing processes at the processing units SPIN<b>8</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are planned so as to be shifted in starting time with respect to each other. A problem, such as processing delay, etc., can thus be avoided during execution of substrate processing (processing at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>7</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a third modification example of schedule preparation. In the third modification example, an example of positioning of post-processing blocks, each of which is a block for specifying a substrate recovery step to be described below, is illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">With the substrate processing apparatus <b>1</b>, parallel recovery, with which, in a state where substrates W are housed in a plurality of processing units, the substrates W are recovered in a batch from the respective processing units, may be made available. A substrate recovery step is executed at each processing unit prior to the parallel recovery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">The substrate recovery step is a process that is executed to put a substrate W in a state enabling carry-out to the exterior of the processing chamber <b>17</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). A specific example of the substrate recovery step is a water washing processing of the substrate W. By water-washing the substrate W, the substrate W can be transferred to the exterior of the processing chamber <b>17</b> regardless of the state of the substrate W before execution of the substrate recovery step. The water washing processing of the substrate W may be executed by discharging a rinse liquid onto the substrate W from the rinse liquid nozzle <b>59</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) while rotating the substrate W. After the substrate recovery steps, the substrates W are carried out from the processing chambers <b>17</b> of the respective processing units by the main transfer robot CR (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Each substrate recovery step corresponds to a “high load operation” described above. That is, at a starting time of the substrate recovery step, the serial communication portion <b>36</b> of the sub-controller <b>23</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) reads a substrate recovery recipe from the second storage portion <b>35</b>. The CPU <b>37</b> performs data interpretation of the read recipe and generates a control signal for realizing the recipe at a control object processing unit among the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN <b>12</b>. The serial communication portion <b>36</b> sends the generated control signal to the control object processing unit among the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b>. Also, immediately upon receiving the control signal, the control object processing unit among the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> sends a reception confirmation signal toward the serial communication portion <b>36</b>. A data amount of the recipe for the substrate recovery step is enormous and therefore a high control load arises temporarily in the CPU <b>37</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). A high load time slot is thus present at the starting time of the substrate processing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">If, in planning such substrate recovery steps, blocks of the substrate recovery steps (hereinafter, “substrate recovery blocks”) are positioned based just on the logic of “positioning at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time,” the substrate recovery blocks for the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> may be positioned so as to be aligned at the same time period. In this case, the substrate recovery steps at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are started at the same time so that, as a result of the control load of the second controller <b>34</b> concentrating at the starting time of the substrate recovery steps, the second controller <b>34</b> cannot perform data processing smoothly and a delay may arise in the substrate recovery steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">On the other hand, with the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, each of the substrate recovery blocks is positioned at the earliest position on the time axis so that the same resource is not used overlappingly at the same time and while avoiding the high load information HL from being allocated to the same time slot as the high load information HL of a block that has been positioned already. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the substrate recovery blocks for the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are shiftingly positioned on the time axis with respect to each other. That is, the respective substrate recovery steps at the processing units SPIN<b>1</b> to SPIN<b>12</b> are planned so as to be shifted in starting time with respect to each other. A problem, such as processing delay, etc., can thus be avoided in the substrate recovery steps.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Also, although with each of the preferred embodiments described above, a case where blocks are positioned so that a plurality of the high load information HL will not be allocated to the same time slot was indicated, an arrangement may be made where allocation of not less than a predetermined number (for example, three) of the high load information HL to the same time slot is prohibited and a plurality of the high load information HL may be allocated to the same time as long as it is less than the predetermined number.</div>
