In some embodiments, the method <b>100</b> for minimizing an average surface roughness of a soft metal layer for bonding is provided. The method <b>100</b> begins with an operation <b>101</b> in which an epitaxial layer <b>120</b> is formed on a growth substrate <b>110</b> (also referred to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The method <b>100</b> continues with an operation <b>102</b> in which the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> (also referred to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). The method <b>100</b> continues with an operation <b>103</b> in which a glue layer <b>150</b> is formed on a carrier substrate <b>160</b> (also referred to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). The method <b>100</b> continues with an operation <b>104</b> in which a combination of the glue layer <b>150</b> and the carrier substrate <b>160</b> is placed on a bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> (also referred to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). The method <b>100</b> continues with an operation <b>105</b> in which a laser lift-off process LLO is performed to separate the growth substrate <b>110</b> from the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> (also referred to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in which the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> is formed on the growth substrate <b>110</b>, and is also made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> includes a first type semiconductor layer <b>126</b>, an active layer <b>124</b>, and a second type semiconductor layer <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the first type semiconductor layer <b>126</b> is present on the growth substrate <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the active layer <b>124</b> is present on the first type semiconductor layer <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the second type semiconductor layer <b>122</b> is joined with the first type semiconductor layer <b>126</b> through the active layer <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the second type semiconductor layer <b>122</b> is a p-type semiconductor layer, but should not be limited thereto. In some embodiments, the first type semiconductor layer <b>126</b> is an n-type semiconductor layer, but should not be limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> in which the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, a thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is in a range from about 0.2 μm to about 2 μm, and the average surface roughness of a bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is greater than a first value. In some embodiments, a preferable thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is in a range from about 0.3 μm to about 1 μm. If the thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is too thin, the soft metal layer <b>130</b> may be too thin for bonding (e.g., too thin for performing an interstitial diffusion, which will be described later). If the thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is too thick, the time for depositing the soft metal layer <b>130</b> will be too long and greatly increase the cost. In addition, a film polish is too expensive to be performed to reduce the average surface roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> when the thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is in a range from about 0.2 μm to about 2 μm. In some embodiments, the first value is greater than 80 nm. In some embodiments, the soft metal layer <b>130</b> includes at least one of indium (In), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), Gallium (Ga), silver (Ag), and cadmium (Cd), or combinations thereof. The soft metal layer <b>130</b> can be formed by electron gun deposition (e-gun), sputtering, chemical plating (electroless plating), or electroplating. In some embodiments, an adhesive layer <b>140</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> before the formation of the soft metal layer <b>130</b>. The adhesive layer <b>140</b> is used for better adhesion of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> on the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>. The adhesive layer <b>140</b> may include chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), or a combination thereof, but should not be limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref> in which the glue layer <b>150</b> is formed on the carrier substrate <b>160</b>, and the combination of the glue layer <b>150</b> and the carrier substrate <b>160</b> is placed on a bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the glue layer <b>150</b> is in contact with the bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the glue layer <b>150</b> is an ultraviolet glue layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 4</figref> in which the laser lift-off process LLO is performed to separate the growth substrate <b>110</b> from the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a next stage of the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> after the laser lift-off process LLO is performed and the growth substrate <b>110</b> is separated from the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, after the laser lift-off process LLO is performed to separate the growth substrate <b>110</b> from the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>, the average surface roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b> of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is reduced to be less than a second value. The second value is smaller than the first value due to a pressure induced by shock waves and heat produced during said laser lift-off process LLO on the bonding surface, which slightly melts and smoothens the soft metal layer <b>130</b> with an assistance of the glue layer <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the second value is less than 80 nm. In some embodiments, the second value is less than 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The above “roughness reduction” effect is of great help for various kinds of manufacturing processes after the laser lift-off process LLO, such as a micro-bonding process performed to bond a portion of a combination of the soft metal layer <b>130</b>, the adhesive layer <b>140</b>, and the epitaxial layer <b>120</b> to another substrate with a conductive pad (e.g., a copper pad) thereon, in which the bonding surface <b>132</b> is in contact with said conductive pad. Said micro-bonding process may be performed after said combination is chipped into a plurality of combinations each containing a portion of the soft metal layer <b>130</b>, a portion of the adhesive layer <b>140</b>, and a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, said micro-bonding process is aimed at bonding a micro device with a lateral length less than or equal to about 100 μm. The roughness reduction is crucial since in the micro-bonding process a good quality of bonding is preferred to be conducted by an interstitial diffusion between the soft metal layer <b>130</b> and the conductive pad instead of melting the soft metal layer <b>130</b>. Therefore, an amount of area of real contact parts between the soft metal layer <b>130</b> and the conductive pad when the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is placed onto the conductive pad is important for a good quality of bonding made by the interstitial diffusion. The roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b> lower than 80 nm (or preferably lower than 50 nm) is qualified for said micro-bonding process. Besides, if the thickness of the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is too thin, a bonding force formed by the interstitial diffusion will be too weak to bond the soft metal layer <b>130</b> to the conductive pad. In some other embodiments, said micro-bonding process further includes a liquid assisted binding before the occurrence of said interstitial diffusion. Specifically, a liquid (e.g. water) is present between the soft metal layer <b>130</b> and said conductive pad after or before the soft metal layer <b>130</b> is placed onto the conductive pad. After that, the liquid is evaporated and then said interstitial diffusion occurs to bond the soft metal layer <b>130</b> to the conductive pad via an adequate heating. Said roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b> which is lower than 80 nm is also important for the liquid assisted binding since the lower the roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b>, the more liquid (i.e., water) present between the soft metal layer <b>130</b> and the conductive pad can be in contact with both the soft metal layer <b>130</b> and the conductive pad so as to enhance a quality of the liquid assisted binding due to higher contact area between the conductive pad and the bonding surface <b>132</b> through the liquid during evaporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be mentioned that in a mass production manufacturing, the efficiency is important in every process, including the deposition process. As a result, extremely low deposition rate method (which usually leads to lower roughness) such as a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and an atomic layer deposition (ALD) are not suitable for the mass production manufacturing. Preferred methods may include electron gun deposition (e-gun), sputtering, chemical plating (electroless plating), or electroplating. However, these methods may not guaranteed to produce the bonding surface <b>132</b> with the roughness lower than 80 nm. In order to reach the desirable roughness of the bonding surface <b>132</b>, the above-mentioned glue layer <b>150</b> and said laser lift-off process LLO provides a suitable pressure to smoothen the bonding surface <b>132</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In summary, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for minimizing an average surface roughness of a soft metal layer for bonding. A glue layer and a laser lift-off process LLO are present to provide a suitable pressure to smoothen a roughness of a bonding surface of the soft metal layer such that the bonding surface can act as a better interface for a following micro-bonding process.</div>
