<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/584,228 filed on May 2, 2017, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a laser processing apparatus for performing laser processing to a wafer formed of silicon, sapphire, silicon carbide, or gallium nitride, for example.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A plurality of devices such as integrated circuits (ICs), large scale integrations (LSIs), light emitting diodes (LEDs), surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, and power devices are formed on the front side of a wafer so as to be separated from each other by a plurality of crossing division lines. The wafer thus having the devices on the front side is laser-processed along each division line by a laser processing apparatus to form a division start point along each division line. The wafer is then divided along each division line where the division start point is formed, thereby obtaining individual device chips. The device chips thus obtained are used in electrical equipment such as mobile phones, personal computers, and illumination equipment (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1998-305420, for example). The laser processing apparatus is composed generally of a chuck table for holding a workpiece, laser beam applying means having condenser for applying a laser beam to the workpiece held on the chuck table, and feeding means for relatively feeding the chuck table and the laser beam applying means, whereby the laser beam is applied along each division line formed on a wafer as the workpiece with high accuracy, thereby forming a division start point along each division line where the wafer is to be divided into individual device chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, in general, a laser processing apparatus for forming such a division start point is classified into a type such that a laser beam having an absorption wavelength to the workpiece is applied to perform ablation as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1998-305420 and a type such that a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to the workpiece is applied in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the workpiece, thereby forming a modified layer (see Japanese Patent No. 3408805, for example). In either type, however, the laser beam must be applied plural times (in plural passes) along each division line, so as to completely cut the wafer, causing a reduction in productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">To cope with this problem, the present applicant has developed and proposed a technique of suitably setting the numerical aperture of a focusing lens for focusing a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to a wafer as a workpiece and applying the laser beam to the wafer, according to the refractive index of the material forming the wafer, thereby forming a plurality of shield tunnels along each division line as a division start point, wherein each shield tunnel extends from the front side of the wafer to the back side thereof, and each shield tunnel is composed of a fine hole and an amorphous region surrounding the fine hole (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2014-221483, for example). In the technique disclosed in the above publication, the focusing lens included in condenser constituting laser beam applying means is provided by an aspherical lens with the shape of its convex or concave surface adjusted or by the combination of plural lenses, whereby the laser beam is focused at one point on an optical axis passing through a work point in the wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the conventional shield tunnel formed by the laser processing apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2014-221483, a weak division start point can be formed without the need for applying a laser beam plural times (by plural shots) at the same work point. However, it is not easy to form a plurality of desired uniform shield tunnels along each division line according to a change in material or thickness of the wafer. In particular, the strength (weakness) of each shield tunnel to be formed along each division line is largely dependent upon the power of the laser beam to be applied to the wafer. Accordingly, the power of the laser beam must be suitably adjusted so that each shield tunnel to be formed along each division line has a predetermined strength. However, in the case of setting the focal point of the laser beam at one point inside a thinned wafer to form a plurality of shield tunnels along each division line, it is difficult to uniformly form the plural shield tunnels over the entire length of each division line. As a result, in dividing the wafer into individual device chips by applying an external force to the wafer after forming the shield tunnels along each division line, there is a problem such that a relatively large external force (e.g., 40 N) is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a laser processing apparatus which can form a plurality of shield tunnels inside a wafer along each division line where the wafer can be divided without the need for a large external force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a laser processing apparatus comprising: a chuck table for holding a wafer; laser beam applying means for applying a laser beam to said wafer held on said chuck table; and a feeding mechanism for relatively feeding said chuck table and said laser beam applying means; said laser beam applying means including a laser oscillator for oscillating said laser beam, and a condenser having a focusing lens for focusing said laser beam oscillated by said laser oscillator and applying said laser beam focused to said wafer held on said chuck table; said condenser having a function of spherical aberration such that a focal point to be formed by said laser beam passing through a radially inner portion of said condenser is continuously changed in position toward said chuck table from a focal point to be formed by said laser beam passing through a radially outer portion of said condenser; said laser beam being applied to said wafer in the condition where the focal point of said laser beam is set inside said wafer so as to be continuously changed in position along the thickness of said wafer, thereby forming a shield tunnel inside said wafer, said shield tunnel being composed of a fine hole and an amorphous region surrounding said fine hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the function of spherical aberration is realized by the focusing lens having spherical aberration. Alternatively, the function of spherical aberration is realized by the focusing lens and a focal point correcting plate located between the focusing lens and the chuck table for correcting the position of the focal point of the laser beam to be focused by the focusing lens. Preferably, the range of change in position from the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially outer portion of the condenser to the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially inner portion of the condenser is set to 50 to 2000 Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the laser processing apparatus of the present invention, the condenser has a function of spherical aberration which means a function of continuously changing the position of the focal point of a laser beam to be focused by the condenser and applied to a wafer, along the thickness of the wafer. Accordingly, a uniform shield tunnel composed of a fine hole and an amorphous region surrounding the fine hole can be formed so as to extend from the front side of the wafer to the back side thereof, by one shot of the laser beam. As a result, the energy of the laser beam applied to the wafer can be effectively used to form a good shield tunnel. That is, a uniform shield tunnel can be formed without the need for particularly increasing the power of the laser beam to be applied, so that the strength of the shield tunnel functioning as a division start point can be reduced. Accordingly, the wafer can be divided into individual device chips by applying an external force weaker than that in the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3</figref>. The condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>essentially includes the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d</i>. According to the technical idea of the present invention, the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>has a function of spherical aberration such that a focal point P<b>1</b> to be formed on the optical axis of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>by a laser beam LB<b>1</b> passing through a radially inner portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>is displaced (continuously changed in position) toward the chuck table <b>54</b> from a focal point Pn to be formed on the optical axis of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>by a laser beam LBn passing through a radially outer portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d</i>. This function of spherical aberration may be realized by a spherical lens generally known in the art. However, the present invention is not limited to this configuration, but an aspherical lens or the combination of plural spherical lenses and aspherical lenses may be adopted to realize the function of spherical aberration. That is, any configuration may be adopted, provided that the focal points P<b>1</b> to Pn can be positioned inside the wafer <b>10</b> so as to be displaced in the direction where the laser beam LB enters the wafer <b>10</b>, i.e., along the thickness of the wafer <b>10</b>. Further, the range of displacement of the focal points P<b>1</b> to Pn is preferably set to 50 to 2000 Î¼m. This range of displacement is not necessarily required to be larger than the thickness of the wafer <b>10</b> as the workpiece. For example, in the case that the thickness of the wafer <b>10</b> is 300 Î¼m, the focal points P<b>1</b> to Pn are preferably displaced over the range from the front side of the wafer <b>10</b> to the back side thereof, i.e., over the wafer thickness of 300 Î¼m, whereby each shield tunnel can be formed more satisfactorily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The operation of the laser processing apparatus <b>40</b> will now be described with reference to the drawings. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, there is shown a perspective view of the wafer <b>10</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the wafer <b>10</b> is formed from a lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) substrate. The front side of the wafer <b>10</b> is formed with a plurality of crossing division lines <b>12</b> to define a plurality of separate regions where a plurality of SAW devices <b>14</b> are formed. The back side of the wafer <b>10</b> is attached to an adhesive tape T supported at its peripheral portion to an annular frame F. Thus, the wafer <b>10</b> is supported through the adhesive tape T to the annular frame F in the condition where the front side of the wafer <b>10</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">First, the wafer <b>10</b> supported through the adhesive tape T to the annular frame F is placed on the vacuum chuck <b>56</b> of the chuck table <b>54</b> in the condition where the adhesive tape T is oriented downward. Further, the annular frame F is held by the clamps <b>58</b>. Thereafter, the suction means (not shown) connected to the vacuum chuck <b>56</b> is operated to apply a vacuum to the vacuum chuck <b>56</b>, thereby holding the wafer <b>10</b> through the adhesive tape T on the vacuum chuck <b>56</b> under suction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">After holding the wafer <b>10</b> on the vacuum chuck <b>56</b> under suction, the X moving means <b>60</b> and the Y moving means <b>65</b> are operated to move the chuck table <b>54</b> and thereby position the wafer <b>10</b> directly below the imaging means <b>45</b>. In the condition where the wafer <b>10</b> held on the chuck table <b>54</b> is positioned directly below the imaging means <b>45</b>, an alignment step is performed by the imaging means <b>45</b> and the control means (not shown) to detect a target area of the wafer <b>10</b> to be laser-processed. More specifically, the imaging means <b>45</b> and the control means (not shown) perform image processing such as pattern matching for making the alignment between the division lines <b>12</b> extending in a first direction on the wafer <b>10</b> and the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>of the laser beam applying means <b>44</b> for applying a laser beam along these division lines <b>12</b>. Similarly, the alignment step is performed also for the other division lines <b>12</b> extending in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">After performing the alignment step for all of the division lines <b>12</b>, the chuck table <b>54</b> is moved to a laser beam applying area where the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>is located. Further, one end of a predetermined one of the division lines <b>12</b> extending in the first direction is positioned directly below the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>. Thereafter, focal position adjusting means (not shown) included in the laser processing apparatus <b>40</b> is operated to move the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>along its optical axis and thereby set the focal point P of the laser beam LB at a predetermined position inside the lithium tantalate substrate of the wafer <b>10</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4C</figref>, the laser beam LB<b>1</b> is a laser beam passing through a radially innermost portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d</i>. The focal point P<b>1</b> to be formed by the laser beam LB<b>1</b> is set inside the wafer <b>10</b> at a position near the chuck table <b>54</b>, i.e., near the back side of the wafer <b>10</b>. On the other hand, the laser beam LBn is a laser beam passing through a radially outermost portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d</i>. The focal point Pn to be formed by the laser beam LBn is set inside the wafer <b>10</b> at a position near the front side of the wafer <b>10</b> where the devices <b>14</b> are formed. Accordingly, the focal point P to be formed by the laser beam LB passing through the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>is displaced over the range from the back side of the wafer <b>10</b> to the front side thereof. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4C</figref>, the laser beam LB is so shown as to be decomposed into the laser beams LB<b>1</b> to LBn, and the focal point P of the laser beam LB is so shown as to be decomposed into the focal points P<b>1</b> to Pn for convenience of illustration. However, in actual, the laser beam LB is not seen so as to be decomposed as shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">After setting the focal point P as described above, the laser beam applying means <b>44</b> is operated to oscillate the laser beam LB (pulsed laser beam) from the laser oscillator <b>44</b> <i>b</i>. The laser beam LB oscillated from the laser oscillator <b>44</b> <i>b </i>is input into the attenuator <b>44</b> <i>c</i>, in which the power of the laser beam LB is adjusted to a predetermined value. Thereafter, the laser beam LB is focused by the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>and applied to one end of the predetermined division line <b>12</b> on the wafer <b>10</b>. When the application of the laser beam LB is started, the X moving means <b>60</b> is operated to move the chuck table <b>54</b> in the direction shown by an arrow X in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, thereby scanning the laser beam LB along the predetermined division line <b>12</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>, a plurality of shield tunnels <b>100</b> are continuously formed along the predetermined division line <b>12</b>, wherein each shield tunnel <b>100</b> is composed of a fine hole <b>102</b> extending vertically (axially over the entire length of each shield tunnel <b>100</b>) and a cylindrical amorphous region <b>104</b> for shielding the fine hole <b>102</b> so as to surround the same. This laser processing is similarly performed along all of the other division lines <b>12</b> formed on the front side of the wafer <b>10</b> by operating the laser beam applying means <b>44</b>, the chuck table <b>54</b>, the X moving means <b>60</b>, and the Y moving means <b>65</b>, thereby forming a plurality of similar shield tunnels <b>100</b> along each division line <b>12</b> (shield tunnel forming step). After performing the shield tunnel forming step, the wafer <b>10</b> is transferred to any apparatus for performing a dividing step of dividing the wafer <b>10</b> into individual device chips corresponding to the respective devices <b>14</b> by applying an external force to the wafer <b>10</b>. This dividing step is not essential in the present invention. As the apparatus for performing the dividing step, any dividing means known in the art may be used (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2014-221483, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and its related description, for example). Accordingly, the detailed description of the dividing step and the dividing means will be omitted herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>in the laser processing apparatus <b>40</b> has a function of spherical aberration such that the focal point P<b>1</b> to be formed by the laser beam LB<b>1</b> passing through the radially inner portion of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>is displaced toward the chuck table <b>54</b> from the focal point Pn to be formed by the laser beam LBn passing through the radially outer portion of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>, wherein the laser beam LB composed of the laser beams LB<b>1</b> to LBn is applied to the wafer <b>10</b> in the condition where the focal point P of the laser beam LB is set inside the wafer <b>10</b>, thereby forming the shield tunnel <b>100</b> composed of the fine hole <b>102</b> and the amorphous region <b>104</b> surrounding the fine hole <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the energy of the laser beam LB can be effectively used for the formation of the shield tunnel <b>100</b>, so that a plurality of good shield tunnels <b>100</b> can be continuously formed along each division line <b>12</b> over the entire length thereof. Further, each shield tunnel <b>100</b> can be formed over the entire thickness of the wafer <b>10</b>, so that each division line <b>12</b> can be sufficiently reduced in strength over the entire length. Accordingly, in the dividing step, the wafer <b>10</b> can be easily divided into the individual device chips by applying a relatively small external force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In this preferred embodiment, the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a </i>has a function of spherical aberration such that the focal point P<b>1</b> to be formed by the laser beam LB<b>1</b> passing through the radially inner portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d </i>is displaced toward the chuck table <b>54</b> from the focal point Pn to be formed by the laser beam LBn passing through the radially outer portion of the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>d</i>. This configuration is merely illustrative, and the present invention is not limited to this configuration. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a modification of the above configuration. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>â² having a focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>and a focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>may be used in place of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>. The focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>is located between the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>and the chuck table <b>54</b>. The focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>has a lens surface for forming a focal point at one position inside the wafer <b>10</b>. The focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>is located between the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>and the wafer <b>10</b> held on the chuck table <b>54</b>, and it has a function of correcting the focal point of the laser beam having passed through the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>in such a manner that the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through a radially inner portion of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>is displaced toward the chuck table <b>54</b> from the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through a radially outer portion of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The above-mentioned function of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>may be realized by using glass as the material of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>and forming a spherical convex surface as the beam entrance surface of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>where the laser beam enters. By locating the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>at the above-mentioned position, the traveling direction of the laser beam LB having passed through the focusing lens <b>44</b> <i>e </i>is corrected by passing the laser beam through the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g</i>, that is, the traveling direction of the laser beam is changed between at the radially inner portion of the focal point correcting plate <b>44</b> <i>g </i>and the radially outer portion thereof. Accordingly, the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially inner portion of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>â² is displaced toward the chuck table <b>54</b> from the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially outer portion of the condenser <b>44</b> <i>a</i>â², wherein the laser beam is applied to the wafer <b>10</b> in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the wafer <b>10</b> to thereby form a shield tunnel. As a result, an effect similar to that in the above preferred embodiment can be achieved. That is, the energy of the laser beam can be effectively used for the formation of the shield tunnel, so that a plurality of good shield tunnels can be continuously formed along each division line over the entire length thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The term of âthe function of spherical aberrationâ does not mean the function obtained in only the case that a completely spherical convex lens is used to provide aberration. Essentially, this term includes the function of providing the configuration that the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially inner portion of the condenser is displaced toward the chuck table from the focal point to be formed by the laser beam passing through the radially outer portion of the condenser. Further, while the laser beam is applied to the front side of the wafer where the SAW devices are formed in the above preferred embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this configuration. The laser beam may be applied to the back side of the wafer in the condition where the front side of the wafer is oriented downward.</div>
