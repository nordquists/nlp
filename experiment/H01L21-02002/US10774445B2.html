<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wafer production method for efficiently producing a wafer from a lithium tantalate ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A surface acoustic wave (SAW) device is formed such that a function layer is stacked on the surface of a wafer made of lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) as a material and is partitioned by division lines. Then, processing is performed along the division lines of the wafer by a cutting apparatus or a laser processing apparatus such that the wafer is divided into individual SAW devices. The SAW devices are used in a high frequency filter and so forth adopted in mobile communication equipment such as a portable telephone set, a personal computer or video media equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, it is known that a wafer on which devices are to be formed is produced generally by slicing an ingot using a wire saw and the front and rear faces of the sliced wafer are polished to finish the faces each into a mirror face (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-094221).</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Where an ingot is cut by a wire saw and polished at the front and rear faces thereof to produce a wafer, there are problems that it is not easy to make the wafer to be produced thin in order to achieve reduction in thickness and weight of devices, and that, if it is intended to reduce the thickness of a wafer to be produced as far as possible, then the ratio of the ingot scraped off upon cutting and polishing increases, which is uneconomical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Especially, a lithium tantalate ingot is high in Mohs hardness, and there is a problem that cutting of a lithium tantalate ingot by a wire saw requires considerable time and is low in productivity. Further, since an ingot having a high unit price is scraped off and wastefully discarded upon processing, it is demanded to develop a method of producing a thin wafer by efficiently cutting a lithium tantalate ingot without wasting the lithium tantalate ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a production method of a wafer by which a wafer can be efficiently produced from a lithium tantalate ingot and the amount of the ingot to be discarded can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a wafer production method for producing a wafer from a lithium tantalate ingot which is a 42-degree rotation Y cut ingot having an end face extending perpendicularly with respect to a center axis set with a rotational angle of 42 degrees with respect to a Y axis orthogonal to a crystal axis of a lithium tantalite and having an orientation flat formed in parallel to the Y axis, comprising: a modified layer formation step of irradiating a laser beam of a wavelength having transparency to lithium tantalate with a focal point of the laser beam positioned at a depth corresponding to a thickness of a wafer to be produced from the end face of the lithium tantalate ingot to form a modified layer in the inside of the lithium tantalate ingot while the lithium tantalate ingot is fed for processing relative to the laser beam; and a wafer production step of applying, after the modified layer formation step is carried out, external force to the lithium tantalate ingot to peel off a plate-shaped material from the lithium tantalate ingot to produce a wafer, wherein, when a modified layer is formed in the inside of the lithium tantalate ingot at the modified layer formation step, the lithium tantalate ingot is relatively fed for processing with respect to the laser beam in a direction parallel or perpendicular to the orientation flat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the wafer production method further includes a grinding step of grinding a peeling face of the produced wafer and a peeling face of the lithium tantalate ingot to flatten the peeling faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">With the present invention, when a modified layer is to be formed at the modified layer formation step, a laser beam is relatively fed for processing in a parallel direction or an orthogonal (vertical) direction with respect to the orientation flat. Therefore, the cleavage direction exists in a transverse direction with respect to the direction in which the modified layer is formed. Consequently, a crack grows in parallel to the end face of the lithium tantalate ingot, and a wafer can be peeled off readily from the lithium tantalate ingot. Accordingly, a wafer can be produced efficiently from a lithium tantalate ingot and the amount of the lithium tantalate ingot to be discarded can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the inventor of the present invention has found out that, when processing for adjusting the focus point of the pulse laser beam to the inner side by the predetermined distance from the surface of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> fixed to the holding table <b>34</b> by the focus point position adjustment means not depicted and relatively moving the holding table <b>34</b> and the laser beam irradiation means <b>5</b> to form a modified layer to perform peeling off of a wafer is performed, a wafer is sometimes peeled off well and sometimes not peeled off well depending upon the angle defined by the direction in which feeding for processing is performed in order to continuously irradiate the laser beam upon the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> and the orientation flat <b>71</b> of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> placed on the holding table <b>34</b>, namely, that laser processing for the orientation flat <b>71</b> of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> has an angle dependence. The angle dependence is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the modified layer formation step described above, the direction for the processing feeding of the holding table <b>34</b> on which a pulse laser beam was to be irradiated was changed among four directions (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) of 0 degree (parallel), 45 degrees, 90 degrees (right angle) and 135 degrees with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b> of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> placed on the holding table <b>34</b>. Then, the modified layer formation step was performed in the quite same processing conditions except the angle of the orientation flat <b>71</b>, with respect to the processing feeding direction, of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> when the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> was placed on the holding table <b>34</b>, and then the peeling step was carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, when wafers were produced in the processing conditions described above, it became clear that a characteristic difference was caused by the processing angle defined by the orientation flat <b>71</b> of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> placed on the holding table <b>34</b> and the processing feeding direction as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In particular, it was confirmed that, if the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> is placed on the holding table <b>34</b> and the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is to be irradiated is set so as to be 0 degree (parallel) with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, then while a crack stretches with a length of 70 to 80 μm in a transverse direction from the laser irradiation position in laser processing, in a vertical (depthwise) direction, the crack stretches only within a range from 10 to 20 μm. This signifies that an interface along which peeling occurs is formed so as to extend in parallel to an end face of the ingot and peeling off can be performed well at the peeling step and that a wafer is formed in a state in which the surface roughness of the peeling face after the peeling off is good. Similarly, it was confirmed that, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, also when laser processing was performed setting the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is to be irradiated so as to be 90 degrees (right angle) with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, while a crack was generated with a length of approximately 50 μm in a transverse direction from the laser irradiate position while a crack was generated only by approximately 20 μm in the vertical (depthwise) direction, and also when laser processing was carried out setting the processing feeding direction so as to be 90 degrees (right angle) with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, an interface was formed so as to extend in parallel to an end face of the ingot and it was possible to perform peeling off well at the peeling step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast, when the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is to be irradiated was set to 45 degrees or 135 degrees with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, while a crack stretched with a length of 35 to 45 μm in the transverse direction from a modified layer formed by laser processing, a crack was generated within a range of 35 to 45 μm also in the vertical (depthwise) direction. Consequently, it was not possible to form an interface parallel to an end face of the lithium tantalate ingot <b>7</b> well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">When considered on the light of the above, if the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is to be irradiated is set to 0 degree or 90 degrees with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, then a crack is generated such that it stretches longer in the transverse direction (horizontal direction) than in the vertical (depthwise) direction by laser processing for forming a modified layer thereby to form an interface, and consequently, a wafer can be peeled off readily in parallel to an end face of the ingot. Since the crack stretched longer in the transverse direction than that where the direction is set to 45 degrees or 135 degrees, laser processing can be carried out increasing the index feeding (index) distance, and it is recognized that also it is possible to improve the processing efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, if the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is irradiated is set to 0 degree or 90 degrees with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, since the crack generated in the vertical direction is short, the surface roughness of the peeling face of the wafer is good and also the grinding step after the processing can be ended in a short period of time. Further, also the amount of the ingot discarded at the wafer production step is reduced and also contribution to improvement of the processing efficiency is anticipated. It is to be noted that, as apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, where the direction for the processing feeding when a pulse laser beam is irradiated is set to 0 degree with reference to the orientation flat <b>71</b>, it is possible to allow a crack to be generated longer in the transverse direction than that where the direction is set to 90 degrees, and a crack in the vertical direction can be suppressed short. Therefore, that the direction is set to 0 degree is preferable in that a wafer of lithium tantalate can be peeled off readily and efficiently and the amount of the ingot which is discarded can be reduced further.</div>
