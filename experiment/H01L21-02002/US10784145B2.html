<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form part of the disclosure and show specific exemplary embodiments for illustration purposes. In this context, a direction terminology such as âtop sideâ, âbottomâ, âfront sideâ, ârear sideâ, âat the frontâ, âat the backâ, etc. is related to the orientation of the figures currently being described. Since the component parts of the exemplary embodiments can be positioned in different orientations, the direction terminology is used only for explanation purposes and is in no way limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">It goes without saying that other exemplary embodiments also exist and structural or logical changes can be made, without departing in the process from the scope defined by the patent claims. The description of the exemplary embodiments is non-limiting in this respect. In particular, elements of each of the exemplary embodiments described below can be combined with elements from other exemplary embodiments from among those described, unless something different is evident from the context.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Insofar as the terms âhaveâ, âcontainâ, âencompassâ, âcompriseâ and the like are used here, they are open terms which indicate the presence of the stated elements or features, but do not exclude the existence of further elements or features. The indefinite articles and the definite articles encompass both the plural and the singular, unless something different is unambiguously evident from the context. Range indications which indicate a lower and/or an upper limit include the limit(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">If a value range with the indication of one limit value or two limit values is defined for a physical variable, then the prepositions âfromâ and âtoâ include the respective limit value. An indication of the type âfrom . . . toâ is accordingly understood as âfrom at least . . . to at mostâ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a method for producing a semiconductor component comprises providing a wafer composite comprising an auxiliary substrate, a donor substrate and a sacrificial layer formed between the auxiliary substrate and the donor substrate (<b>902</b>). Functional elements are formed in a component layer comprising at least one partial layer of the donor substrate (<b>904</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The functional elements can be for example pn junctions, doped regions of diodes and/or transistor cells, resistors and/or electrical lines which determine the electrical functionality of the semiconductor component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Forming the functional elements can be preceded by, inter alia, horizontally splitting the donor substrate and/or growing epitaxial layers on the side of the donor substrate. After forming the functional elements, the auxiliary substrate is separated from the component layer by means of heat input into the sacrificial layer (<b>906</b>). The heat input is effected for example by impingement with a pulsed laser beam that penetrates through the auxiliary substrate and focuses in the region of the sacrificial layer. In this case, the material of the sacrificial layer is at least partly decomposed and/or at least partly melts. The auxiliary substrate is maintained substantially unchanged and can be reused for producing a further semiconductor component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In accordance with one embodiment, before forming the functional elements, a layer thickness of the component layer is increased, e.g. by means of an epitaxial method. The method thus makes it possible, inter alia, to produce electronic components in epitaxial layers which grow on thin crystalline seed layers obtained from a donor substrate. With regard to the content of impurities and/or with regard to a basic doping, the epitaxial layers can be adapted to predefined requirements more easily than a crystal pulled in a melt method. Moreover, the total thickness of the component layer can be established comparatively precisely and is subject only to minor fluctuations. In the case of vertical power semiconductor components having a load current flow through two opposite main surfaces, the heat input required for separating component layer and auxiliary substrate can contribute to a conditioning of the component rear side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In accordance with one embodiment, the donor substrate comprises a first crystalline semiconductor material and the auxiliary substrate comprises a second crystalline semiconductor material. The first and second crystalline semiconductor materials can comprise different or the same main constituents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">By way of example, the main constituent of the donor substrate and of the auxiliary substrate is in each case silicon or the main constituent of the donor substrate and of the auxiliary substrate is in each case silicon carbide. Here and hereinafter a main constituent of a component part, e.g. of the donor substrate or of the auxiliary substrate, can be taken to mean the material system on which said component part is based. By way of example, the component part in this case consists of the main constituent, with the exception of production-dictated impurities and/or dopants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">By way of example, the first and second crystalline semiconductor materials comprise the same main constituents and differ only in the doping and/or the crystal shape, that is to say with regard to the crystal type, the polytype and/or the absence or presence of grain boundaries, wherein such grain boundaries exist between crystallites in a polycrystalline semiconductor material and such grain boundaries are absent in monocrystalline or amorphous semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Besides the sacrificial layer, the layer structure can comprise one or a plurality of auxiliary layers, for example adhesion layers which enable and/or facilitate bonding between that part of the wafer composite which comprises the donor substrate and that part of the wafer composite which comprises the auxiliary substrate, reflection layers which make it more difficult for the laser radiation to penetrate into the component layer, and/or thermal protection layers which reduce a heat input into the component layer and/or absorb the energy introduced and transfer it to the sacrificial layer. Alternatively or additionally, the layer structure can comprise one or a plurality of functional layers which are permanently connected to the component layer in the course of the method and fulfil a technical function in the finalized semiconductor component, e.g. as rear-side metallization or rear-side electrode.</div>

A normal <b>104</b> to the first substrate surface <b>101</b> defines a vertical direction. Directions parallel to the first substrate surface <b>101</b> are horizontal directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The thickness of the donor substrate <b>100</b> between the first substrate surface <b>101</b> and the second substrate surface <b>102</b> lies in a range of from at least 50 Î¼m to at most 1500 Î¼m. The horizontal cross section through the donor substrate <b>100</b> can be an ellipse, in particular a circle, having a notch or having a flattened portion on the circle circumference or a rectangle having rounded corners.</div>

By way of example, the sacrificial layer <b>250</b> predominantly, i.e. to the extent of at least 95%, in particular at least 99%, contains silicon nitride or completely consists of silicon nitride.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In the case of bonding (direct bonding), the adhesion between two touching and sufficiently planar surfaces is based on van der Waals forces, hydrogen bridge bonds, and/or chemical bonds of metallic, ionic or covalent nature, wherein the surfaces of two layers composed of the same material or composed of two different materials can be involved. Bonding can comprise pressing the two surfaces against one another, a thermal treatment of the touching surfaces or a combination of both (fusion bonding, thermocompressive bonding, bonding by atomic rearrangement). Alternatively, bonding can comprise anodic bonding, in which, during a thermal treatment, an electric field is applied over the connection area and/or a current flows through the connection area.</div>
