<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a silicon wafer serving as a substrate material for a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a method for manufacturing a silicon wafer suitably used as a substrate material of a highly laminated semiconductor device such as a three-dimensional NAND flash memory (hereinafter, referred to as “3DNAND”).</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A 3DNAND is recently attracting attention. The 3DNAND is a NAND memory formed by vertically stacking memory cell arrays and, by setting the number of layers (number of layers of a word line) to 64, a storage capacity as very large as 512 Gbit (64 GB) per single die can be achieved. Further, not by increasing density in a planar direction as in a conventional planar type NAND memory, but by increasing density in a height direction, it is possible to provide a high performance flash memory which is excellent not only in capacity, but also in writing speed and power saving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the manufacture of a semiconductor device, films of various materials such as an oxide film, a nitride film, and a metal film are laminated on a silicon wafer so as to form a device structure. These laminated films have different film stresses depending on a film property and formation process conditions, which may produce a warp in the silicon wafer. Particularly, the 3DNAND is formed by vertically stacking several tens or more of memory elements, so that, correspondingly the number of laminated films increases geometrically, with the result that the film stress enormously increases in proportion to the increase in the number of the laminated films, and this significantly increases the warpage of the silicon wafer. A large warp of the silicon wafer during a device process causes troubles that prevent processing in the subsequent processes, such as film formation, processing and inspection from being performed properly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Regarding the manufacture of a semiconductor device having three or more wiring layers, Patent Document 1, for example, describes a semiconductor device manufacturing method capable of reducing the warpage of a silicon substrate to equal to or less than a predetermined value without depending on the type of a fabrication apparatus to be used and without using a special interlayer film forming process. In this manufacturing method, assuming that the thickness of a silicon substrate is T (μm), the diameter thereof is D (inch), and the number of wiring layers is n, a silicon substrate satisfying T≥62.4×D×[1.6(n−1)+1.0]<sup>1/2 </sup>is used to manufacture a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, Patent Documents 2 and 3 describe a method of manufacturing an epitaxial silicon wafer having high flatness by forming an epitaxial layer on the surface of a silicon wafer for epitaxial growth having a bowl-shaped warp (having a concave at the center thereof).</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the semiconductor device manufacturing method described in Patent Document 1 assumes that the film stress of the wiring layer is not varied, and the formation process dependency of the film stress is ignored. Actually, the film stress varies dependent on the formation process conditions, so that the amount of warpage cannot be evaluated only from the number of wiring layers. Thus, it is difficult to apply this manufacturing method. Further, when the number of wiring layers is set to 500 in a 12-inch silicon wafer, it is enough, according to the above formula, to satisfy the thickness T of the silicon wafer≥777.1 μm, which, however, is substantially equal to the standard thickness (775 μm) of the 12-inch wafer and, thus, it is clear that the effect of suppressing the warping cannot be expected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The specifications (thickness, etc.) of a silicon wafer are previously specified irrespective of the amount or shape of the warp. Thus, even when warpage occurs in the silicon wafer during a device process, it is impossible to cope with the warping of the wafer due to absence of the criterion for specification change of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The larger the thickness of a silicon wafer, the more unlikely the silicon wafer is warped, so that it can be thought that a silicon wafer having a very large thickness in which warpage hardly occurs under any conditions is used. However, the larger the thickness of a silicon wafer, the smaller the number of wafers that can be obtained from one silicon single crystal ingot, which will not only deteriorate product yield but also cause various problems in the subsequent processes, such as deterioration in handleability due to an increase in wafer weight. Therefore, it is desired to provide a silicon wafer having a thickness as small as possible while reducing the amount of warpage to some extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a silicon wafer capable of reducing the warp of the wafer occurring during a manufacturing process of a semiconductor device such as a 3DNAND and allowing the subsequent processes, which could suffer from problems due to a large warp of the wafer, to be carried out without problems, and manufacturing method therefor.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">To solve the above problems, a silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present invention includes calculating a target thickness of a silicon wafer required for ensuring a warpage reduction amount of the silicon wafer warped during a device process from a relationship between an amount of warpage of a silicon wafer and a thickness of the silicon wafer occurring due to application of the same film stress to a plurality of silicon wafers having mutually different thicknesses, and processing a silicon single crystal ingot to thereby manufacture silicon wafers having the target thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, how much the silicon wafer is warped with what thickness of the silicon wafer applied with an identical film stress can be grasped, whereby it is possible to grasp how much the amount of warpage is reduced when how much the thickness of the wafer is increased. Therefore, the warpage reduction amount of the wafer set beforehand considering the warpage of the wafer occurring during a device process can be actually ensured, allowing the subsequent processes, which have been suffered from problems due to a large warp of the wafer, to be carried out without problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The amount of warpage of the wafer differs depending on the type (tensile stress or compressive stress) of the film stress or actual process conditions and thus cannot be calculated simply from the number of wiring layers. The target warpage reduction amount of the wafer differs depending on the actual warpage amount of the wafer during a device process and the allowable range of the wafer warpage amount in each process. Further, it is not practical to use a wafer having a very large thickness in order to suppress wafer warpage, and it is impossible to completely suppress wafer warpage only by controlling the wafer thickness. Various countermeasures against warping are required to sufficiently reduce the wafer warpage, and the wafer thickness control is merely one of the countermeasures against warping. Thus, it is sufficient to reduce the warpage by, e.g., 10% by the wafer thickness control, and the present invention is effective as a method for solving the problem of the wafer warpage in the device process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present invention calculates a relational formula between the warpage reduction amount of the silicon wafer warped during a device process and the target thickness of the silicon wafer from the relationship between the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer and the thickness thereof, and calculates the target thickness of the silicon wafer by substituting the warpage reduction amount into the relational formula. This allows the wafer target thickness required for ensuring the warpage reduction amount of the silicon wafer to be easily calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present invention, the relational formula preferably satisfies y=A(x/t−1), where y is the warpage reduction amount of the silicon wafer, x is the target thickness of the silicon wafer, t is a standard thickness of the silicon wafer, and A is a constant. In this case, the relationship between the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer and the thickness thereof preferably includes the relationship between the amount of warpage of a silicon wafer having the standard thickness t and the standard thickness t. This allows the wafer target thickness required for ensuring the warpage reduction amount y of the silicon wafer corresponding to the standard thickness of the silicon wafer to be easily calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present invention, the constant A is preferably a value according to the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer occurring due to a device process. This allows the wafer target thickness required for ensuring the warpage reduction amount y of the silicon wafer to be accurately calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In the silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present invention, when the shape of the warp of the silicon wafer occurring due to a difference in the stress component of the films laminated during device formation is a bowl shape, the constant A is preferably equal to or less than 900. This allows a wafer target thickness suitable for reducing the bowl-shaped warp of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present invention, when the shape of the warp of the silicon wafer occurring due to a difference in the stress component of the films laminated during device formation is a saddle shape, the constant A is preferably equal to or less than 1500. This allows a wafer target thickness suitable for reducing the saddle-shaped warp of the wafer to be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the device is preferably a 3DNAND flash memory. As described above, in the 3DNAND flash memory, the stacking number of memory cell arrays is very large, so that the problem of the wafer warpage is conspicuous. That is, when the number of layers increases along with advance of a device process, the wafer warpage also increases, and the amount of warpage exceeds an allowable range before reaching the topmost layer, which may make it impossible to advance the device process further. However, according to the present invention, countermeasures against warping are taken in a wafer state before device formation, so that the problem of the warping can be solved, thus avoiding the situation where it is impossible to advance the device process further.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Effects of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the present invention, there can be provided a silicon wafer manufacturing method capable of reducing the warpage of the wafer occurring during a device process and allowing the subsequent processes, which have been suffered from problems due to a large warp of the wafer, to be carried out without problems.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a silicon wafer manufacturing method according to an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the silicon wafer manufacturing method according to the present embodiment includes: a first step S<b>1</b> of calculating a relationship between an amount of warpage of a silicon wafer and a thickness thereof occurring when the same film stress is applied to a plurality of silicon wafers having mutually different thicknesses; a second step S<b>2</b> of calculating, from the relationship between the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer and the thickness thereof, a relational formula between a warpage reduction amount (y) of a silicon wafer warped during a device process and a target thickness (x) of the silicon wafer; a third step S<b>3</b> of calculating a target thickness (x) of a silicon wafer required for ensuring a warpage reduction amount (y) of the silicon wafer by substituting a desired warpage reduction amount (y) into the relational formula; and a fourth step S<b>4</b> of processing a silicon single crystal ingot to manufacture silicon wafers having the target thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The silicon wafer in the present embodiment refers to a silicon wafer before being subjected to device processing and is a wide concept including not only a general silicon wafer (polished wafer), but also an epitaxial wafer, an anneal wafer, an SOI wafer and the like. The amount of warpage (Warp) of the silicon wafer can be defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values of an error between a reference surface and a measurement surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, a data table showing the relationship between the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer and the thickness thereof includes data indicating the relationship between the amount of warpage of a silicon wafer having a standard thickness and the standard thickness. The standard thickness of the silicon wafer refers to a thickness set based on the diameter of the silicon wafer. For example, the standard thickness of a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm is 775 μm. Thus, since the data indicating the relationship between the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer and the thickness thereof includes the amount of warpage corresponding to the standard thickness of the silicon wafer, reliability of the relational formula between the warpage reduction amount and the target thickness of the silicon wafer can be enhanced to thereby make it possible to accurately and easily calculate the target thickness of the wafer required for ensuring the warpage reduction amount of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The relational formula between the silicon wafer warpage reduction amount (y) and the silicon wafer target thickness (x) can be calculated from the relationship between the silicon wafer warpage amount and the silicon wafer thickness. The relationship between the silicon wafer warpage amount and the silicon wafer thickness is represented by a linear function, and the larger the wafer thickness is, the smaller the amount of warpage becomes. The change rate (slope) of the amount of warpage with respect to the wafer thickness slightly varies depending on the magnitude of the film stress applied to the silicon wafer, but does not vary significantly. The present invention has been made in view of this point and is very effective as an index for reducing the silicon wafer warpage amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">After thus calculating the silicon wafer target thickness, silicon wafers having the calculated target thickness are manufactured. In general, the silicon wafers are manufactured by sequentially applying peripheral grinding, slicing, lapping, etching, double-side polishing, single-side polishing, washing and the like to a silicon single crystal ingot grown by a CZ method. At this time, the slicing conditions or lapping conditions are controlled such that the final thickness of the wafers becomes the target thickness. The thus manufactured silicon wafers are then conveyed to a manufacturing process for a semiconductor device such as a 3DNAND, to become a substrate material for a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, in the semiconductor device manufacturing process, films of various materials such as an oxide film, a nitride film, and a metal film are laminated on a silicon wafer so as to form a device structure on the silicon wafer. These laminated films have different film stresses according to film properties and formation process conditions, which may produce a warp in the silicon wafer depending on the stress of the laminated films. Particularly, the 3DNAND is formed by vertically stacking several tens or more of memory elements, so that, correspondingly the number of laminated films is increased geometrically, with the result that the film stress enormously increases in proportion to the increase in the number of the laminated films, resulting in a significant increase in the silicon wafer warpage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, in the present invention, by theoretically controlling the initial shape of the silicon wafer, warpage occurring during a device process can be reduced, making it possible to carry out the subsequent processes without problems. That is, by providing a silicon wafer having an adequate thickness based on the amount of warpage actually occurring during the semiconductor device process, the amount of warpage can be reduced. Further, it is possible to reduce or prevent defects such as dislocation caused due to the warping of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view for explaining a difference in how the wafer is warped due to the film stress applied to the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when a laminated film such as a wiring layer constituting a semiconductor device is formed on a silicon wafer, a film stress is generated in the silicon wafer, whereby a bowl-shaped warp as illustrated in (a) or a saddle-shaped warp as illustrated in (b) is generated. When such warpage of the wafer becomes severe, various problems arise in the subsequent processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The amount of warpage of the silicon wafer on the surface of which a thin film having a film stress is formed varies according to the thickness of the silicon wafer. In particular, with respect to the same film stress, the larger the wafer thickness is, the smaller the amount of warpage becomes. This can also be seen from the Stoney Equation σ<sub>f</sub>t<sub>f</sub>=E<sub>s</sub>h<sup>2</sup>/6R which is the commonly known relational formula between the film stress and the wafer warp. In the above Stoney Equation, σ<sub>f </sub>is a film stress, t<sub>f </sub>is a film thickness, Es is the Young's modulus of the substrate, h is a substrate thickness, and R is a warp radius.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The reason that the silicon wafer is warped into a saddle shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> during a device process is that the signs of the film stresses of the films formed on the silicon wafer differ from each other to generate anisotropy of the film stress. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when, in addition to a wiring layer in which a compressive stress in the X-direction is dominant, a wiring layer having a tensile stress in the Y-direction perpendicular to the X-direction is formed, the compressive stress in the X-direction is emphasized, with the result that the silicon wafer is warped in a saddle shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The Young's modulus of a silicon crystal varies depending on a crystal orientation, that is, it has orientation dependency. Specifically, the Young's modulus of a silicon crystal is 130 MPa in [100] direction, 170 MPa in [110] direction, and 189 MPa in [111] direction. The smaller the Young's modulus is, the easier deformation occurs. When the wafer is warped in a saddle shape, coincidence between the warp direction of the wafer and the direction of a crystal orientation in which Young's modulus is small makes the wafer more likely to be warped to increase the amount of warpage. Conversely, coincidence between the warping direction of the wafer and the direction of a crystal orientation in which Young's modulus is large makes the wafer more unlikely to be warped to reduce the amount of warpage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The warpage of the wafer occurring when a thin film having a film stress is formed on a silicon wafer can be reproduced by simulation. By calculating the thickness dependency of the silicon wafer with respect to the same film stress by simulation according to a finite element method, the relational formula between the thickness of a silicon wafer and the amount of warpage thereof can be calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The relationship between the amount of warpage of a silicon wafer occurring in device formation involving film lamination and the thickness thereof is thus calculated, and the thickness x of the silicon wafer and the warpage reduction amount y are formulated by the relational formula: y=A(x/t−1). In this formula, t is the standard thickness (μm) of the silicon wafer, and, for example, the standard thickness of a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm is 775 μm. The formula is formed for both the bowl shape and saddle shape of the warping (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) occurring due to the difference in the stress component of the films laminated during device formation. Then, the thickness of the wafer according to the warpage reduction amount desired to be obtained in the device process is derived from the relational formula between the thickness of the silicon wafer and the warpage reduction amount. Then, silicon wafers having the thus derived thickness are manufactured. The silicon wafers are manufactured by processing a silicon single crystal ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The constant A in the relational formula between the thickness of the silicon wafer and the warpage reduction amount is preferably set to a value according to the amount of warpage of the wafer occurring due to a device process. In this case, when the silicon wafer is warped in a bowl shape, the constant A is preferably equal to or less than 900. Further, when the silicon wafer is warped in a saddle shape, the constant A is preferably equal to or less than 1500.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, according to the silicon wafer manufacturing method of the present embodiment, in a silicon wafer on the surface of which a semiconductor device is formed, the warpage amount of the silicon wafer occurring due to the film stress of the laminated film such as a wiring layer formed on the silicon wafer can be reduced to equal to or less than a predetermined value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">While the present invention has been described based on the preferred embodiment, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are included in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, although the silicon wafer manufacturing method suitable for manufacture of a 3DNAND has been described in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this and may be applied to silicon wafers for various semiconductor devices in which the wafer may be warped due to the film stress.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading id="h-0012">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As a result of forming a silicon oxide film of 2 μm thickness on a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm and a thickness of 775 μm by a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, a convex bowl-shaped warp occurred toward the film formation surface of the wafer. The amount of warpage (Warp) of the wafer was measured using a wafer flatness/shape measuring device to be 610 μm (standard warpage amount).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The silicon oxide film was formed in the similar manner on silicon wafers having thicknesses of 800 μm, 825 μm and 850 μm, and the amounts of warpage of the respective wafers were measured to be 585 μm, 560 μm and 535 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating the relationship between the thickness of a silicon wafer and the amount of warpage thereof. The horizontal axis represents the thickness of the silicon wafer, and the vertical axis represents the amount of warpage thereof. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the film stress is constant, the larger the thickness of the silicon wafer, the smaller the amount of warpage becomes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph illustrating the relationship between the thickness of a silicon wafer and the warpage reduction amount which is obtained by converting the graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The horizontal axis represents the thickness of the silicon wafer, and the vertical axis represents the warpage reduction amount. The graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates how much the amount of warpage is reduced when how much the wafer thickness is increased with the amount of warpage of the silicon wafer having the standard thickness (775 μm) set as a reference (zero). When the graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is represented by the relational formula between the target thickness x of the silicon wafer and the warpage reduction amount y: y=A(x/775−1), the following formula is obtained.
<br/>
<i>y=</i>760.5(<i>x/</i>775−1)  (formula 1)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The above relational formula means that when a target warpage reduction amount is substituted into y, the wafer thickness x required for improving the amount of warpage can be calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, a confirmation experiment was performed using the above relational formula. When the target warpage reduction amount y=35 μm is substituted into the relational formula: y=760.5(x/775−1), the target thickness x of the silicon wafer=810.67 μm is obtained. Then, when a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm and a thickness of 810.2 μm was prepared, and a silicon oxide film having a thickness of 2 μm was formed thereon by the CVD process, a convex bowl-shaped warp occurred in the wafer. The amount of warpage was 572.2 μm. The actual warpage reduction amount was 610−572.2=37.8 μm. Since the target warpage reduction amount is y=35 μm, the obtained result nearly complies with the target value.</div>
