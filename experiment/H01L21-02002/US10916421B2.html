<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods of manufacturing epitaxial silicon wafers, particularly to a method of manufacturing an epitaxial wafer allowing reduction of carbon concentration (measurement intensity) in a grown epitaxial film.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">For devices based on an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), utilizing both electrons and holes as carriers, for example, highly required is lowering concentration of carbon in epitaxial films. Namely, suppression of intake of carbon component into epitaxial films is one of the most crucial requirements in epitaxial silicon wafer manufacturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the reasons for the high concentration of carbon in the epitaxial film can be attributed to a fact that carbon component contained in the processing gas contacting with members in a chamber is taken into the epitaxial film during growing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Another reason is thought that purging gas flowing under the susceptor holding a silicon wafer contains carbon component by contacting with the members of the chamber and swirls up above the susceptor, and thereby the carbon may be taken into the film component on the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">That is to say, control of the gas in the chamber gives large influences upon the carbon concentration in the epitaxial film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">An attempt to control the gas flow while film forming is a gas-phase growing method disclosed in JP-A-2007-326761. In the gas-phase growing method disclosed in JP-A-2007-326761, when an epitaxial film is grown on a wafer mounted on a susceptor in a reaction chamber <b>200</b> having a gas inlet <b>201</b> and a gas outlet <b>202</b> for a processing gas, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a processing gas is supplied along a front side of the susceptor <b>205</b> and at the same time a purging gas is introduced along a rotation axis <b>206</b> supporting the susceptor <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The processing gas passing along the front side of the susceptor is exhausted through the gas outlet <b>202</b> on the front side of the susceptor and the purging gas is exhausted from a purging gas outlet <b>207</b> provided on a back surface of the susceptor; this enable to make no pressure difference between the front side and the back side of the susceptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">A narrow gap <b>208</b> for communicating an upper and lower space separated by the susceptor <b>205</b> is formed on an outer periphery of the susceptor <b>205</b>; this structure reduces the pressure difference and this causes to restrict a gas flow due to the pressure difference, and the gas flow hardly occurs. Consequently, contamination in a growing epitaxial film due to flowing of the purging gas into the upper space is prohibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">With this configuration that a space in the chamber is separated by the susceptor <b>205</b> into the upper space and the lower space, the gas flow in the chamber is easily controllable and the carbon concentration in the epitaxial film grown on a wafer W also becomes controllable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The gas-phase grown method disclosed in JP-A-2007-326761, however, fails to consider balancing of the gases flowing above the susceptor and below the susceptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">When a flow rate ratio of the purging gas to processing gas is larger than a predetermined value, a purging gas flow into the upper space through the narrow gap <b>208</b> increases and this may cause an atmospheric gas containing carbon component to swirl up. As a result, there arises a problem of increasing carbon concentration in the epitaxial film formed on the wafer W.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the above problem and it is an object to provide a method of manufacturing epitaxial silicon wafers, which method enables to reduce carbon concentration in an epitaxial film when the epitaxial film on a silicon wafer is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The method of manufacturing epitaxial silicon wafers according to the present invention to achieve the above object is that an epitaxial film is formed on a surface of a silicon wafer in a reaction chamber having a wafer-holding susceptor that separates an upper and lower space communicating through a predetermined gap, in which chamber a flow of a processing gas laterally along an upper surface of the wafer is formed in the upper space and a flow of a main purging gas flowing towards the susceptor upwardly in the lower space is formed simultaneously, and a flow rate ratio of the main purging gas flow rate to the processing gas flow rate is set to be 1.0/100 to 1.5/100 when the processing gas flow rate is set as 100, and a pressure in the upper space is at least controlled to be within an atmospheric pressure ±0.2 kPa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The gap is formed between an inner periphery of an annular preheating ring disposed along the outer periphery of the susceptor and the outer periphery of the susceptor, and a position in height of the susceptor is desirably set to be within −3 mm to +0 mm relative to a position in height of the preheating ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">A slit purging gas flow is formed from a slit that functions as a transfer gate of silicon wafers for the reaction chamber, flowing in the lower space, and when the processing gas flow rate is set as a base of 100, a flow rate ratio of the flow rate of the main purging gas flowing in the lower space to the slit purging gas flow rate is desirably set to be equal to or less than 20.5/100.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">By controlling the flow rate ratio of the flow rate of the purging gas flowing in the lower space of the reaction chamber to the flow rate of the processing gas flowing in the upper space thereof, this configuration enables to suppress swirling up of an atmospheric gas containing carbon component and to reduce carbon concentration in the epitaxial films.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a CVD apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with a buffer chamber <b>101</b> which temporally keep a plurality of wafers and a process chambers <b>102</b>A to <b>102</b>C disposed along an outer periphery of the buffer chamber <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The CVD apparatus <b>101</b> further includes two load lock chambers <b>103</b>A and <b>103</b>B disposed along the outer periphery of the buffer chamber <b>101</b> and one cooling chamber <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The buffer chamber <b>101</b> includes a transfer robot <b>101</b> <i>a </i>at the inside. The transfer robot <b>101</b> <i>a </i>conveys a wafer W between load lock chambers <b>103</b>A and <b>103</b>B and process chambers <b>102</b>A through <b>102</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The load lock chambers <b>103</b>A or <b>103</b>B is provided in order to separate a cleanroom atmosphere and atmospheres in the load lock chambers <b>103</b>A or <b>103</b>B and beyond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">When wafers W are brought from a wafer transfer container (not shown) in a cleanroom into the load lock chamber <b>103</b>A or <b>103</b>B, the chamber is depressurized once and then purged with N<sub>2 </sub>gas. After the chamber has become atmospheric pressure, the wafers W are to be transferred by a transfer robot <b>101</b> <i>a </i>to any one of processing chambers <b>102</b>A to <b>102</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The cooling chamber <b>104</b> is used to cool the wafers W while transferring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each of the processing chambers includes an epitaxial film forming chamber <b>2</b> (hereinafter simply referred to as a film forming chamber <b>2</b>). The film forming chamber <b>2</b> is a space formed with a disk-shaped ceiling <b>3</b> and a bottom part <b>4</b> of an inverted cone shape, the peripheries of which are supported by a supporting frame <b>5</b>. The ceiling <b>3</b> and the bottom part <b>4</b> are made of quartz glass, for example, and a silicon wafer substrate W mounted at the inside of the film forming chamber <b>2</b> is to be heated by a halogen lamp (not shown) disposed at an upper and lower part of the chamber. A susceptor <b>6</b> on which the silicon wafer substrate is to be mounted is disposed in the film forming chamber. The susceptor <b>6</b> is supported by a rotating axis <b>7</b> from the below so as to rotate with the mounted silicon wafer substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The space of the film forming chamber <b>2</b> is divided by the susceptor <b>6</b> approximately by half, thereby forming an upper space <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and a lower space <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. An upper surface of the silicon wafer substrate W, mounted on the susceptor <b>6</b> as described above, is a principal surface on which an epitaxial film is to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The supporting frame <b>5</b> is provided with a gas inlet <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to introduce a processing gas above the susceptor, that is, into the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, and a gas outlet <b>5</b> <i>b </i>disposed at the opposite side of the supporting frame <b>5</b> to oppose to the gas inlet <b>5</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">A processing gas is introduced from the gas inlet <b>5</b> <i>a </i>into the film forming chamber in order to flow laterally along the surface of the silicon wafer substrate W, which processing gas is a silicon source gas (raw material gas) such as dichlorosilane SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>or trichlorosilane SiHCl<sub>3 </sub>diluted with hydrogen gas H<sub>2 </sub>as a carrier gas and added with a very small amount of a dopant. After passing along the silicon wafer surface to form an epitaxial film, the supplied gas is discharged from the gas outlet <b>5</b> <i>b </i>to the outside of the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, an annular preheating ring <b>11</b> is provided at the inner periphery of the supporting frame <b>5</b> and the susceptor <b>6</b> is disposed with a predetermined gap <b>10</b> from the inner periphery of the preheating ring; that is, the outer circumference of the susceptor <b>6</b> is surrounded by the preheating ring <b>11</b>. Described in more detail, the periphery of the susceptor is arranged with a height difference of −3 mm to +0 mm from the inner periphery of the preheating ring; this determines the dimension of the gap <b>10</b>. By making such a height difference between the preheating ring <b>11</b> and the susceptor <b>6</b>, an effect of suppressing flow turbulence of the processing gas can be obtained. In addition, the susceptor <b>6</b> can be rotatable owing to the gap <b>10</b> and the gap <b>10</b> becomes a communicating path that communicates the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a </i>with the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the susceptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, hydrogen gas H2 as a purging gas is introduced from a lower portion of the rotating axis <b>7</b>, flows toward the susceptor upwardly, expands along the bottom part <b>4</b> of the inverted cone shape, and partially flows like swirling following the rotation of the rotating axis <b>7</b> and the susceptor <b>6</b>. The purging gas further flows up to the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a </i>passing through the gap <b>10</b> and is discharged to the outside from the gas outlet <b>5</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a slit <b>12</b> is formed at a gate area connecting with the buffer chamber <b>101</b>, and the purging gas flows through the slit <b>12</b> toward the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. This is aimed to prevent the slit <b>12</b> from being damaged by the processing gas which enters the slit <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, a method of forming an epitaxial film on a Si wafer W using thus constructed CVD apparatus <b>100</b> will be explained following along a series of events.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">When a Si wafer substrate W is transferred to the load lock chamber <b>103</b>, for example, from a wafer transfer container (not shown), the inside of the chamber is once depressurized and purged with N<sub>2 </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">When the load lock chamber restores to the atmospheric pressure, the transfer robot <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the buffer chamber <b>101</b> receives the wafer W from the load lock chamber <b>103</b>A and then mount the wafer on the susceptor <b>6</b> of the process chamber <b>102</b>B, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Then a depressurized film forming room is formed in the process chamber <b>102</b>B. The pressure in the upper area <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is controlled to be in a range of the atmospheric pressure ±0.2 kPa; this is to suppress a flow turbulence of the processing gas in the chamber that may be a cause of swirling up of the atmospheric gas containing carbon component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The processing gas is introduced from the gas inlet <b>5</b> <i>a </i>at a predetermined flow rate, 30 slm to 60 slm, for example, where slm stands for standard litter per minute, and flows parallel to the upper surface of the wafer and then is discharged from the gas outlet <b>5</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, the purging gas is introduced from a supply port (not shown) placed below the rotating axis <b>7</b>. The introduced purging gas, called a main purging gas, flows toward the susceptor <b>6</b> and spreads along the spreading of the cone-like shape of the bottom part <b>4</b>. Then the purging gas flows to the upper area <b>2</b> <i>a </i>through a gap between the preheating ring <b>11</b> and the susceptor <b>6</b> and discharged from the gas outlet <b>5</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In this case, when letting the processing gas flow rate be as a base of 100, a flow rate ratio of the main purging gas flow rate, flowing in the lower area <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, to the processing gas flow rate is set to be 1.0/100 to 1.5/100. This is because when the ratio of the purging gas to the processing gas is less than 1.0/100 the inside of the chamber is likely to be metal-contaminated and when the ratio exceeds 1.5/100 the atmospheric gas containing carbon component is likely to be swirled up.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A predetermined amount of purging gas, called a slit purging gas, is flown toward the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b </i>from a slit <b>12</b> formed at a connecting gate area of the supporting frame <b>5</b> and the buffer chamber <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, when letting the processing gas flow rate, flowing in the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, be as a base of 100, a ratio of an added flow rate of the slit purging gas and the main purging gas to the processing gas flow rate is set to be equal to or less than 20.5/100. This enables to achieve a pressure balance between upper and lower boundary region of the susceptor to make pressure of the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a </i>larger than the pressure of the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b </i>and to suppress swirling up of the atmospheric gas containing carbon into the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus achieving a flow control of gases enables to form an epitaxial film controlled to have a low carbon concentration on the surface of the wafers W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">As described in an embodiment according to the present invention, in a CVD apparatus where the inside of the chamber is almost separated by the susceptor on which a Si wafer is to be mounted into an upper and a lower spaces, controlling of the ratio of the purging gas, flowing in the lower space <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, to the processing gas, flowing in the upper space <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, enables to suppress swirling up of the atmospheric gas containing carbon component and to decrease the carbon concentration in the epitaxial film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The manufacturing method of epitaxial Si wafers according to the present invention will be explained on a basis of the example. In the example, the following experiments were performed based on the embodiment.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0061">In Experiment 2, under the favorable condition defined by the results of Experiment 1, carbon concentration contained in the epitaxial films against the flow rate of purging gas in the lower space of the chamber is evaluated using photoluminescence (PL) measurement method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0062">In Embodiment 14, the ratio of the flow rate of the main purging gas in a lower space to the flow rate, set as 100, of the processing gas in the upper space was set to be 1.25/100 with a flow rate of 0.5 slm. The pressure in the chamber was set to be in a range of the atmospheric pressure ±0.2 kPa and the susceptor height with respect to the height of the preheat ring was set to be in a range of −3 mm to 0 mm.
