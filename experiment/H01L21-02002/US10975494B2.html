<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase Patent Application of International Application Number PCT/KR2017/005635, filed on May 30, 2017, which claims priority of Korean Patent Application Number 10-2016-0165509, filed on Dec. 7, 2016, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">Technical Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ingot growth control device capable of quickly and accurately controlling a diameter of an ingot during an ingot growing process and improving quality of the ingot, and a control method thereof.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Background Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">In order to fabricate a wafer, a single crystal silicon should be grown in an ingot form, and quality of the wafer is directly affected by quality of a silicon ingot, and thus an advanced process control technology from the time of growing the single crystal ingot is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">The Czochralski (CZ) crystal growth method is mainly used for growing a silicon single crystal ingot. An important factor that directly affects quality of a grown single crystal by using this method is known as V/G which is a ratio of a crystal growth speed (V) and a temperature gradient (G) at a solid-liquid interface. Therefore, it is important to control the V/G to a target trajectory value set over the entire zone of a crystal growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">A control system according to the CZ method is basically configured to change an actual pulling speed to match a target pulling speed by a change amount read by a current diameter monitoring system and a calculation through a PID controller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">Normally, a basic principle is that a diameter (Dia) of an ingot is measured during a single crystal ingot growing process, and when there is a difference between the measured diameter (Dia) and a target diameter (T_Dia), a pulling speed (P/S) of the ingot is corrected to make the diameter (Dia) of the ingot close to a reference value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">Therefore, the ingot growth control system may be expressed by the pulling speed control according to a change in the diameter of the ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">Korean Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2013-0008175 discloses an ingot growth control device in which a high-resolution temperature controller corrects heater power in real time by reflecting an error between an average pulling speed calculated by a diameter controller and a target pulling speed input separately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">Korean Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2014-0113175 discloses a temperature control device of an ingot growth device that a temperature automatic design controller considers quantitatively a pulling speed error (ΔP/S<sub>0</sub>) and an actual temperature profile (Act ATC<sub>0</sub>) of a previous ingot growing process and an actual temperature profile (Act ATC1) of a current ingot growing process by reflecting an error between an average pulling speed calculated by a diameter controller and a target pulling speed input separately to automatically design a target temperature profile (Target ATC) of a current ingot growing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a configuration diagram illustrating an example of an ingot growth control device according to the related art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0011">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the ingot growth control device according to the related art measures a diameter (Dia) of an ingot and inputs the measured diameter (Dia) and a target diameter (T_Dia) to an auto diameter controller <b>1</b>, the auto diameter controller <b>1</b> controls the diameter of the ingot by outputting the measured diameter (Dia) and the target diameter (T_Dia) at an actual pulling speed (P/S) and controlling a pulling speed of the ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Next, when an average pulling speed (Avg. P/S) obtained by averaging the actual pulling speeds from the auto diameter controller <b>1</b> is input to an auto growth controller <b>2</b>, the auto growth controller <b>2</b> outputs a temperature correction amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">Next, when the temperature correction amount is input from the auto growth controller <b>2</b> to an auto temperature controller <b>3</b>, the auto temperature controller <b>3</b> outputs heater power to control power of a heater, thereby controlling quality of the ingot. As described above, even though the diameter (Dia) of the ingot is measured in order to control the diameter and the quality of the ingot, there is a problem that a response time required to control the diameter and the quality of the ingot actually increases because it takes several steps to reflect a diameter error (ΔDia) and to correct the power of the heater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0014">In addition, according to the related art, it takes about 1 to 5 minutes to control the diameter of the ingot by changing the pulling speed to reflect the diameter error of the ingot. On the other hand, even though the power of the heater is controlled to reflect the diameter error of the ingot, it takes about 20 minutes to affect the actual ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0015">Therefore, since a temperature environment further affects the ingot after the diameter of the ingot is controlled, the diameter and the quality of the ingot are overcorrected, and thus it is difficult to obtain a desired ingot diameter and quality.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0019">In an ingot growth control device and a control method thereof according to the present invention, when an input unit provides diameter data obtained by filtering a diameter measurement value of an ingot, a diameter controller controls a pulling speed of the ingot by reflecting the diameter data, while a temperature controller controls power of a heater by reflecting the diameter data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0020">Accordingly, the pulling speed of the ingot and the power of the heater are controlled independently by the diameter controller and the temperature controller, thereby controlling the diameter and quality of the ingot quickly and accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0021">In addition, a dispersion of the diameter of the ingot may be improved, and a variation of the pulling speed for controlling the diameter of the ingot may be reduced, thereby improving a crystal quality level.</div>

For this, the temperature controller <b>230</b> applies an output multiple proportional to the pulling speed error of the diameter controller <b>220</b> to the previously calculated heater power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0062">In an embodiment, when the pulling speed (P/S) of the single crystal ingot controlled by the diameter controller <b>220</b> deviates from an error range of 1 to 10% of the target pulling speed (T_P/S), the temperature controller <b>230</b> applies an output multiple to the previously calculated heater power, and the output multiple may be determined to be −100 times to +100 times so as to be proportional to a degree of deviation from an error range, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an ingot growth control method according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0064">The ingot growth control method according to the present invention measures a diameter of an ingot as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and calculates diameter data by filtering a diameter measurement value (see S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0065">In an embodiment, the diameter of the ingot at a silicon melt interface may be measured by a diameter measurement sensor such as an infrared camera or a CCD camera.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0066">In an embodiment, accuracy and reliability of the diameter data may be increased and simultaneously, a response speed may be increased by calculating a diameter measurement value as the diameter data by a sensor filter such as a polynomial filter or a prediction filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0067">Next, a diameter error (ΔDia) according to the diameter data and a previously inputted target diameter (T_Dia) is calculated, and the diameter error (ΔDia) is provided for simultaneously controlling a pulling speed (P/S) and heater power (see S<b>3</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0068">Next, the pulling speed (P/S) is calculated and output according to the diameter error (ΔDia) and a target pulling speed (T_P/S) (see S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0069">In an embodiment, the pulling speed (P/S) is controlled so as to match the target pulling speed (T_P/S) while eliminating the diameter error (ΔDia), and the pulling speed may be calculated by a pulling speed PID equation including a function of a first delay time and a first reaction time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0070">At this time, the first delay time is a time from a time point when the pulling speed (P/S) is outputted to a time point when a diameter of an actual ingot begins to be controlled, and the first reaction time is a time from the time point when the diameter of the ingot begins to be controlled to a time point when the diameter of the ingot reaches 63% of a final converging diameter of the ingot, and the first delay time and the first reaction time are input as previously set values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0071">In addition, the first delay time and the first reaction time may be accumulated and stored as real-time measurement values. When an error between the accumulated and stored value and the previously set value occurs at least ten times or more, the value is automatically updated to the accumulated and stored value, and thus the diameter of the ingot may be controlled quickly and accurately according to the pulling speed (P/S).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0072">Meanwhile, the heater power is calculated and output according to the diameter error (ΔDia) and a target temperature (T_temp) (see S<b>6</b> and S<b>7</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0073">In an embodiment, the heater power is controlled so as to match the target temperature (T_temp) while eliminating the diameter error (ΔDia), and the heater power may be calculated by a heater power PID equation including a function of a second delay time and a second reaction time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0074">At this time, the second delay time is a time from a time point when the heater power is outputted to a time point when a diameter of an actual ingot begins to be controlled, and the second reaction time is a time from the time point when the diameter of the ingot begins to be controlled to a time point when the diameter of the ingot reaches 63% of a final converging diameter of the ingot, and the second delay time and the second reaction time are input as previously set values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0075">In addition, the second delay time and the second reaction time may be accumulated and stored as real-time measurement values. When an error between the accumulated and stored value and the previously set value occurs at least ten times or more, the value is automatically updated to the accumulated and stored value, and thus the quality of the ingot may be controlled and simultaneously, the diameter of the ingot may be controlled quickly and accurately according to the heater power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0076">However, when the pulling speed (P/S) is excessively different from the target pulling speed (T_P/S), the heater power is controlled in conjunction with the pulling speed (P/S), and thus it is possible to quickly and accurately match the diameter of the ingot to the target diameter (T_Dia).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0077">Therefore, when the error between the pulling speed (P/S) and the target pulling speed (T_P/S) deviates from a set range, an output multiple is calculated and the heater power is corrected in consideration of the output multiple, and then the output is finally output (see S<b>8</b>, S<b>9</b>, and S<b>10</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0078">In an embodiment, when the pulling speed (P/S) is out of a range of 1 to 10% of the target pulling speed (T_P/S), the output multiple is calculated within a range of −100 times to 100 times, and final heater power may be calculated by multiplying pre-calculated heater power by the output multiple.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0079">Of course, when the error between the pulling speed (P/S) and the target pulling speed (T_P/S) is within the set range, the pre-calculated heater power is maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are graphs illustrating a diameter of an ingot and an error of a pulling speed during a process according to the related art and the present invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view illustrating crystal quality results of an ingot grown according to the related art and the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0081">According to the related art, since the pulling speed is output as a diameter measurement value of the ingot is input to an auto diameter controller, and an average value of the pulling speed is output into heater power sequentially through an auto growth controller and an auto temperature controller, it takes a long time to output the heater power as compared with the pulling speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0082">On the other hand, according to the present invention, since the diameter measurement value of the ingot is supplied to the diameter controller and the temperature controller simultaneously after being filtered at the input unit, and the pulling speed and the heater power are output independently from the diameter controller and the temperature controller, the pulling speed and the heater power are output almost simultaneously and quickly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0083">When the ingot is grown on the basis of the target diameter of 306 mm according to the related art and the present invention, a diameter deviation of the ingot grown according to the related art as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown at an average of 0.84 mm, whereas the diameter deviation of the ingot grown according to the present invention is shown at an average of 0.31 mm, and it can be seen that the diameter deviation of the ingot is improved by about 63.3% as compared to the related art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0084">Therefore, since the ingot grown according to the present invention shows a small diameter deviation by position, productivity can be improved even though a back-end process such as grinding is not performed separately in order to eliminate the diameter deviation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0085">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an error of the pulling speed according to the related art is shown at an average of 0.034 mm/min, whereas an error of the pulling speed according to the present invention is shown at an average of 0.015 mm/min, and it can be seen that the error of the pulling speed is improved by about 56.8% as compared to the related art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0086">Therefore, a process according to the present invention significantly reduces the error of the pulling speed, so that the quality of the ingot may be uniformly improved for each length, and may be confirmed by a score of a copper haze scoring as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0087">A copper haze evaluation method is an evaluation method in which copper is contaminated on one side of a wafer or a single crystal silicon piece at a high concentration by using a copper contamination solution which is a mixed solution of buffered oxide etchant (BOE) solution and copper, and short diffusion heat treatment is performed, and then the contaminated side or the opposite side of the contaminated side is observed with the naked eye under a condensing lamp, to distinguish a crystal defect region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0088">A cross section of a wafer or single crystal ingot may be divided into an O-band region, a vacancy dominant point defect zone (VDP) region, an interstitial dominant point defect zone (IDP) region, and a loop dominant point defect zone (LDP) region through a first heat treatment (BP) and a second heat treatment (BSW) by such a copper haze (Cu Hz) evaluation method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0089">In addition, the score of the copper haze scoring may be assigned to a region as described above by using the Cu Hz evaluation method, and the score of the copper haze scoring may be assigned from 0 to 300.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0090">Recently, since a demand for quality of an ingot is high, the quality is controlled at a level in which only the VDP region and the IDP region, which are defect free regions where the O-band region is controlled, are shown over an entire zone of the ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0091">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an ingot manufactured according to the related art includes a lot of O-band regions with an average of 160 (O-band level)±40 pt level of a copper haze scoring score over the entire zone thereof, whereas an ingot manufactured according to the present invention is shown to include only an IDP region and a VDP region with an average of 80 (IDP/VDP level)±10 pt level of a copper haze scoring score over an entire zone thereof, and it can be seen that the quality of the ingot is significantly improved compared to the related art and the quality of the ingot is uniformly controlled over the entire zone.</div>
