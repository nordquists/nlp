<heading id="h-0002">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wafer producing apparatus for producing an SiC wafer from a single crystal SiC ingot.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Various devices such as integrated circuits (ICs), large scale integrated circuits (LSIs), and light emitting diodes (LEDs) are formed by forming a functional layer on the front side of a wafer formed of Si (silicon) or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(sapphire) and partitioning this functional layer into a plurality of separate regions along a plurality of division lines. Further, power devices or optical devices such as LEDs are formed by forming a functional layer on the front side of a wafer formed of single crystal SiC (silicon carbide) and partitioning this functional layer into a plurality of separate regions along a plurality of division lines. The division lines of such a wafer having these devices are processed by a processing apparatus such as a cutting apparatus and a laser processing apparatus to thereby divide the wafer into a plurality of individual device chips corresponding to the respective devices. The device chips thus obtained are used in various electrical equipment such as mobile phones and personal computers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the wafer on which the devices are to be formed is produced by slicing a cylindrical semiconductor ingot with a wire saw. Both sides of the wafer sliced from the ingot are polished to a mirror finish (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-94221, for example). However, when the ingot is cut by the wire saw and both sides of each wafer are polished to obtain the product, a large proportion (70% to 80%) of the ingot is discarded to cause a problem of poor economy. In particular, a single crystal SiC ingot has high hardness and it is therefore difficult to cut this SiC ingot with the wire saw. Accordingly, considerable time is required for cutting of the SiC ingot, causing a reduction in productivity. Furthermore, since this SiC ingot is high in unit price, there is a problem in efficiently producing an SiC wafer in this prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A technique for solving this problem has been proposed (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2013-49161, for example). This technique includes the steps of setting the focal point of a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to single crystal SiC inside a single crystal SiC ingot, next applying the laser beam to the SiC ingot to thereby form a separation layer in a given plane previously set inside the SiC ingot, and next breaking the SiC ingot along the given plane where the separation layer has been formed, thus separating an SiC wafer from the SiC ingot.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the step of forming the separation layer inside the SiC ingot, the step of separating the SiC wafer from the SiC ingot, and the step of grinding the upper surface of the SiC ingot to thereby flatten the upper surface of the SiC ingot are all performed manually, causing a reduction in production efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a wafer producing apparatus which can automatically produce an SiC wafer from a single crystal SiC ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a wafer producing apparatus for producing an SiC wafer from a single crystal SiC ingot, the wafer producing apparatus including a holding unit for holding the ingot; a flattening unit for grinding the upper surface of the ingot held by the holding unit, thereby flattening the upper surface of the ingot; a laser applying unit for setting the focal point of a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to the ingot inside the ingot at a predetermined depth from the upper surface of the ingot held by the holding unit, the predetermined depth corresponding to the thickness of the wafer to be produced, and next applying the laser beam to the ingot to thereby form a separation layer for separating the wafer from the ingot; a wafer separating unit for holding the upper surface of the ingot to separate the wafer from the ingot along the separation layer; and a wafer storing unit for storing the wafer separated from the ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the wafer producing apparatus further includes an ingot storing unit for storing the ingot and an ingot transfer unit for transferring the ingot from the ingot storing unit to the holding unit. Preferably, the wafer producing apparatus further includes a cleaning unit for cleaning the ingot processed by the flattening unit. Preferably, the holding unit is provided on a turn table, so that when the turn table is rotated, the holding unit is positioned sequentially below the flattening unit, the laser applying unit, and the wafer separating unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the wafer producing apparatus of the present invention, the wafer can be automatically produced from the ingot and then stored into the wafer storing unit. Accordingly, the production efficiency can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the invention.</div>

Each chuck table <b>20</b> is rotatable about its axis extending in the Z direction through the radial center of each chuck table <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The four chuck tables <b>20</b> are arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction of the turn table <b>18</b> (i.e., at 90-degree intervals), and partitioned by a crossing partition wall <b>18</b> <i>a </i>provided on the upper surface of the turn table <b>18</b>.

The vacuum chuck <b>22</b> has an upper surface present in a substantially horizontal plane. The vacuum chuck <b>22</b> of each chuck table <b>20</b> is connected through a suction passage to a suction unit (not shown).

The grinding water supplied to the grinding area is drained through a drain opening <b>16</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the outside of the wafer producing apparatus <b>2</b>, in which the drain opening <b>16</b> <i>b </i>is formed in the turn table accommodating portion <b>16</b> of the base <b>14</b> at a position adjacent to the flattening unit <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">After performing the flattening step for the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a</i>, performing the wafer separating step for the third ingot <b>150</b> <i>c</i>, performing the wafer transfer step for the wafer <b>172</b> produced from the third ingot <b>150</b> <i>c</i>, and performing the separation layer forming step for the fourth ingot <b>150</b> <i>d</i>, the turn table <b>18</b> is rotated by the turn table motor by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction as viewed in plan. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the chuck table <b>20</b> holding the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a </i>is moved from the flattening position P<b>2</b> to the separation layer forming position P<b>3</b>, the chuck table <b>20</b> holding the second ingot <b>150</b> <i>b </i>is moved from the standby position P<b>1</b> to the flattening position P<b>2</b>, the chuck table <b>20</b> holding the third ingot <b>150</b> <i>c </i>is moved from the wafer separating position P<b>4</b> to the standby position P<b>1</b>, and the chuck table <b>20</b> holding the fourth ingot <b>150</b> <i>d </i>is moved from the separation layer forming position P<b>3</b> to the wafer separating position P<b>4</b>. Just after performing the flattening step for the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a</i>, the cleaning unit <b>50</b> is operated to clean the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a </i>in the following manner as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The cleaning water <b>55</b> is discharged obliquely downward toward the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a </i>from each nozzle hole of the first cleaning portion <b>54</b> to thereby remove a grinding dust from the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a</i>. Thereafter, the compressed air <b>57</b> is discharged downward from each nozzle hole of the second cleaning portion <b>56</b> to thereby remove the cleaning water <b>55</b> from the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a </i>processed by the flattening unit <b>6</b> is cleaned and dried by the cleaning unit <b>50</b>. After cleaning the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a</i>, the separation layer forming step is performed for the first ingot <b>150</b> <i>a </i>by using the laser applying unit <b>8</b>. Further, the flattening step is performed for the second ingot <b>150</b> <i>b </i>by using the flattening unit <b>6</b>. Further, the wafer separating step is performed for the fourth ingot <b>150</b> <i>d </i>by using the wafer separating unit <b>10</b>, and the wafer transfer step is performed for the wafer <b>172</b> produced from the fourth ingot <b>150</b> <i>d</i>, by using the wafer transfer unit <b>118</b>. Further, the third ingot <b>150</b> <i>c </i>moved from the wafer separating position P<b>4</b> to the standby position P<b>1</b> waits at the standby position P<b>1</b> until the turn table <b>18</b> is next rotated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Thereafter, every time the turn table <b>18</b> is rotated by the turn table motor by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction as viewed in plan, each chuck table <b>20</b> is sequentially set at the standby position P<b>1</b>, the flattening position P<b>2</b>, the separation layer forming position P<b>3</b>, and the wafer separating position P<b>4</b>. Thereafter, the flattening step, the separation layer forming step, and the wafer separating step are repeatedly performed for each ingot <b>150</b> held on each chuck table <b>20</b>. Further, the wafer transfer step is performed for each wafer <b>172</b> separated by the wafer separating unit <b>10</b>. Accordingly, an obtainable number of wafers <b>172</b> are produced from each ingot <b>150</b>, and the wafers <b>172</b> thus produced are stored into the wafer storing unit <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">After producing an obtainable number of wafers <b>172</b> from each ingot <b>150</b>, a substrate recovering step may be performed to recover the substrate <b>164</b> on which a part of the ingot <b>150</b> is slightly left. A suitable recovery container <b>176</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) for recovering the substrate <b>164</b> is located on the upper surface of the base <b>14</b> at the front end portion thereof in the vicinity of the ingot transfer unit <b>134</b>. The substrate <b>164</b> is transferred to the substrate recovery container <b>176</b> by) the ingot transfer unit <b>134</b>. More specifically, in the substrate recovering step, the arm moving mechanism <b>140</b> of the ingot transfer unit <b>134</b> is operated to move the arm <b>138</b> in the Y direction and thereby position the suction member <b>146</b> directly above the substrate <b>164</b> set at the standby position P<b>1</b>. Thereafter, the air cylinder <b>144</b> of the ingot transfer unit <b>134</b> is operated to lower the suction member <b>146</b> and bring the lower surface of the suction member <b>146</b> into close contact with the upper surface of the substrate <b>164</b>. Thereafter, the suction unit connected to the suction member <b>146</b> is operated to apply a suction force to the lower surface of the suction member <b>146</b>, thereby holding the upper surface of the substrate <b>164</b> on the lower surface of the suction member <b>146</b> under suction. Thereafter, the air cylinder <b>144</b> is operated to raise the suction member <b>146</b> holding the substrate <b>164</b>. Thereafter, the arm moving mechanism <b>140</b> is operated to move the arm <b>138</b> in the Y direction and thereby position the suction member <b>146</b> directly above the recovery container <b>176</b>.

Thereafter, the turn table <b>18</b> is rotated by the turn table motor to sequentially move the substrate <b>164</b> to the standby position P<b>1</b>.
