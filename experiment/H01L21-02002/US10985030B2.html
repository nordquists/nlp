<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES289697983">
<heading id="h-0001">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">There have been proposed so far various designs regarding semiconductor devices including semiconductor elements such as transistors. An example of such semiconductor devices may include semiconductor elements mounted on a lead and covered with a sealing resin. Such semiconductor devices are manufactured by mounting the semiconductor elements on the lead frame, covering the semiconductor elements with the sealing resin, and then cutting the lead frame and the sealing resin. Some manufacturing methods are designed so as to cut the semiconductor device halfway through a half-cut process, instead of cutting the semiconductor device into individual pieces at a time, perform predetermined processing on the semiconductor device, and then fully cut the semiconductor device into individual pieces. For example, JP-A-2014-183142 discloses a manufacturing method including forming a conductive layer in grooves formed through the half-cut process, and thereafter separating the semiconductor device into individual pieces through the full-cut process. In addition, JP-A-2007-123327 discloses a manufacturing method including cutting leads through the half-cut process, deburring the cut sections, and then separating the semiconductor device into individual pieces through the full-cut process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">According to these manufacturing methods, the half-cut process and the full-cut process are performed utilizing an alignment mark formed on the lead frame as reference. Here, a predetermined tolerance is specified with respect to the cutting position. When the cutting position of the half-cut process is shifted by a maximum tolerance, and the cutting position of the full-cut process is shifted by the maximum tolerance to the opposite side, a positional shift that exceeds the tolerance may be incurred between the cutting position of the half-cut process and the cutting position of the full-cut process.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the foregoing situation, the present disclosure proposes a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, arranged so as to prevent a positional shift of a cutting position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device. The method may include: preparing a lead frame having an obverse face and a reverse face spaced apart from each other in a thickness direction; mounting a semiconductor element on the obverse face of the lead frame; forming a sealing resin covering the semiconductor element; forming a groove on the reverse face of the lead frame; and removing a portion of the lead frame and a portion of the sealing resin along a disposal region that is narrower than and overlaps with the groove as viewed in the thickness direction, where the removing is performed with respect to an entirety of the lead frame and the sealing resin in the thickness direction. The preparing of the lead frame may include forming at least one recess in the lead frame, where the recess is located in the disposal region and has an end that is open in the thickness direction. The forming of the groove may include exposing the recess on a side of the reverse face of the lead frame. The removing may include cutting with reference to the recess.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent, through the detailed description given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>

The second terminal section end face <b>333</b> is formed by full-cut dicing in a first cutting process of the manufacturing process to be subsequently described. The second terminal section recess <b>334</b> is recessed from the second terminal section reverse face <b>332</b> toward the second terminal section obverse face <b>331</b>, and formed along the outer edge of the second terminal section reverse face <b>332</b> in the x-direction, so as to extend to both ends in the y-direction.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">On the surface of the third lead <b>3</b>, a plating layer <b>340</b> is provided over the mounting base reverse face <b>312</b>, the first terminal section reverse face <b>322</b>, the second terminal section reverse face <b>332</b>, and the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The plating layer <b>340</b> includes, for example, a Ni-plating layer, a Pd-plating layer, and a Au-plating layer superposed on each other. For example, the Ni-plating layer has a thickness of 0.5 μm to 2.0 μm, the Pd-plating layer has a thickness of 0.02 μm to 0.15 μm, and the Au-plating layer has a thickness of 0.003 μm to 0.015 μm. The structure of the plating layer <b>340</b> is not specifically limited and, for example, the Ni-plating layer and the Au-plating layer may be superposed on each other. As will be subsequently described, a plating layer is formed over the entire portion of the lead frame exposed from the sealing resin through the manufacturing process. However, since the first terminal section end face <b>323</b> and the second terminal section end face <b>333</b> correspond to the cut section formed through the first cutting process or the second cutting process, the plating layer <b>340</b> is not formed on these end faces.</div>

Accordingly, when the semiconductor device A<b>1</b> is mounted on a circuit board, a solder fillet is formed on the portion of the plating layer <b>340</b> corresponding to the second terminal section recess <b>334</b>. Therefore, the mounting strength of the semiconductor device A<b>1</b> onto the circuit board can be enhanced.

The bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>is oriented to the same side as the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>. The side face <b>904</b> <i>b </i>is connected to the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b> (and also a face of the sealing resin <b>920</b> oriented to the same side as the reverse face <b>902</b>), and the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a</i>. The groove <b>904</b> formed in the region of the lead frame <b>900</b> to be formed into the second terminal section <b>130</b> of the first lead <b>1</b> becomes the second terminal section recess <b>134</b>, the groove <b>904</b> formed in the region to be formed into the second terminal section <b>230</b> of the second lead <b>2</b> becomes the second terminal section recess <b>234</b>, and the groove <b>904</b> formed in the region to be formed into the second terminal section <b>330</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> becomes the second terminal section recess <b>334</b>. Further, a part of the groove <b>904</b> formed in the sealing resin <b>920</b> becomes the resin recess <b>85</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the groove forming process according to this embodiment includes the half-cut dicing process that uses a first blade <b>951</b> to remove (cut away) a part of the lead frame <b>900</b> from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. The thickness (size in the x-direction) of the first blade <b>951</b> is determined according to the size of the groove forming region S<b>3</b> in the x-direction. In this half-cut dicing process, the portion corresponding to the groove forming region S<b>3</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is cut from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to alignment marks formed at predetermined positions on the lead frame <b>900</b> (e.g., four corners of the lead frame <b>900</b>). In the half-cut dicing process, in addition, the cutting is performed to a position halfway of the lead frame <b>900</b> in the z-direction, and until reaching and exposing the recess <b>903</b> (until reaching the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>, as indicated by dash-dot-dot lines representing the first blade <b>951</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In this embodiment, the cutting is performed to a depth exceeding half a thickness (size in the z-direction) of the lead frame <b>900</b>, for example approximately two thirds of the thickness of the lead frame <b>900</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b> is connected to the recess <b>903</b>, so that the recess <b>903</b> is exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a</i>.

Since the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed of a black epoxy resin in this embodiment, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>appears in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>, as a mark easy to be visually recognized.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Proceeding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a plating layer <b>910</b> is formed (plating process). The plating layer <b>910</b> can be formed by electrolytic plating using the lead frame <b>900</b> as the conductive path.

In this embodiment, the plating layer <b>910</b> is formed by stacking a Ni-plating layer, a Pd-plating layer, and a Au-plating layer in this order. The plating layer <b>910</b> formed on the region of the lead frame <b>900</b> to be formed into the first lead <b>1</b> becomes the plating layer <b>140</b>, the plating layer <b>910</b> formed in the region to be formed into the second lead <b>2</b> becomes the plating layer <b>240</b>, and the plating layer <b>910</b> formed in the region to be formed into the third lead <b>3</b> becomes the plating layer <b>340</b>.</div>

The protective tape <b>970</b> is for preventing the individual pieces, produced after the first cutting process and the second cutting process to be subsequently described, from coming apart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Proceeding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> are cut along the y-direction, so as not to divide the protective tape <b>970</b> (first cutting process). In this embodiment, the first cutting process includes, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a full-cut dicing process that uses a second blade <b>952</b> to cut the lead frame <b>900</b> from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. The thickness (size in the x-direction) of the second blade <b>952</b> is determined according to the size of the first disposal region S<b>1</b> in the x-direction, and is thinner than the first blade <b>951</b>. The full-cut dicing includes cutting the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> at the position corresponding to the first disposal region S<b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b> until reaching the protective tape <b>970</b>, with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b> (recess <b>903</b> exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a</i>). Accordingly, the respective portions of the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b>, overlapping with the first disposal region S<b>1</b> as viewed in the z-direction, are entirely removed along the z-direction. Thus, cut sections each oriented in the x-direction are formed on the lead frame <b>900</b>. Out of these cut sections, the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the second terminal section <b>130</b> of the first lead <b>1</b> becomes the second terminal section end face <b>133</b>, the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the second terminal section <b>230</b> of the second lead <b>2</b> becomes the second terminal section end face <b>233</b>, and the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the second terminal section <b>330</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> becomes the second terminal section end face <b>333</b>.

Here, other methods than the full-cut dicing with the blade may be adopted, in the first cutting process. For example, a plasma dicing or laser dicing process may be performed, in the first cutting process. Through the first cutting process, the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> are divided in the x-direction.</div>

In this embodiment, the second cutting process includes the full-cut dicing process that uses the second blade <b>952</b> to cut the lead frame <b>900</b> from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. In this full-cut dicing process, the portion corresponding to the second disposal region S<b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> (same as the second disposal region S<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is cut from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to the alignment marks formed at the predetermined positions on the lead frame <b>900</b>. Accordingly, the respective portions of the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b>, overlapping with the second disposal region S<b>2</b> as viewed in the z-direction, are entirely removed along the z-direction. Thus, cut sections each oriented in the y-direction are formed on the lead frame <b>900</b>. Out of these cut sections, the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the first terminal section <b>120</b> of the first lead <b>1</b> becomes the first terminal section end face <b>123</b>, the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the first terminal section <b>220</b> of the second lead <b>2</b> becomes the first terminal section end face <b>223</b>, and the cut section formed at the position corresponding to the first terminal section <b>320</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> becomes the first terminal section end face <b>323</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Then the protective tape <b>970</b> is separated from the sealing resin <b>920</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The mentioned manufacturing method of the semiconductor device A<b>1</b> provides the following advantageous effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In the first cutting process according to this embodiment, the full-cut dicing process is performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>corresponds to the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>, filled in the recess <b>903</b> located at the center of the first disposal region S<b>1</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b> in the x-direction, and exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>. Accordingly, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>indicates the central position of the first disposal region S<b>1</b> in the x-direction. Since the cutting is performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>in the first cutting process, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of utilizing the alignment mark as reference, and an error in the cutting position can be minimized. Therefore, the total of an error corresponding to a maximum tolerance in the groove forming process and an error corresponding to the maximum tolerance in the opposite direction in the first cutting process becomes smaller, compared with the case where the alignment mark is employed as the reference in the first cutting process. Consequently, a positional shift of the cutting position with respect to the groove <b>904</b> can be minimized and, for example, the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> can be prevented from becoming excessively small beyond a permissible extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">According to this embodiment, the recess <b>903</b> has the open end on the side of the obverse face <b>901</b>, and the resin material is filled in the recess <b>903</b> in the resin forming process, so that the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed. Such an arrangement allows the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>to be exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>, through the half-cut dicing in the groove forming process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">According to this embodiment, the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed of a black epoxy resin. Therefore, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b> is easy to be visually recognized, for example by image recognition. In other words, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>can be suitably utilized as the reference, in the first cutting process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a first variation of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device A<b>1</b> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In this variation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the recess <b>903</b> is formed all the way through the lead frame <b>900</b>, from the obverse face <b>901</b> to the reverse face <b>902</b>. In other words, the recess <b>903</b> has the open end on the side of both the obverse face <b>901</b> and the reverse face <b>902</b>, thus becoming a hole <b>903</b>. In this variation the hole <b>903</b> is, for example, formed through an etching process, but a different method may be adopted to form the hole <b>903</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the resin material is filled in the hole <b>903</b>, so that the filled portion <b>921</b> is formed in each of the recesses <b>903</b>, in the resin forming process. Since the hole <b>903</b> extends as far as the reverse face <b>902</b>, the filled portion <b>921</b> is exposed from the reverse face <b>902</b>. Since the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed of a black epoxy resin in this variation, the filled portion <b>921</b> appears on the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>, as a mark easy to be visually recognized. In the groove forming process, the half-cut dicing process is performed from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to the filled portion <b>921</b> exposed from the reverse face <b>902</b>. In this half-cut dicing process, the cutting is performed to a position halfway of the lead frame <b>900</b> in the z-direction (see first blade <b>951</b> indicated by dash-dot-dot lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Since the filled portion <b>921</b> is exposed from the reverse face <b>902</b> from the beginning, the cutting depth in the half-cut dicing process is not specifically limited, unless the cutting is performed so as to reach the obverse face <b>901</b>. Through the groove forming process the groove <b>904</b> is formed, and the hole <b>903</b> is exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>. In addition, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>, and exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">This variation also provides the same advantageous effects as those provided by the first embodiment. In the groove forming process according to this variation, the groove <b>904</b> is formed through the half-cut dicing process, performed with reference to the filled portion <b>921</b> exposed from the reverse face <b>902</b>. Accordingly, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of forming the groove <b>904</b> with reference to the alignment mark, and an error in the forming position of the groove <b>904</b> can be minimized. Therefore, the total of an error corresponding to a maximum tolerance in the groove forming process and an error corresponding to the maximum tolerance in the opposite direction in the first cutting process becomes smaller, compared with the case where the alignment mark is employed as the reference in the groove forming process. Consequently, a positional shift of the cutting position with respect to the groove <b>904</b> can be further minimized and, for example, the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> can be prevented from becoming excessively small beyond a permissible extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a second variation of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device A<b>1</b> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In this variation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the recess <b>903</b> is recessed from the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>, toward the obverse face <b>901</b>. Thus, the recess <b>903</b> has the open end on the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. In this variation, the recess <b>903</b> is formed by half etching performed from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. In the illustrated example, the depth (size in the z-direction) of the recess <b>903</b> is half a thickness (size in the z-direction) of the lead frame <b>900</b>. The recess <b>903</b> may be formed, for example, by stamping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the resin material is not filled in the recess <b>903</b> in the resin forming process, and therefore the sealing resin <b>920</b> does not include the filled portion <b>921</b> formed as above. In the groove forming process, the half-cut dicing is performed from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to the recess <b>903</b> formed on the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. In this half-cut dicing process, the cutting is performed to a position shallower than the depth of the recess <b>903</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>, in the z-direction (see first blade <b>951</b> indicated by dash-dot-dot lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). In this embodiment, the cutting is performed to a depth equal to or shallower than the thickness (size in the z-direction) of the lead frame <b>900</b>. Accordingly, the groove <b>904</b> becomes shallower than the recess <b>903</b>, in the z-direction. Consequently, a part of the recess <b>903</b> remains, thus to be exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>. In the first cutting process, the full-cut dicing is performed from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to the recess <b>903</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">According to this variation, in the first cutting process the full-cut dicing is performed with reference to the recess <b>903</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>. Therefore, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of utilizing the alignment mark as reference, and an error in the cutting position can be minimized. According to this variation, further, in the groove forming process the half-cut dicing is performed with reference to the recess <b>903</b> formed on the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, to form the groove <b>904</b>. Accordingly, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of forming the groove <b>904</b> with reference to the alignment mark, and an error in the forming position of the groove <b>904</b> can be minimized. Therefore, the total of an error corresponding to a maximum tolerance in the groove forming process and an error corresponding to the maximum tolerance in the opposite direction in the first cutting process becomes smaller, compared with the case where the alignment mark is employed as the reference in the groove forming process and the first cutting process. Consequently, a positional shift of the cutting position with respect to the groove <b>904</b> can be minimized and, for example, the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> can be prevented from becoming excessively small beyond a permissible extent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In this embodiment, the location of the plurality of recesses <b>903</b> formed on the lead frame <b>900</b> are different from that of the first embodiment. The plurality of recesses <b>903</b> are each located along the first disposal region S<b>1</b> or the second disposal region S<b>2</b>. The recesses <b>903</b> located along the first disposal region S<b>1</b> are positioned at the center thereof in the x-direction. The recesses <b>903</b> located along the second disposal region S<b>2</b> are positioned at the center thereof in the y-direction. The recesses <b>903</b> are located in the region other than the intersection between the first disposal region S<b>1</b> and the second disposal region S<b>2</b>. The position and the number of the recesses <b>903</b> are not specifically limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Then the semiconductor element <b>6</b> is mounted on the lead frame <b>900</b> (mounting process), the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed (resin forming process), and the grooves <b>904</b> are formed (groove forming process). These processes are similar to those of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Proceeding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, grooves <b>905</b> are formed (second groove forming process). The grooves <b>905</b> are each recessed from the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b> toward the obverse face <b>901</b>, and formed along the position corresponding to the second groove forming region S<b>4</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, so as to extend in the x-direction. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the grooves <b>905</b> are formed so as to stride over the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b>. The grooves <b>905</b> each include a bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>and a side face <b>905</b> <i>b</i>. The bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>is oriented to the same side as the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>. The side face <b>905</b> <i>b </i>is connected to the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>, the face of the sealing resin <b>920</b> oriented to the same side as the reverse face <b>902</b>, and the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a</i>. The groove <b>905</b> formed in the region of the lead frame <b>900</b> to be formed into the first terminal section <b>120</b> of the first lead <b>1</b> becomes the first terminal section recess <b>124</b>, the groove <b>905</b> formed in the region to be formed into the first terminal section <b>220</b> of the second lead <b>2</b> becomes the first terminal section recess <b>224</b>, and the groove <b>905</b> formed in the region to be formed into the first terminal section <b>320</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> becomes the first terminal section recess <b>324</b>. In addition, a part of the groove <b>905</b> formed in the sealing resin <b>920</b> becomes the resin recess <b>86</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The second groove forming process includes, like the groove forming process, the half-cut dicing process that uses the first blade <b>951</b> to cut the reverse face <b>902</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b>. In this half-cut dicing process, the portion corresponding to the groove forming region S<b>4</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is cut from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>, with reference to the alignment marks formed at predetermined positions on the lead frame <b>900</b>. In the half-cut dicing process, in addition, the cutting is performed to a position halfway of the lead frame <b>900</b> in the z-direction, and until reaching and exposing the recess <b>903</b> (until reaching the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>). In this embodiment, the cutting is performed to a depth equal to or deeper than half a thickness (size in the z-direction) of the lead frame <b>900</b>, for example approximately two thirds of the thickness of the lead frame <b>900</b>. Accordingly, the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b> is connected to the recess <b>903</b>, so that the recess <b>903</b> is exposed from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a</i>. Further, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>, and exposed from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>. Since the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed of a black epoxy resin in this embodiment, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>appears in the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>, as a mark easy to be visually recognized. Here, in the second groove forming process, other methods than the half-cut dicing with the blade may be adopted, to form the groove <b>905</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Then the plating layer <b>910</b> is formed (plating process), the protective tape <b>970</b> is stuck, and the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> are cut along the y-direction (first cutting process). These processes are similar to those of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Then the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> are cut along the x-direction, so as not to cut the protective tape <b>970</b> (second cutting process). In this embodiment also, the second cutting process includes the full-cut dicing process that uses the second blade <b>952</b> to cut the lead frame <b>900</b> from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b>. This full-cut dicing includes cutting the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> at the position corresponding to the second disposal region S<b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, from the side of the reverse face <b>902</b> until reaching the protective tape <b>970</b>, with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b> (recess <b>903</b> exposed from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a</i>). Accordingly, the respective portions of the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b>, overlapping with the second disposal region S<b>2</b> as viewed in the z-direction, are entirely removed along the z-direction. Thus, cut sections each oriented in the y-direction are formed on the lead frame <b>900</b>. Through the second cutting process, the lead frame <b>900</b> and the sealing resin <b>920</b> are divided in the y-direction, and a plurality of individual pieces each having the semiconductor element <b>6</b> are connected via the protective tape <b>970</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Then the protective tape <b>970</b> is separated. At this point, the plurality of individual pieces each having the semiconductor element <b>6</b> are divided into independent pieces. Through the foregoing process, the semiconductor device A<b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">In this embodiment also, the full-cut dicing process is performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>. Accordingly, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of utilizing the alignment mark as reference, and an error in the cutting position can be minimized. Therefore, the total of an error corresponding to a maximum tolerance in the groove forming process and an error corresponding to the maximum tolerance in the opposite direction in the first cutting process becomes smaller, compared with the case where the alignment mark is employed as the reference in the first cutting process. Consequently, a positional shift of the cutting position with respect to the groove <b>904</b> can be minimized and, for example, the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> can be prevented from becoming excessively small beyond a permissible extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">According to this embodiment, the second cutting process includes the full-cut dicing process performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> exposed in the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>. The end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>corresponds to the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b>, filled in the recess <b>903</b> located at the center of the second disposal region S<b>2</b> of the lead frame <b>900</b> in the y-direction, and exposed from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>. Accordingly, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>indicates the central position of the second disposal region S<b>2</b> in the y-direction. Since the cutting is performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>in the second cutting process, higher accuracy can be attained compared with the case of utilizing the alignment mark as reference, and an error in the cutting position can be minimized. Therefore, the total of an error corresponding to a maximum tolerance in the second groove forming process and an error corresponding to the maximum tolerance in the opposite direction in the second cutting process becomes smaller, compared with the case where the alignment mark is employed as the reference in the second cutting process. Consequently, a positional shift of the cutting position with respect to the groove <b>905</b> can be minimized and, for example, the second terminal section recess <b>334</b> of the third lead <b>3</b> can be prevented from becoming excessively small beyond a permissible extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In this embodiment also, the recess <b>903</b> has the open end on the side of the obverse face <b>901</b>. Therefore, the resin material is also filled in the recess <b>903</b> in the resin forming process, so that the filled portion <b>921</b> of the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed. Such an arrangement allows the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>to be exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>, through the half-cut dicing in the groove forming process. Further, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>can be exposed from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>, by the half-cut dicing in the second groove forming process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In this embodiment also, the sealing resin <b>920</b> is formed of a black epoxy resin. Therefore, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>exposed from the bottom face <b>904</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>904</b>, and from the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b>, is easy to be visually recognized, for example by image recognition. In other words, the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>can be suitably utilized as the reference, in the first cutting process and the second cutting process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">According to this embodiment, the recesses <b>903</b> are each located in the region other than the intersection between the first disposal region S<b>1</b> and the second disposal region S<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the recess <b>903</b> remains in the second disposal region S<b>2</b>, despite the first disposal region S<b>1</b> having been removed in the first cutting process. In the second cutting process, therefore, the cutting can be performed with reference to the end face <b>921</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing resin <b>920</b> remaining in the bottom face <b>905</b> <i>a </i>of the groove <b>905</b> (recess <b>903</b> remaining in the second disposal region S<b>2</b>). Here, in the case where any of the recesses <b>903</b> remains even after the first disposal region S<b>1</b> is removed in the first cutting process, the positions of the other recesses <b>903</b> are not specifically limited.</div>
