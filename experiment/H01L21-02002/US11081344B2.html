<heading id="h-0009">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">First, the background of the method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described. As the diameters of semiconductor substrates have increased and semiconductor substrates have been thinned, warpage of semiconductor substrates in manufacturing steps (such as conveyance and exposure) has become a problem. Also, although various kinds of semiconductor elements may be manufactured on semiconductor substrates, especially, in the case where semiconductor elements are light emitting elements such as VCSELs (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers), thick epitaxial layers (for example, about more than 10 μm) becomes a problem in particular. Therefore, in the manufacturing steps, a method of straightening warpage is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the related art, a method of forming a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) film on the surface layer of a semiconductor substrate compressively stressed by an epitaxial layer in order to generate tensile stress, thereby straightening warpage, is known. However, in this method, for the CVD film formed the surface layer, restrictions are imposed on subsequent steps such as element formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">For this reason, in the present exemplary embodiment, before elements are formed on an epitaxial layer (before various films, electrodes, wiring lines, etc. are formed), a fracture layer is formed on the rear surface of a semiconductor substrate, for example, by grinding. Therefore, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate such that warpage of the substrate is suppressed as compared to the case where any fracture layer is not formed is provided. Herein, the term “fracture layer” means a layer having fine cracks or crystal lattice disturbance due to damage caused by grinding or the like. By the way, it is general to finally thin a semiconductor substrate having semiconductor elements formed thereon, and grinding is not performed before semiconductor elements are formed. The reason is that grinding may generate fine fragments (dust) of a semiconductor substrate to contaminate the surface having an epitaxial layer formed thereon, or may reduce the strength of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, steps of the method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described. In the present exemplary embodiment, the case where semiconductor elements which are manufactured using a semiconductor substrate are VCSELs will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">First, a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> whose front surface <b>50</b> has an epitaxial layer <b>12</b> formed thereon is prepared (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In other words, in the present exemplary embodiment, the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> where the epitaxial layer is formed is referred to as the “front surface”, and the surface facing the front surface is referred to as the rear surface. In individual views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a view marked with &lt;1&gt; shows a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, and a view marked with &lt;2&gt; shows a bottom view of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The epitaxial layer is a layer formed by epitaxial growth, and epitaxial growth is one of thin film crystal growth technologies, and is a growth method of performing crystal growth on a crystal to be a substrate such that crystals are arranged together on the crystal surface of the base substrate. The epitaxial layer <b>12</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment includes a lower reflector, an active layer, an upper reflector, and so on which constitute VCSELs. In some cases, a rear surface <b>52</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is mirror-finished to prevent falling off of fine fragments and so on from occurring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In this case, in the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, warpage may be caused by the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>. Details of warpage will be described below. By the way, the semiconductor substrate according to the present exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited to GaAs (gallium arsenide) substrates, InP (indium phosphide) substrates, Si (silicon) substrates, etc., and in the present exemplary embodiment, a GaAs substrate will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, a fracture layer <b>14</b> is formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In the present exemplary embodiment, warpage attributable to the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is straightened (the amount of warpage is alleviated) by the fracture layer <b>14</b>. Although formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b> may be performed, for example, by grinding (so-called back grinding) or polishing, in the present exemplary embodiment, it is performed by grinding in order to increase the degree of fracture. Grinding is performed, for example, with a grinding wheel, and in the present exemplary embodiment, grinding is performed with a grinding wheel having an abrasive-grain diameter selected such that straightening of warpage attributable to the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is properly carried out. Details of selection of an abrasive-grain diameter will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, on the fracture layer <b>14</b>, a protective film <b>16</b> is formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Although the protective film <b>16</b> may be formed of a metal film, a resist film, etc., in the present exemplary embodiment, it is formed of Au (gold). In the case of forming the protective film <b>16</b> of gold, a Ti (titanium) film may be interposed between the protective film and a base layer (an adhesion layer). In the case of forming the protective film <b>16</b> of a metal, the protective film endures even though it is subjected to a thermal process or an oxidation process in a subsequent step. Therefore, the fracture layer <b>14</b> is protected. Further, in particular, in the case of forming the protective film of Au, since Au is non-oxidizing, and is stable against chemicals and gases which are used in the step, it is suitable particularly for the case where subsequent steps include processes using them. Meanwhile, in the case of forming the protective film <b>16</b> of a resist film, the protective film may be formed more easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">A purpose of forming the protective film <b>16</b> is to prevent fine fragments of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> from falling off from the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> having the fracture layer <b>14</b> formed thereon and contaminating the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and so on as a foreign matter (particles). Also, it may be considered that if the manufacturing steps include a step for etching the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, the fracture layer <b>14</b> is cut and removed, whereby the warpage straightening effect changes, and the amount of warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> changes, and it becomes difficult to manage the amount of warpage (variation increases). For this reason, the protective film <b>16</b> is for preventing the fracture layer <b>14</b> from being removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the fracture layer <b>14</b> which is positioned at the peripheral part of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and on which the protective film <b>16</b> has not been formed (hereinafter, referred to as the uncovered fracture layer) is removed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The reason why the uncovered fracture layer remains is that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, when the protective film <b>16</b> is formed, especially, when the protective film <b>16</b> is formed of a metal film, support jigs for fixing the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> are brought into contact with a part corresponding to the uncovered fracture layer. The fracture layer <b>14</b> and the protective film <b>16</b> are removed in a predetermined subsequent step, for example, by grinding. Removal of the uncovered fracture layer is performed by light etching using, for example, wet etching. Removal of the uncovered fracture layer is performed to prevent fine fragments from falling off from the corresponding part. In other words, in the case where falling off of fine fragments does not become a problem, it is not necessarily needed to remove the uncovered fracture layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Thereafter, general steps for manufacturing VCSELs, i.e. a step for forming VCSEL elements, a step for measuring characteristics (intermediate characteristics) of the VCSEL elements which is performed if necessary, a step for removing the fracture layer <b>14</b> and the protective film <b>16</b>, a step for thinning the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> by grinding the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, a step for forming an electrode on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, a step for testing the VCSEL elements, a step for individualizing the VCSEL elements, etc. are performed. Here, in the case where the protective film <b>16</b> has been formed of a metal, in the step for measuring the intermediate characteristics (for example, for quality determination), the protective film <b>16</b> is used as a rear electrode (provisional metal). Also, in order to form ohmic contact between the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> using GaAs and the rear electrode, it is preferable to use Au as the protective film <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a view illustrating warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> which is caused by stress of the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a view illustrating warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> when stress attributable to the fracture layer <b>14</b> has been applied; and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a view illustrating reverse warpage of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, if the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, stress (compressive stress) Se occurs such that the whole of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is curved in such a convex shape that the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> becomes the convex side. This is warpage attributable to the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">If a fracture layer <b>14</b>A is subsequently formed on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> in which warpage has been caused by the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>, stress (compressive stress) Sb<b>1</b> occurs. Since the stress Se and the stress Sb<b>1</b> are formed on the surfaces facing each other and both are stress in the compressing direction, they are cancelled by each other, whereby the warpage attributable to the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is straightened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, occurrence of the stress Sb<b>1</b> will be described in detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a view for conceptually explaining occurrence of the stress Sb<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, if the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is ground (if the fracture layer <b>14</b> is formed), stress Sb which is compressive stress occurs over the entire semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. By this stress Sb, the entire semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is warped such that the ground surface becomes the convex side. This compressive stress attributable to grinding is caused by occurrence of grinding damage <b>18</b> (cracks) on the ground surface side as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The degree of grinding damage <b>18</b> is indirectly measured, for example, on the basis of roughness of the front surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (such as a maximum height Rmax).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a view illustrating “reverse warpage” of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, the term “reverse warpage” means such warpage that the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> becomes the concave side. In the case where the degree of formation of a fracture layer <b>14</b>B is large and stress Sb<b>2</b> which is compressive stress is large, such reverse warpage may occur. In the case of setting an amount of warpage attributable to the fracture layer <b>14</b> in view of subsequent steps, an amount of warpage may be set such that such reverse warpage occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, in forming the fracture layer <b>14</b> for straightening warpage attributable to the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>, it is preferable that the degree of stress Sb which is compressive stress should be finely adjustable. For this reason, in the present exemplary embodiment, for grinding for forming the fracture layer <b>14</b>, changing between grinding-wheel abrasive-grain diameters (grinding-wheel numbers) is performed according to amounts of straightening of warpage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the relation between the grinding-wheel abrasive-grain diameters and amounts of warpage. The horizontal axis represents the abrasive-grain diameters and the abrasive-grain diameters decrease. In this case, the grinding-wheel numbers increase. Also, on the vertical axis, the magnitudes of amounts of warpage which occur when semiconductor substrates having the same diameter are ground by the same amount (for example, 50 μm) with grinding wheels having the individual abrasive-grain diameters are shown. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, as the abrasive-grain diameters decrease, the amounts of warpage which occur decrease. Meanwhile, as the abrasive-grain diameters decrease, straightening of a minuter amount of warpage is performed, but the grinding time becomes longer. Like this, the degree of straightening of warpage is adjusted according to abrasive-grain diameter selection, and if necessary, it is possible to reversely warp the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Now, other parameters which influence setting of an amount of warpage during formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b> (abrasive-grain diameter selection) will be described. As described above, warpage is caused by the epitaxial layer <b>12</b>. The amount of warpage at that time increases as the thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> increases. Also, as the diameter of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> on which the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is formed increases, and as the thickness of the semiconductor substrate decreases, the amount of warpage increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, after the protective film <b>16</b> is formed, the process proceeds, and by forming of the VCSEL elements by etching or the like, and so on, the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is divided. At this time, some parts of the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> are removed. If some parts of the epitaxial layer <b>12</b> are removed, since the compressive stress which causes warpage decreases (the semiconductor substrate is reversely straightened), the amount of warpage decreases. Meanwhile, the thickness of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> having the VCSEL elements formed thereon which is, for example, 600 μm to 650 μm at the beginning decreases to, for example, 500 μm in the middle of the process, and finally decreases to, for example, about 150 μm. This thinning acts in such a direction that the amount of warpage increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In other words, if occurrence of reverse straightening or warpage in a subsequent step is taken into account, when the fracture layer <b>14</b> for straightening warpage is formed, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> does not necessarily need to be straightened until the semiconductor substrate becomes flat (the amount of warpage less than 10 μm). Here, for example, warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may cause an absorption error in the conveying step, resulting in a conveyance failure. Also, in an exposing step using a stepper (an exposure device), the focus may not be set in the plane of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, resulting in a focusing failure. However, with respect to these failures which may be considered in the subsequent steps, there is an acceptable warpage amount. Therefore, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> does not necessarily need to be flat. In other words, the warpage may be intentionally left after formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b>, and the amount of warpage to be left may be set to an amount of warpage (a target warpage amount) which is acceptable throughout all of the subsequent steps, in view of occurrence of reverse straightening or warpage in the subsequent steps. In other words, after formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b>, warpage may be left such that in the subsequent steps which are performed after formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b>, the warpage does not get worse than the amount of warpage after the formation of the fracture layer <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Here, since the amount of warpage which is acceptable in each step depends on the kind of a manufacturing apparatus, etc., it difficult to uniformly specify a target warpage amount. However, in general, if the amount of warpage becomes about one hundred and several tens μm, it becomes a problem in the process. Therefore, it is necessary to straighten the warpage, for example, to about several tens μm.</div>
