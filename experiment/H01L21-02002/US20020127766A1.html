In this process, a crystal pulling apparatus purged with a continuous stream of argon is utilized wherein polycrystalline silicon (“polysilicon”) is charged to a quartz crucible with or without dopant, the polysilicon is melted, a seed crystal is immersed into the molten silicon and a single crystal silicon ingot is grown by slow extraction while the crucible is rotated. <span style="display: none">[0003] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">Once a single silicon ingot is grown and shaped, it is generally sliced into individual wafers and refined by etching and/or lapping and grinding to increase the wafer flatness. Generally, the substrate edges are rounded and the wafer chemically etched to reduce any surface damage and contamination caused by prior processing steps. Finally, the wafers are polished on one or both sides and an epitaxial silicon layer deposited on the front surface of the wafer to provide a semiconductor wafer suitable for device fabrication. At various points in the manufacturing process the wafer can be treated such that its gettering capabilities are increased. <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> </div>

During fast cooling of fast pull or continuous pull single silicon crystals (i.e., crystals grown under vacancy rich conditions) agglomeration of vacancies results in the formation of small voids on the crystal that are exposed during the subsequent wafering processes and ultimately detected on semiconductor wafers as crystal originated pits/particles (COPs), surface defects, dislocations, and oxidation-induced stacking faults (OSF). These defects can severely degrade the performance of circuits fabricated on the wafer, and can make the wafer unfit for grade 1 product. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>

Although this method does substantially eliminate many of the above-described defects, it is a slow and costly process. Another approach disclosed by Adachi (U.S. Pat. No. 5,931,662) utilizes various high temperature annealing steps in different gas atmospheres to smooth the wafer surface and reduce the number of COPs on the wafer surface. <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>

Another approach in the art to reduce grown in defects such as COPs on the front surface of a semiconductor wafer is to grow an epitaxial silicon layer on the front surface of a polished semiconductor wafer. The deposition of a few microns of epitaxial silicon on the front surface of a polished semiconductor wafer causes the surface to restructure and typically eliminates substantially all of the COPs on the wafer surface. The use of silicon wafers having an epitaxial silicon layer to reduce or eliminate COPs and other grown in defects to date has been a costly option as the epitaxial layer is grown on a polished surface to ensure the control of potential nanotopology problems.

</li> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0017" num="0017">In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that low-cost, high quality semiconductors wafers having an epitaxial layer on the front surface can be produced in a simplified manufacturing process wherein the epitaxial silicon layer is grown directly onto an etched semiconductor surface followed by a final polish. Surprisingly, it has been shown that perturbations in the geometry of the epitaxial silicon layer due to the surface roughness of the etched surface which can interfere with patterning during device manufacturing are substantially eliminated by the final polishing. Advantageously, the semiconductor wafer of the present invention can also be subjected to a process for increasing the internal gettering capabilities of the wafer without adversely effecting the epitaxial layer. <span style="display: none">[0017] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0018" num="0018">Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a flow chart detailing the process steps of the present invention to produce low cost semiconductor wafers having an epitaxial layer on the front surface. As indicated in FIG. 1, the semiconductor wafer is sliced from a single-crystal ingot which may or may not contain a p-type or n-type dopant utilizing a conventional internal diameter saw or wire saw to produce a thin wafer disk having a predetermined initial thickness. The wafer has a front surface and a back surface, and an imaginary central plane between the front and back surfaces. The terms “front” and “back” in this context are used to distinguish the two major, generally planar surfaces of the wafer. The front surface for purposes of this invention is the surface upon which the epitaxial layer is deposited and upon which electronic devices are ultimately printed. The initial thickness of each semiconductor wafer is substantially greater than the desired end thickness of the finished wafer to allow subsequent processing operations to reduce the thickness of the wafer without the risk of damaging or fracturing the wafer. For example, the initial thickness of the semiconductor wafer may be between about 800 and about 1200 microns. Semiconductor wafers suitable for use in the present invention include p(+), p(−), n(+) and n(−) semiconductor wafers. <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0019" num="0019">After slicing, the semiconductor wafer is generally subjected to a conventional cleaning operation to remove particulate matter deposited on the wafer during the slicing operation. This cleaning process may include sequential tanks of etching solution, cleaning solution and water rinses. Approximately 2 to 10 microns of material is removed from both the front and the back surfaces of the semiconductor wafer during cleaning. At this stage of the manufacturing process, the peripheral edge of the wafer may also be profiled by a conventional edge grinder to reduce the risk of damage to the wafer during further processing. The wafer is generally cleaned after profiling in a similar manner as described above. The wafer may then be optionally marked by laser for identification prior to the next operation. <span style="display: none">[0019] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0020" num="0020">Referring again to FIG. 1, the wafer is next subjected to a conventional lapping and/or grinding operation to lessen the waviness and surface damage on the wafer generated from ingot slicing. The lapping and/or grinding operation generally removes between about 40 microns and about 80 microns, preferably about 60 microns of material from the wafer. After the conventional lapping and/or grinding operation the wafer generally has a TTV of between about 0.5 microns and about 1.5 microns and a surface roughness (R<span style="display: none">[0020] </span> <sub>A</sub>) of between about 0.1 microns and about 0.5 microns over an area of 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that conventional lapping and/or grinding techniques are well known in the industry and various methods can be utilized to carry out the operation. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0021" num="0021">Again referring the FIG. 1, the wafer is next subjected to an etching operation in which the wafer is immersed in a chemical etchant to further reduce the thickness of the wafer and to further remove damage remaining on the semiconductor wafer surfaces. Conventional etching techniques such as acidic or alkaline immersion etching wherein the semiconductor wafer is completely immersed in an etchant solution for a short period of time generally on the order of about 1 minute to about 7 minutes are in accordance with the present invention. After the etching operation is complete, the semiconductor wafer generally has a TTV of between about 1 micron and about 4 microns, more preferably about 2.5 microns and an average front surface roughness (R<span style="display: none">[0021] </span> <sub>A</sub>) of between about 50 nanometers and about 100 nanometers over an area of 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter, preferably about 75 nanometers over an area of 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter. The conventional immersion etching techniques generally remove about 40 microns of material total from the semiconductor wafer, or about 20 microns from the front and about 20 microns from the back surface. It would be recognized by one skilled in the art that other etching techniques, such as plasma etching or micro-etching may also be used in accordance with the present invention. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0022" num="0022">After the etching operation is complete, the wafer is subjected to a two-step pre-epitaxial deposition cleaning operation. The first step is a wet cleaning operation to remove metals and particulates wherein both surfaces are cleaned using a conventional solution such as piranha mixtures (i.e., mixtures of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide), SC-1 mixtures, and SC-2 mixtures. The second step cleans the front surface of the semiconductor wafer and removes any native silicon oxide layer (i.e., a silicon oxide layer which forms on a silicon surface and generally has a thickness of from about 10 to about 15 angstroms) for epitaxial silicon deposition. Any silicon oxide layer preferably is completely removed from the front surface of the wafer before the epitaxial layer is deposited onto the surface. As used herein, the phrase “silicon oxide layer” refers to a layer of silicon atoms which are chemically bound to oxygen atoms. <span style="display: none">[0022] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0023" num="0023">In a preferred second step of the cleaning method in accordance with the present invention, cleaning of the front surface and removal of the silicon oxide layer is accomplished by heating the surface of the wafer in an oxidant-free atmosphere until the silicon oxide layer is removed from the surface. More particularly, the surface of the wafer is preferably heated to a temperature of at least about 1100° C., and more preferably to a temperature of at least about 1150° C. This heating preferably is conducted while exposing the surface of the wafer to an atmosphere comprising a noble gas (e.g., He, Ne, or Ar) or H<span style="display: none">[0023] </span> <sub>2</sub>. Most preferably, the atmosphere consists essentially of H<sub>2</sub>because use of other atmospheres may tend to cause etch pits to form in the surface of the wafer. Conventional pre-epitaxial deposition cleaning operations, which remove a silicon oxide layer by heating a wafer in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, include heating the wafer to a high temperature (e.g., from about 1000 to about 1250° C.) and then baking the wafer at that temperature for a period of time (e.g., typically up to about 90 seconds). During the removal of the silicon oxide layer, the wafer preferably is heated at a rate which does not introduce thermal gradients which may cause slip. </div>

In accordance with the present invention, the epitaxial deposition preferably is carried out by chemical vapor deposition in a batch operation. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the surface of the wafer is exposed to an atmosphere comprising a volatile gas comprising silicon (e.g., SiCl<span style="display: none">[0024] </span> <sub>4</sub>, SiHCl<sub>3</sub>, SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl, or SiH<sub>4</sub>) . The atmosphere also preferably contains a carrier gas (preferably H<sub>2</sub>) . In one embodiment, the source of silicon during the epitaxial deposition is SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>or SiH<sub>4</sub>. If SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>is used, the reactor pressure during deposition preferably is from about 500 to about 760 Torr. If, on the other hand, SiH<sub>4 </sub>is used, the reactor pressure preferably is about 100 Torr. Most preferably, the source of silicon during the deposition is SiHCl<sub>3</sub>. This tends to be much cheaper than other sources. In addition, an epitaxial deposition using SiHCl<sub>3 </sub>may be conducted at atmospheric pressure. This is advantageous because no vacuum pump is required and the reactor chamber does not have to be as robust to prevent collapse. Moreover, fewer safety hazards are presented and the chance of air leaking into the reactor chamber is lessened. </div>

As the temperature of the wafer is decreased through this range of temperatures, the vacancies diffuse to the oxide layer and become annihilated, thus leading to a change in the vacancy concentration profile with the extent of change depending upon the length of time the wafer is maintained at a temperature within this range. If the wafer were held at this temperature within this range for an infinite period of time, the vacancy concentration would once again become substantially uniform throughout the wafer bulk with the concentration being an equilibrium value which is substantially less than the concentration of crystal lattice vacancies immediately upon completion of the heat treatment step. By rapidly cooling the wafer, however, a non-uniform distribution of crystal lattice vacancies can be achieved with the maximum vacancy concentration being at or near central plane of the wafer and the vacancy concentration decreasing in the direction of the front surface and back surface of the wafer. In general, the average cooling rate within this range of temperatures is at least about 5° C. per second, preferably at least about 20° C. per second, more preferably at least about 50° C. per second, still more preferably at least about 100° C. per second, with cooling rates in the range of about 100° C. to about 200° C. per second being presently most preferred. Once the wafer is cooled to a temperature outside the range of temperatures at which crystal lattice vacancies are relatively mobile in the single crystal silicon, the cooling rate does not appear to significantly influence the precipitating characteristics of the wafer and thus, does not appear to be narrowly critical. <span style="display: none">[0040] </span> </div>
