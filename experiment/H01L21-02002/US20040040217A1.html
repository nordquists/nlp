More specifically, the present invention relates to a polishing composition useful in planarization of a semiconductor substrate having a thin film formed on its rugged surface, a polishing process comprising subjecting a semiconductor substrate to planarization with the polishing composition, a method for planarization of a semiconductor substrate with the polishing composition, and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising polishing a semiconductor substrate with the polishing composition. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">In an ultra large scale integrated circuit of the present day, there is a tendency that a transistor and other semiconductor elements are reduced in size, thereby increasing mounting density. Therefore, various microfibrication techniques have been developed. One of the microfabrication techniques includes chemical-mechanical polishing (also simply referred to as “CMP”) technique. The CMP technique is very important in the process for manufacturing a semiconductor device, for instance, shallow trench isolation (STI), planarization of interlayer dielectric, formation of embedded metal line, plug formation, formation of embedded capacitor, and the like. Among them, the planarization, which serves to reduce a step height of the polishing surface, which is carried out when various metals, dielectrics and the like are laminated, is an important step from the viewpoints of miniaturization and densification of a semiconductor device. Therefore, there has been desired to quickly realize planarization. <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005">One example of a polishing liquid for CMP usable in the above production steps includes a dispersion of abrasive particles in water. The abrasive particles include particles of fumed silica, alumina and the like. Among them, the fumed silica is widely used because of its low cost and high purity. However, there is a disadvantage in the fumed silica that scratches are likely to be generated on the surface because aggregated particles (secondary particles) are formed in the production process. On the other hand, since silica abrasive grains which are referred to as “colloidal silica” have relatively spherical surface shape, and are in a state of nearly monodisperse, aggregated particles are hardly likely to be formed, so that reduction in scratches can be expected and that the silica abrasive grains have begun to be used. However, there is a disadvantage in the silica abrasive grains that the polishing rate is generally low. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006">As to a polishing composition using the colloidal silica, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-323254 discloses a silica polishing liquid having a specified particle size distribution. However, the main feature of the polishing liquid is to reduce a surface roughness of a surface to be polished from 5 to 15 Å or so (0.5 to 1.5 nm or so) to 3 Å or less (0.3 nm or less). When the silica has the specified particle size distribution, it would take much time for planarization of a step height of the surface of a semiconductor substrate of 100 to 20000 Å (10 to 2000 nm). <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007">Also, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-30274 discloses that a polished surface having small average waviness (several Å or less) is obtained by using the polishing composition comprising a mixture of two kinds of colloidal silicas having different particle sizes. The problem of obtaining the polished surface having small average waviness (several Å or less) is, for instance, a problem for reducing an average waviness of a polished surface in which an average waviness of an initial surface to be polished caused in the final polishing process of a hard disk is several dozen Å or less), and an average waviness of the polished surface is several Å or less). Therefore, the polished surface having an average waviness of several Å or less concretely disclosed in the publication is concerned with a surface after final polishing of a hard disk, which is essentially different from a surface to be polished having step height subjected to planarization, for instance, a surface of a semiconductor substrate or the like. <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0008" num="0008">Further, U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,662 discloses a CMP method using a slurry comprising small size particles having an average particle size of 2 to 30 nm and large size particles having an average particle size of 2 to 10 times that of the small size particles, wherein the volume ratio of the small size particles to the large size particles is 5:1 to 100:1. However, there are some disadvantages that since the small size particles occupy the majority of 83% or more of the slurry, the polishing rate is low and the polishing time required up to completion of planarization becomes longer, so that it is unsatisfactory from the viewpoint of planarization efficiency. <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> </div>

Specifically, the thicknesses of the remaining film of line portion and space portion of the GRADUAL D90 patterns on the wafer were determined for every minute of polishing under the above-mentioned set conditions (the determination method was the same as above). The polishing was repeated until the amount of the step height became 0 (planarization being completed), which can be found from the initial difference which was already known, and the polishing time required was determined. The results are expressed by the polishing time required to complete the planarization, and those polishing compositions having a polishing time of 4 minutes or less are considered to be excellent in planarization (Table 2).
