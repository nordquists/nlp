<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002"> In a silicon wafer used in steps for producing semiconductor devices and so forth, an insulator film such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or a metal film for wiring such as Al, W, or Ti is generally deposited. For reclaiming such a silicon wafer as used in steps for producing devices and so forth, such a reclaiming method as immersing a silicon wafer in a chemical liquid such as a hydrofluoric acid or a sulfuric acid to dissolve and remove various types of thin films having deposited on the wafer, and then subjecting at least one side of front and back sides of the wafer to mirror-polishing has been conventionally used. However, in the case of reclaiming a silicon wafer by using such a method, there has been a risk that metal ions dissolved at a high concentration in the chemical liquid adhere to the wafer again during immersing the wafer and thereby re-contamination is caused. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> However, in recent years, for meeting the tendency to speeding up of devices, copper wire is put into practical use as a wiring material having low resistance, and as silicon wafers used in steps for producing devices and so forth, wafers to which copper films adhere have increased. However, copper cannot be removed with such chemicals having been used conventionally as described above, and in the case that a wafer to which copper adheres is subjected to reclaiming treatment, there is possibility that the treatment process in itself is contaminated with copper and thereby other products are also contaminated with copper. Therefore, it has been thought that it is difficult to reclaim a silicon wafer to which a copper film has adhered. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004"> Accordingly, for example, for solving the above problem and reclaiming a silicon wafer to which a copper film has adhered, a method for reclaiming a silicon single crystal wafer to which a copper film has adhered, at least, comprising a step of dissolving and removing a copper film with a sulfuric acid-hydrogen peroxide solution and a step of mirror-polishing the surface of the copper-film-removed wafer has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No. 2002-158207. It is possible to dissolve and remove a copper film easily and rapidly by using such a method and therefore it has become possible to reclaim a silicon wafer to which a copper film has adhered. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> On the other hand, copper, gold, and such have a very fast rate of diffusion in silicon. Therefore, it is known that in such a case as copper having adhered to silicon, copper diffuses inside silicon in a short time. However, in the case of reclaiming a silicon wafer in which copper, gold or the like has diffused inside the wafer as described above, it is possible to remove copper having adhered to the wafer surface and to clean the wafer by using the above-described reclaiming method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No. 2002-158207. However, in the case of copper (impurities) having diffused inside the wafer, it is impossible to remove it perfectly. Therefore, in such a case as leaving long hours the silicon wafer reclaimed by the method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No. 2002-158207, impurities having diffused inside the wafer occasionally segregate out to the surface. Therefore, there is a problem that if the reclaimed polished wafer is subsequently used in steps for producing semiconductor devices and so forth, such troubles as lowering yield are caused. </div>
