<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, the production process of semiconductor silicon wafer comprises a slicing step of slicing a single crystal ingot to obtain a wafer in the form of thin disc, a chamfering step of chamfering the periphery of the wafer obtained in the slicing step in order to prevent cracks and break of the wafer, a lapping step of planing the chamfered wafer, an etching step of removing process strain remaining in the chamfered and lapped wafer, a polishing step of mirror-polishing the etched wafer surface and a cleaning step of cleaning the polished wafer to remove abrasives or foreign materials adhered thereto.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the above-mentioned polishing step, generally polishing is carried out by using a polishing composition obtained by dispersing fine abrasive of silica in water and further adding chemical polishing accelerators such as inorganic alkali, ammonium salt, amine, or the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the alkaline silica-containing polishing composition contains trace amounts of metal impurities. The metal impurities contained in the polishing composition include nickel, chromium, iron, copper or the like. These metal impurities easily adhere to the silicon wafer surface in an alkaline solution. The adherent metal impurity, particularly copper has a high diffusion coefficient, and easily diffuses into the crystal of the silicon wafer. It becomes clear that the metal impurities diffused into the crystal cannot be removed by subsequent cleaning, thereby causing deterioration in qualities of the silicon wafer and lowering in characteristics of semiconductor device manufactured by using the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a countermeasure against metal contamination on semiconductor wafer resulting from the silica-containing polishing composition, a method by use of a highly purified polishing composition may be mentioned. An example is disclosed in which a semiconductor wafer is polished by using a silica sol containing each iron, chromium, nickel, aluminum and copper in a content less than 1 mass ppb (see, Patent Document 1). However, the high purified polishing composition is generally expensive and therefore cost for polishing presents a problem.</div>

In particular, as the polishing composition exerts an effect also for amines, copper contamination can be inhibited while maintaining a high removal rate. Further, as it is not required to increase the purity of the polishing composition, metal contamination can be inhibited in a low cost.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0024">The embodiments of the present invention will be described. In the present invention, silica (silicon dioxide) is used as an abrasive. Although it is known that ceria and alumina as abrasives for grinding or polishing silicon wafers are effective, silica is suitable as an abrasive for the polishing composition of the present invention. In addition, as silica, silica sol, fumed silica, precipitated silica or silica in other form is known, and any silica among them can be used in the present invention. In particular, in order to polish semiconductor surface in a high precision, it is preferable to use a silica sol (a stable dispersion of silica particles) containing particles having homogeneous particle diameter and an average particle diameter of colloidal dimension (nano dimension).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0033" num="0025">The silica sol used in the present invention may be any silica sol obtained according to any known production methods. The production method is not specifically limited. As the production method of silica sol, JP-B-46-20137 (1971) discloses a production method of concentrated aqueous silica sol comprising adding an aqueous colloidal solution of active silicic acid in an alkali silicate aqueous solution while evaporating off water at a temperature of 90° C. or more. JP-A-60-251119 (1985) discloses a production method of silica sol having large particle diameter comprising adding an aqueous colloidal solution of active silicic acid in an alkali silicate aqueous solution to prepare a silica sol in which silica particles of 40 to 120 nm are dispersed in a disperse medium, then maturing it after adding an acid, and further concentrating through a fine porous membrane. JP-B49-4636 (1974) discloses a production method of stable silica sol having arbitrary and desired particle diameter comprising heating an aqueous silica sol under a specific condition. In addition, JP-B-41-3369 (1966) discloses a production method of highly purified silica sol comprising subjecting an alkali silicate aqueous solution to de-alkalization process with acid type cation exchange resin to obtain a silicate sol, adding nitric acid in the sol to adjust pH 1.2, maturing at ordinary temperature for 72 hours, then passing through an acid type strong acid cation exchange resin and an hydroxy type anion exchange resin, immediately adding sodium hydroxide therein to adjust pH 8.0, and concentrating with evaporation under vacuum at 80° C. while maintaining a constant level of solution in a vessel. JP-A-63-285112 (1988) discloses a production method of silica sol having high purity and large particle diameter comprising subjecting an alkali silicate aqueous solution to de-alkalization process with acid type cation exchange resin to obtain a silicate sol, adding a strong acid in the sol to adjust pH 0 to 2, aging, then passing through an acid type strong acid cation exchange resin and an hydroxy type anion exchange resin, adding a highly purified alkali metal hydroxide aqueous solution therein to obtain a stabilized silica aqueous colloid having a high purity adjusted to pH 7 to 8, adding the stabilized silica aqueous colloid having a high purity to a heating stabilized silica aqueous colloid having a high purity at a temperature of 90 to 120° C. to a silica sol, maturing the silica sol after adding an acid therein, and further concentrating through a fine porous membrane. Further, JP-A-63-74911 (1988) discloses a production method of finely spherical silica comprising hydrolyzing an alkoxy silane in a water-alcohol mixed solution containing an alkaline catalyst. In the meanwhile, the average particle diameter of silica is an average particle diameter (D nm) calculated from a specific surface area (S m<sup>2</sup>/g) measured by nitrogen adsorption method (BET method) according to the formula of D=2720/S. The average particle diameter is generally 3 to 1000 nm, preferably 5 to 500 nm, most preferably 10 to 500 nm, which falls into colloidal dimension. Further, the mass proportion of the silica added is generally 0.05 to 30 mass %, preferably 0.1 to 10 mass %, more preferably 1 to 5 mass % based on the total mass of the polishing composition. In case where the proportion is 0.05 mass % or less, sufficient removal rate is not obtained.

As shown in Comparative Example 7, even when a silica sol containing copper in a small amount was used, copper contamination in silicon wafer was not able to be fully inhibited.

In particular, as the polishing composition exerts an effect also for amines, copper contamination can be inhibited while maintaining a high removal rate. Further, as the polishing composition of the present invention is not required to purify a polishing composition to a high purity, it can inhibit metal contamination in a low cost.</div>
