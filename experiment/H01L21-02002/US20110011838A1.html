<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA82676153">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention discloses a method for fabricating semiconductor wafers applicable to IC manufacture, which comprises steps: providing an ingot; slicing the ingot into a plurality of wafers; using a laser to illuminate the surface of the wafers to eliminate the saw marks generated by slicing and fuse the microcracks on the surface of the wafers; pickling, polishing and inspecting the wafers. The present invention uses intensive laser energy to remove saw marks generated by slicing and fuse microcracks generated by stress. Thereby, the effect of isotropic etching is reduced in the succeeding pickling procedures, and the damage layer is minimized. Thus, the thickness of the removed material is reduced, and a single ingot can be sliced into more wafers.</div>

Refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a flowchart of the conventional process for fabricating semiconductor wafers applicable to IC manufacture. In Step S<b>1</b>, a silicon ingot is provided. In step S<b>2</b>, the silicon ingot is sliced to form wafers. At this time, the wafers have saw marks thereon. The saw marks have a maximum height difference measuring about 14-16 μm from a single side of a wafer, or about 30-45 μm from both sides of a wafer. In Step S<b>3</b>, the wafers are pickled to eliminate stress and surface impurities, deepen cracks, and soften material structures to facilitate the succeeding grinding procedures. In Step S<b>4</b>, lapping and/or grinding are undertaken. Then, the wafers are processed with Step S<b>5</b> of cleaning, Step S<b>6</b> of polishing, Step S<b>7</b> of cleaning, Step S<b>8</b> of inspection, etc. to form silicon wafers applicable to IC manufacture. In the abovementioned process, as thick as 130-150 μm of material is removed from the surfaces of a wafer to eliminate saw marks and damage layers generated in pickling. Thus, most of the thickness of a wafer is expended in removing damage layers caused by the isotropic etching in pickling. Then, a greater thickness must be reserved for the succeeding grinding procedures in wafer slicing. Consequently, fewer wafers are obtained from a silicon ingot. Accordingly, the present invention proposes a method for fabricating semiconductor wafers applicable to IC manufacture to overcome the abovementioned problem.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The spirit of the present invention is to use intensive laser energy to remove saw marks on the surface of wafers and fuse microcracks generated by stress. Thereby, the effect of isotropic etching is reduced in the succeeding pickling procedure, and the damage layer is minimized. Then, the lapping/grinding procedure can be omitted, and the thickness of the removed material is reduced. Thus, a single ingot can be sliced into more wafers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a flowchart of a method for fabricating semiconductor wafers applicable to IC manufacture according to the present invention. In Step S<b>11</b>, a silicon ingot (or a germanium ingot or a gallium arsenide ingot) is provided. Next, in Step S<b>12</b>, the silicon ingot is sliced into wafers. Next, in Step S<b>13</b>, a laser having a wavelength of 309-2140 nm is used to illuminate the entire surface of a wafer in a single-pass scanning mode or a multi-pass scanning mode to remove saw marks on the surface of the wafer and fuse microcracks on the surface of the wafer, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Next, in Step S<b>14</b>, the wafer is pickled to eliminate stress and surface impurities and soften the material structures to facilitate the succeeding grinding procedures. Next, in Step S<b>15</b>, the wafer is polished. Next, in Step S<b>16</b>, the wafer is washed to remove the polishing agent or polishing slurry. Next, in Step S<b>17</b>, the wafer is inspected. Then, the wafers applicable to IC manufacture are completed and delivered to the customers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">After the illumination of laser, the saw marks have a maximum height difference measuring about 1-2 μm from a single side of the wafer. Even measuring from both sides of the wafer, the maximum height difference of the saw marks is only about 2-4 μm. In comparison with the conventional technology having a maximum height difference measuring about 14-16 μm from a single side and a maximum height difference measuring about 30-45 μm from both sides, the present invention obviously decreases the height difference of saw marks and greatly improves the surface roughness of the wafer. Further, as the laser illumination also fuses the microcracks, the damage layer, which is caused by the isotropic etching in pickling, is minimized and less thick than in the conventional technology.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">As the total thickness of the material to be removed is only 10-20 μm, the lapping/grinding step may be omitted in the present invention. However, omitting the lapping/grinding step is neither the characteristic nor the focus of the present invention. Whether to omit the lapping/grinding step is still dependent on the requirement of the process.</div>
