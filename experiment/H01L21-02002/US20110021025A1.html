In case of conducting the lapping, free abrasive grains within a range of #1000 to 1500 are preferably used for the lapping. Instead of the lapping may be adopted a technique wherein high-accuracy planarization of the wafer is conducted by a grinding step using a flat-surface grinding machine or a double-sided simultaneous flat-surface grinding machine to reduce variation or undulation in the thickness of the wafer.

The printing position is on an outer peripheral portion of the wafer surface and in the vicinity of the notch. For example, an Nd:YAG laser is irradiated onto the laser mark-printing sites of the wafer surface at an output power of 10 to 100 W plural times to form a predetermined character or bar-code by laser marking.
