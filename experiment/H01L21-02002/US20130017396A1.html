</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an adhesive film for a semiconductor device, a film for the backside of a flip-chip semiconductor, and a dicing tape-integrated film for the backside of a semiconductor. The film for the backside of a flip-chip semiconductor is used for protecting the backside of a semiconductor element such as a semiconductor chip, for improving strength, and so on.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, there have been increasing demands for thickness reduction and size reduction of semiconductor devices and packages thereof. Because of that, a flip-chip type semiconductor device has been broadly used in which a semiconductor element such as a semiconductor chip is mounted on a substrate by flip-chip bonding (flip-chip connection) as a semiconductor device and a package thereof. In flip-chip connection, a semiconductor chip is fixed to a substrate in a condition that the circuit surface of the semiconductor chip is opposite to the electrode forming surface of the substrate. There are cases where damages of the semiconductor chip are prevented by protecting the backside of the semiconductor chip with a protective film in such a semiconductor device (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2008-166451, 2008-006386, 2007-261035, 2007-250970, 2007-158026, 2004-221169, 2004-214288, 2004-142430, 2004-072108, and 2004-063551, for example).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it is necessary to add a new step of pasting a protecting film to the backside of the semiconductor chip that is obtained in a dicing step to protect the backside of the semiconductor chip with the protecting film. As a result, the number of steps increases and manufacturing cost increases. In addition, the semiconductor chip may be damaged in a pickup step thereof as the semiconductor device has been becoming thinner in recent years. Because of this, a semiconductor wafer or the semiconductor chip is desired to be reinforced up to the pickup step to increase its mechanical strength. Further, a film such as the protecting film that is pasted to a semiconductor chip may be used after it is stored for a long period of time. The film is desired to have the same physical properties (such as the tensile storage modulus and adhering strength) as those at the time of manufacture even after it is stored for a long time. When the adhering strength is low after long term storage, the film cannot be pasted to a semiconductor wafer, and when the tensile storage modulus is high after long term storage, cracking and chipping are generated on the adhesive film and the film cannot be suitably used.</div>

Therefore, curing of the film due to progress of the curing reaction and a decrease of tackiness can be prevented, and the same physical properties as those before storage (right after manufacture) can be achieved even after long term storage.

Because the film for the backside of a semiconductor can also be pasted when the dicing tape is pasted to the backside of the semiconductor wafer before the dicing step, a step of pasting only a film for the backside of a semiconductor (a step of pasting a film for the backside of a semiconductor) is not necessary. As a result, the number of steps can be reduced. In addition, because the film for the backside of a semiconductor protects the semiconductor wafer and the backside of the semiconductor element that is formed by dicing, damages of the semiconductor element can be decreased or prevented in the dicing step and the steps following the dicing step such as a pickup step.
