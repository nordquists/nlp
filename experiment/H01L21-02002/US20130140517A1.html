<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to their direct bandgap and large tunable bandgap range, Gallium nitride (GaN) and related nitride compounds (InGaN, InAlN, and AlGaN) are widely used for optoelectronic and microelectronic devices, including light emitting diode (LED) devices, optical detectors, and high speed high power transistors. LED lights, for example, are efficient, reliable, and solid-state. Gallium nitride is used for most LED device manufacturing. Similar to silicon, GaN is now widely used in semiconductor industry. However, nearly all GaN and nitride products are rigid, relatively thick, and costly. Making flexible GaN has been a difficult task and there have been very few successes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Most recently, news from Yale University reported that Jung Han et al. developed a technique called nanoetching, which is similar to the anodization process in electrolytes, as known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. According to their methods, a GaN film was etched into porous structures with semi-directional pores normal to the film surface under low a voltage condition. Then, by tuning up the voltage for etching, the pores branch out in random directions. Finally, the pores break across the GaN surface, and the top porous structure may be released. However, one challenge is that during the etching process the top porous GaN structure is continuously etched, as well as the bulk GaN, which yields poor quality GaN. There are also limitations on the thickness which can be fabricated due to kinetics in the etching process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Richard C. Cope described an approach to realize flexible displays (see U.S. Pat. App. 2009/0219225 for Cope). The display panel contains a plurality of pixel chips and lighting units, all on a flexible film. In the Cope approach, multiple units are utilized on a flexible film. With current resolution requirements, hundreds of millions pixels are needed for desired resolution. Manufacturing costs for this type of product are predicted to be extraordinarily high. Wiring and controlling systems could also raise challenges.</div>

The Song method allows the etching process to be performed within the same growth chamber (see U.S. Pat. App. 2007/0082465 for Song).</div>

Luo, et al. disclosed a method utilizing a UV laser to lift off GaN substrate and transfer the GaN substrate from sapphire to silicon. The Luo group fabricated nitride LEDs including Indium Nitride and GaN on sapphire substrate. Then, by a laser lift-off and Palladium-Indium (Pd—In) bonding processes after the transfer, the GaN top structures were transferred onto silicon wafer (see also U.S. Pat.

The voids generated near the mask serve as a separation layer. (See J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 42, 2003). The above techniques require voids or pores for separating, which could extend into the GaN film and cause degradation in crystal quality.</div>

The Wong method grew GaN film on sapphire substrate. Then by laser irradiation which decomposed the interface between GaN and sapphire and Pd—In bonding after transfer, the GaN top structures was lifted. The Wong method has been the standard method for fabricating freestanding GaN substrate in industry. However, only one GaN substrate can be lifted from one sapphire wafer and the separating interface is defect rich, and therefore a thick dislocation blocking GaN layer is required on top of the separating interface to reduce defects (see W. S. Wong, T. Sands and N. W. Cheung, Appl. Phys. Lett. 72 (1998) pp. 599-601).</div>

According to several embodiments of the present disclosure, the separation process described herein (i.e., the InN—GaN superlattice separation method) has several advantages over the techniques of the prior art. With the process described here, the amount of Nitrogen gas produced is much smaller, thus thinner layers of GaN can be lift off. For example, GaN thin films within the range of approximately ten nm can be fabricated. It should be appreciated this method can also be used to fabricated thicker layers of GaN (about hundreds of nm thick). It should further be appreciated that no viable methods exist in the prior art to achieve a GaN layer as thin as 10 nm. Even for thicker intermediate thicknesses (e.g., hundreds of nm thick), a significant amount of mechanical planarization is needed according to existing methods described in the prior art. The method disclosed herein lowers materials cost by avoiding wasting a significant amount of GaN as a result of, e.g., mechanical planarization. This method also features an atomically flat finishing surface. Therefore, defect density as low as 10<sup>5 </sup>per cm<sup>2 </sup>can be achieved using the method disclosed herein. The products achieved by the method disclosed herein cover applications from LED luminescence to laser diodes and military radars. In addition, the biocompatibility of GaN may be increased by this liftoff technique for nanometer level devices as well. Thin devices may be implanted into human bodies for various biomedical applications.</div>

In order to anodize the thin metal layer <b>414</b>A into a porous anodic alumina <b>414</b>B, the thin metal layer <b>414</b>A is to be electropolished in a bath containing chromium oxide, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid for approximately 20 seconds. Then the backside of the wafer containing these structures and side surfaces are covered and protected by superglue or another polymer. Protection of the backside and side surfaces is to prevent anodization from occurring on the side surfaces of the thin metal layer <b>414</b>A. The thin metal layer <b>414</b>A is anodized in oxalic acid or sulfuric acid within a chiller bath below approximately 5° C. Anodization is completed once the current drops under approximately 0.1 mA.</div>

The etching methods are anisotropic (i.e., the methods are configured to etch the bottom of nanopores <b>414</b>E and are configured to keep the vertical sidewalls of nanopores <b>414</b>E intact).
