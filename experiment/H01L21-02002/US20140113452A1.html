<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, most wafers may have a bevel edge resulted by a wafer thinning process. When the mechanical stress or thermal stress generated by a semiconductor device fabricating process is imposed to the wafer, the existence of the bevel may cause uneven stress being subjected to the edge of the wafer, thus wafer crack and delamination may be triggered. Accordingly, a wafer edge trimming process is desired to remove the bevel edge before the semiconductor device fabricating process is carried out.</div>
