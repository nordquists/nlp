<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to apparatus for processing a semiconductor workpiece.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Plasma etching is extensively used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. Cost effective manufacturing of devices requires plasma etch systems to remove the required layers quickly while maintaining the customer specified uniformities (such as etch rate, and selectivity) within and between processed wafers. Frequently there is a compromise to be made between average etch rate and uniformity as in many cases uniformities in the process performance degrade as etch rate is increased.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">High rate anisotropic plasma etching of features in silicon wafers is typically achieved by the “Bosch process” [U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,893] or cyclic deposition/etch processes [U.S. Pat. No. 8,133,349]. Deposition and etch steps are cyclically carried out in a plasma etch tool to enable a relatively high removal rate of the silicon which is not protected by the mask. This type of process has widespread commercial application and is used to fabricate MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems), gyroscopes, accelerometers, sensors, through silicon vias (TSVs) and even wafer scribing or thinning. In all cases for cost reasons it is desirable to fabricate the part as rapidly as possible and as a consequence a great deal of effort has been applied to developing hardware and processes that enable the high etch rate of silicon.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">It should however be understood that process uniformity is also a very important consideration. In most applications a number of parts (die) are patterned over a wafer and amount of material being removed from all parts should be similar. Ideally they should be the same but in practice achieving identical conditions can be very difficult to achieve. Parts at the centre and the edge of the wafer should be processed in a similar fashion if the maximum yield is to be maintained. It is also desirable that etch rate is the same or similar across the whole wafer. If this is not the case some parts will be completed prior to others and in some cases this may prove to be detrimental to the parts that experience over etching. To complicate matters further plasma uniformity may also influence angle of a feature being etched into the masked silicon wafer. Frequently at the edge of the wafer some of the ions hit the wafer surface at less than normal incidence. This results in a slight “tilt” in the anisotropic feature being etched. U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,548 describes an ICP reactor where independent control of gas and RF can be applied to a series of concentric channels. By using concentric channels—generally in the same plane—some degree of radial plasma non-uniformity can be reduced near the channels. However, non-uniformities can still exist close to the wafer surface.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) Plasma etch tools frequently use an RF antenna placed around a ceramic bell jar to produce a dense plasma. A central gas feed provides the gas to be disassociated in the bell jar and plasma non-uniformities are reduced through the use of a “diffusion chamber” a large diameter chamber which is placed between the plasma source and the wafer platen assembly. The diffusion chamber allows the plasma to expand to beyond the edge of the wafer. Gas is pumped from the chamber through a gate valve to the bottom of the system. The platen assembly will normally have an electrostatic chuck to aid heat removal from the wafer and an RF bias to aid the etch/deposition process. Although the invention is not limited to ICP plasma etch tools, for the purposes of illustration the invention will now be described in relation to etch tools of this type.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the context of RF based, ICP plasma etch tools described in the accompanying drawings, features of the invention are as follows: a) two concentric RF sources, the primary source being located in the upper bell jar and the diameter of this jar being lower than that of the main chamber; b) two gas feeds, one to the primary source and the other being an annular arrangement to the upper part of the main chamber; and c) a conductance limiting path at the edge of the wafer to reduce the flow of gas at the wafer edge.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0047]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0048" num="0047">By judicious control of one or more of these factors, etch rate can be enhanced while uniformity can be maintained at acceptable levels. These features can be seen diagrammatically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">A secondary benefit of the invention is an improved plasma clean process capability. Plasma clean processes can be used to remove deposited material from the chamber walls. This is a very important factor which must be controlled to maintain wafer-wafer uniformity over time. An advantage of the present invention is that because the two plasma sources can be operated independently the operator can run clean regimes targeting specific areas of the chamber, (ICP only for main reaction chamber/high density plasma only for bell jar). The invention also makes it possible to shift the plasma around by using combination of the sources. More efficient cleaning will yield productivity benefits.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a first configuration of apparatus of the invention, shown generally at <b>10</b>. The primary gas feed <b>12</b> enters the primary chamber <b>14</b> (˜7-12 cm diameter dielectric cylinder) which has an associated primary ionization source <b>16</b>. An RF antenna <b>18</b> nominally 13.56 MHz acts as the ICP source. This can be assisted by a DC <b>20</b> coil to modify the confinement of the plasma. A Faraday shield <b>21</b> can be provided between the DC coil <b>20</b> and the wall of the primary chamber <b>14</b> to reduce capacitive coupling. The plasma from the primary source enters the main chamber <b>22</b> where the wafer <b>24</b> is placed on the wafer support <b>26</b>, which may be an electrostatic chuck. The wafer size could be up to 300 mm in standard production applications, although processing of still larger wafers is within the scope of the invention. The edge of the wafer <b>24</b> is protected by a wafer edge protection (WEP) device <b>28</b> to avoid excessive loss of silicon at the wafer edge where the resist edge bead has been removed. The main (secondary) chamber <b>22</b> has a secondary ionization source <b>30</b> having a secondary RF coil <b>32</b> placed around the main chamber <b>22</b> to provide a secondary plasma close to the chamber wall <b>22</b> <i>a. </i>The RF coil <b>32</b> could also operate at 13.56 MHz or a lower frequency such as 1-2 MHz. It is possible to include a Faraday shield between the secondary RF coil <b>32</b> and the wall of the main chamber <b>22</b>. This can be additional to the Faraday shield <b>21</b> positioned adjacent to primary chamber <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the Faraday shield positioned adjacent the main chamber <b>22</b> can be instead of the Faraday shield <b>21</b>, or no Faraday shield may be present. An annular gas distribution system <b>34</b> is incorporated into the main chamber <b>22</b> to provide an independent gas source for the secondary plasma. A conductance limiting pathway is introduced at the wafer edge. Gas flows above the WEP <b>28</b> and below an annular baffle <b>36</b> in a radial fashion to the pump <b>38</b> through a gate valve <b>39</b>. The typical but non-limiting height of this gap is 5-50 mm. The conductance limiting path can increase the residence time of active gas species at the wafer edge and hence improve process uniformity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0050">It is desirable that the WEP is maintained at an elevated temperature to reduce the deposition build up due to successive deposition cycles. This heating is preferably achieved by creating a plasma in the chamber <b>22</b> to heat all the interior before the wafer of interest is loaded. The plasma during the main process will ensure that the protection system continues to stay at a temperature of 85° C. to 150° C. This WEP system can have an internal diameter greater than the wafer diameter to ensure that the whole wafer is exposed to the plasma, but material is protected outside the wafer diameter. This material could include the tape and/or frame of a wafer supported by tape or an alternative carrier. Such a configuration is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a second configuration of apparatus of the invention, shown generally at <b>40</b>.

A wafer edge conductance limiting baffle <b>46</b> is attached above the wafer position, with an inner diameter close to the diameter of the wafer <b>24</b>. The gap between the wafer <b>24</b> (or parts sitting on the wafer support <b>26</b> around the wafer <b>24</b>) should be small enough to cause the etchant gas to mainly interact with the wafer <b>24</b> before being pumped around the side of the wafer support <b>26</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the gap between the WEP <b>28</b> which protects the tape <b>42</b> and frame <b>44</b> and the baffle <b>46</b> is identified by the arrow. A balance must be found between this mixing and the reduced conductance that this causes for pumping the etch products away from the wafer. As a guideline, the optimum gap size is often between 15 and 25 mm, although other constraints may cause the gap to be 5 to 50 mm. The baffle is applicable to many etch materials and process gases where a remote plasma source is used, including, but not limited to, Si, GaAs, polymer, Al, and fluorine, chlorine and oxygen based chemistries.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0054" num="0053">By using two independent sources—one primary source at the top of the chamber in a small ceramic/insulating container where the principal dissociation of the reactive gases will take place—and secondary auxiliary source between the primary source and the wafer—ideally close to the wafer—radial non-uniformities close to the wafer edge can be compensated by the auxiliary source. When using a single source the plasma density at the centre of the process chamber tends to be higher than at the edge. This is particularly pronounced using a small diameter tube as the first chamber. As the RF power applied to the antenna is increased, the non-uniformity can be increased. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> we can see not only improved uniformity for 200 mm wafers but also higher normalised etch rate due to the use of the secondary RF source. The RF power for the primary source was maintained a 3 kW for both sets of data but 1.5 kW power was used in the secondary source for the “hybrid source” measurements. Gas was only supplied to the primary source.</div>

Here the normalized etch rate for a 300 mm wafer can be seen gas flow solely to the primary source and when gas is supplied with a ratio of 2:1 between the primary and secondary sources. Increasing the gas low to the annular gas supply to the main chamber improves the uniformity of the plasma and in turn improves etch uniformity.</div>

Uniformity can be improved by reducing the depletion of reactive species at the wafer periphery and reducing the number of ions. This improves the uniformity across the wafer and therefore also allows a higher etch rate for a given uniformity by adjusting other process parameters which would normally worsen the uniformity.</div>

Such a coil structure could be mounted inside a chamber, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,963. Alternative magnetic plasma confinement means may be used in place of DC coils, and in other embodiments no magnetic plasma confinement means are used at all. The frequencies of the RF sources do not have to be the same, and any suitable combination of frequencies might be used. A non-limiting range of possible frequencies is 1-13.56 MHz.</div>
