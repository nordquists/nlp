<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">A metal plating process is performed for electroplating metal onto a semiconductor wafer, such as within trenches, via structures, or other portions of the semiconductor wafer. In an example, a seed layer, such as a copper layer, is formed over a surface of the semiconductor wafer. The seed layer carries electrical plating current from a wafer edge of the semiconductor wafer across the surface of the semiconductor wafer. The electrical plating current is supplied by a power source that is connected to an anode and is connected to the wafer edge as a cathode. The electrical plating current provides electrons that convert metal ions to metal atoms that accumulate on the surface of the semiconductor wafer. The seed layer has a resistance from the wafer edge to a center region of the semiconductor wafer, which results in a voltage drop causing a terminal effect where the electrical plating current is higher at the wafer edge than the center region. The higher electrical plating current results in a greater accumulation of metal atoms at the wafer edge than the center region, thus resulting in non-uniformity issues across the wafer.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It is evident, however, that the claimed subject matter can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more systems and methods for promoting metal plating profile uniformity are provided herein. A magnetic structure, such as a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, is used to modify electrical plating current so that the electrical plating current is substantially uniform across a surface of a semiconductor wafer during a metal plating process. Controlling the electrical plating current compensates for a resistance across the surface of the semiconductor wafer that would otherwise result in a relatively larger edge plating current than a center plating current, at times referred to as a terminal effect. The terminal effect results in more metal atom accumulating on a wafer edge of the semiconductor wafer than a center portion of the semiconductor wafer. In this way, maintaining a similar electrical plating current for the semiconductor wafer mitigates the terminal effect, and thus promotes uniform metal plating across the surface of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">A method <b>100</b> of promoting metal plating profile uniformity is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In an embodiment, a seed layer, such as a copper layer, is formed over a surface of a semiconductor wafer. The semiconductor wafer is placed into a container, such as a plating cell, within which a metal plating process is performed to electroplate metal onto the semiconductor wafer. The plating cell comprises an electrolyte solution that facilitates the metal plating process. An electrical plating current is supplied to the plating cell so that the electrical plating current provides electrons that convert metal ions, within the electrolyte solution, to metal atoms that accumulate on the surface of the semiconductor wafer. Because the seed layer creates a resistance between a wafer edge and a center portion of the semiconductor wafer, a voltage drop occurs between the wafer edge and center portion. The voltage drop results in a decreased center plating current with respect to an edge plating current. The decreased center plating current results in relatively less accumulation of metal atoms at the center portion compared to metal atom accumulation at the wafer edge. The difference in metal atom accumulation or metallization between the wafer edge and the center potion results in the semiconductor wafer having non-uniformity issues. Accordingly, as provided herein, a magnet structure is used to control the electrical plating current during the metal plating process so that the edge plating current and the center plating current have relatively similar current values.</div>

In an embodiment, the magnet structure is positioned outside the plating cell (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In an embodiment, the magnet structure is positioned inside the plating cell (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In an embodiment, the magnet structure is positioned surrounding the plating cell or surrounding the semiconductor wafer (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). The magnet structure is configured as a single structure (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) or is configured as a plurality of magnetic portions (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).</div>

In an embodiment, the force is applied to metal ions to move the metal ions away from the wafer edge of the semiconductor wafer. Moving the metal ions away from the wafer edge decreases an edge plating current associated with the wafer edge. In this way, the edge plating current is modified to a current value similar to a current value of the center plating current. In an embodiment, the force is applied to metal ions to move the metal ions towards the center portion of the semiconductor wafer. Moving the metal ions towards the center portion increases a center plating current associated with the center portion. In this way, the center plating current is modified to a current value similar to a current value of the edge plating current. Because the center plating current and the edge plating current have similar current values, metal atoms accumulate on the surface of the semiconductor wafer in a uniform or conformal manner so that the wafer edge and the center portion have similar thicknesses.

A rotational speed of the magnetic structure is modifiable during the metal plating process. In an embodiment, a position of the magnetic structure is modified from the first position to a second position with respect to the semiconductor wafer. The difference in the first position and the second position corresponds to a change in horizontal distance between the magnetic structure and the center portion of the semiconductor wafer or corresponds to a vertical distance between the magnetic structure and the surface of the semiconductor wafer. The magnetic structure is moved in a horizontal, vertical direction, or any other direction during the metal plating process. In an embodiment, a magnetic strength of the magnet structure is modified during the metal plating process, such as by adding or removing a number of permanent magnets or by changing a power setting of an electromagnet. The magnetic strength is changed to adjust a metal plating profile resulting from the metal plating process. In this way, the magnetic structure is used to control electrical plating current in a manner that promotes metal plating profile uniformity or any other desired metal plating profile.</div>
