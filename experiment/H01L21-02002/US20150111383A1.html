<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0002">Recently, the design rule for semiconductor devices have become more minute due to the increasing demand for the trend of higher recording capacity of a semiconductor memory. As a result, in a photolithography performed in the process of manufacturing the semiconductor device, the depth of focus is decreased, and the demand for the defect reduction and smoothness of silicon wafer (bare wafer) has become even further strict.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0003">For improving the quality of a silicon wafer, polishing of the silicon wafer is performed in multi-stages. In particular, a final polishing performed in the final stage of the polishing is performed to suppress the surface roughness (haze) and also suppress surface defects (LDP: Light Point Defects) such as particles, scratches and pits, which is achieved by improving wettability (hydrophilicity) of the polished silicon wafer surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0004">The size of the surface defects permissible for the silicon wafer surface has been decreased year after year. In general, the defect is measured by irradiating a wafer surface with a laser beam and detecting scattered light at that time. Therefore, for measuring more minute defects, it is required to reduce the surface roughness (haze) of the silicon wafer thereby improving the S/N ratio at the time of defect measurement.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0005">For the polishing liquid composition used for final polishing, a polishing liquid composition for chemical-mechanical polishing by use of colloidal silica and an alkali compound is known. Furthermore, a water-soluble polymer compound is added further to the above-mentioned polishing liquid composition in order to make a polishing liquid composition for improving further the haze level, and such a polishing liquid composition is reported (Patent document 1). Further, as a polishing liquid composition for decreasing the number of surface defects (LPD), a polishing liquid composition including a water-soluble macromolecular compound including a nitrogen-containing group is known (Patent document 2).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0006">Further, it has been disclosed that a polishing liquid composition containing a water-soluble macromolecular compound such as an acrylic amide derivative forms a protective film with respect to the metal surface so as to suppress corrosion, thereby improving the planarity (Patent document 3). And Patent document 4 suggests a polishing liquid containing silica sol and a N-alkyl substitution product of acrylamide as a polishing liquid for metal. The polishing liquid allows a speedy polishing, improves planarity, rarely forms a groove between a wiring and an insulating layer, and it has a high storage stability.</div>

However, as HEC is made from natural cellulose as a natural material, a water-insoluble matter derived from cellulose is included, which renders the quality instable. And as the water-insoluble matter become cores for agglomeration of silica particles, the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition deteriorates, and the agglomerate of the silica particles increases the number of surface defects (LPD). In some cases, the presence of the water-insoluble matter itself may increase the number of the surface defects (LPD). Therefor, in order to remove the agglomerate of silica particles and the water-insoluble matter, in general the polishing liquid composition is filtered immediately before its application. However, since the polishing liquid composition has a high viscosity due to the dissolved HEC and the filter clogs up due to the presence of the water-insoluble matter etc., it is required to lower the filtering precision. As a result, removal of the silica particle agglomerate and the water-insoluble matter is insufficient thereby causing degradation of the productivity of silicon wafers.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0018">The present invention is based on a finding that a water-soluble macromolecular compound including 10 wt % or more of the constitutional unit I represented by the general formula (1) above and having a weight average molecular weight of 50,000 or more and 1,500,000 or less is included in a polishing liquid composition for a silicon wafer (hereinafter it may be stated simply as “polishing liquid composition”) so that the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition is improved and it is possible to ensure the polishing rate to keep the favorable productivity (hereinafter, it may be stated simply as “ensuring a polishing rate”) and also to reduce the surface roughness (haze) and the surface defects (LPD) of the silicon wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0019">At present, as the polishing liquid composition used for polishing a silicon wafer, a polishing liquid composition including hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) as the water-soluble macromolecular compound is known in general. However, the HEC is made from natural cellulose, and thus HEC includes water-insoluble matters derived from cellulose and may cause problems such as increasing the number of surface defects. Therefore, it is required to remove the water-insoluble matter from the HEC aqueous solution before application for preparation of the polishing liquid composition. And furthermore, for removing silica agglomerate that is generated around cores of the remaining water-insoluble matter, there is a necessity of filtering the polishing liquid composition after preparation of the polishing liquid composition and in particular, immediately before performing the polishing. Filtering has been known as a method for removing the water-insoluble matter. However, a HEC aqueous solution has a high viscosity although HEC is water soluble. Therefore, the filter will clog up soon if the filtering precision is not lowered, and production of the polishing liquid composition is interrupted. As a result, the remaining water-insoluble matter causes instability in quality or degradation in storage stability of the polishing liquid composition. It is difficult to industrially use such a polishing liquid composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0020">In light of this, it is expected to solve the problem by replacing the HEC by at least one kind of synthetic macromolecular compound selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and poly(N-vinyl formamide). However, even by adding the synthetic macromolecular compound to the polishing liquid composition, sufficient effects cannot be achieved in reducing the surface roughness (haze) and the surface defects (LPD) of the object to be polished.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0021">In contrast, in the present invention, a water-soluble macromolecular compound including 10 wt % or more of the constitutional unit I represented by the above described general formula (1) and having a weight average molecular weight of 50,000 or more and 1,500,000 or less is used as a substitute of HEC. Thereby, the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition is improved, and furthermore, it is possible to raise the effect of reducing the surface roughness (haze) and surface defects (LPD) of the object that has been polished with the polishing liquid composition, and the polishing rate can be ensured. Although the details of the mechanism of developing the effect of the present invention has not been clarified, it is assumed as follows.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0022">The surface roughness (haze) of an object polished by use of the polishing liquid composition is under influences of a cutting force proportional to the size of the polishing particles (particle diameter) and a degree of corrosion caused by a nitrogen-containing basic compound as a polishing accelerator. In a case where the water-soluble macromolecular compound used for preparation of the polishing liquid composition has a weak interaction with the silica particles, agglomerate between the silica particles cannot be suppressed, the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition deteriorates, and the particle diameter of the secondary agglomerate of the silica particles is increased. As a result, the cutting force is increased, the surface roughness is degraded and the surface defects (LPD) is increased. On the other hand, in a case where the water-soluble macromolecular compound used for preparation of the polishing liquid composition has a weak interaction with the silicon wafer, it is considered that the corrosion of the silicon wafer proceeds, and the nitrogen-containing basic compound causes the roughness of the silicon wafer surface. However, the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) has a predetermined weight average molecular weight, includes 10 wt % or more of the constitutional unit I, and includes, in the constitutional unit I, both an amide group as a site to exhibit hydrophilicity for interacting with the silica particles and at least either an alkyl group or a hydroxyl group as a site exhibiting hydrophobicity for interacting with the silicon wafer. Therefor, the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) is adsorbed suitably to the silicon wafer surface and suppresses the corrosion caused by the nitrogen-containing basic compound, whereby a favorable surface roughness (haze) is achieved and a favorable wettability is developed to suppress adhesion of particles due to the drying of the wafer surface so as to allow reduction of the surface defects (LPD).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0023">In general, under an alkaline condition, both the surfaces of the silica particles and of the wafer are charged negatively, and due to the charge repulsion, the silica particles cannot get close to the wafer and the polishing rate cannot be developed sufficiently. However, by making the water-soluble macromolecular compound of the present invention (component C) be present, the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) is adsorbed onto the surfaces of both of the silica particles and the wafer, and thus the binder effect is developed. As a result, the interaction between the silica particles and the wafer is increased and the polishing by the silica particles proceeds effectively, and thus, the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) is considered as contributing to ensuring the rate of polishing the silicon wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0024">Only when the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) is 50,000 or more and 1,500,000 or less and 10 wt % or more of the constitutional unit I is included in the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C), the water-soluble macromolecular compound (component C) is adsorbed suitably to the silicon wafer surface and to the silica particle surface. Thereby, the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition is improved, and the surface roughness and the surface defects (LPD) are reduced. In addition to that, a favorable polishing rate is ensured. However, the present invention is not limited to these assumptions.</div>

In Comparative Example 7 where the pH of the polishing liquid composition at 25° C. is greater than 12.0, the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition was favorable, but problems occurred. Namely, the device, the container or the like is degraded, and problems in handling (e.g., a high jeopardy to human bodies) occur. When the pH of the polishing liquid composition at 25° C. is 8.0 or more, in particularly, 9.0 or more, suppression of agglomeration of silica particles is remarkable, and thus the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition is improved, and furthermore, the effect of reducing the surface roughness and the surface defects of the silicon wafer is high. The evaluation of the storage stability was conducted with respect to a polishing liquid composition before dilution by 40 times. If the storage stability of the polishing liquid composition in a concentrated liquid state is favorable, similarly the storage stability of the diluted polishing liquid composition is favorable as long as the pH at 25° C. is 8.0 to 12.0, preferably 9.0 to 11.5, and more preferably 9.5 to 11.0.</div>
