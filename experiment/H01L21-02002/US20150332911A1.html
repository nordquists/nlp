</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of processing a wafer, and more particularly to an edge trimming method of partially removing a chamfered portion on the outer circumferential edge of a wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor wafers have many devices such as ICs, LSI circuits, etc. formed on their front surfaces and divided by a grid-like pattern of division lines (streets). Such a semiconductor wafer is machined to a predetermined thickness by having its reverse side ground by a grinding device, and then cut into individual devices along the division lines by a cutting apparatus (dicing saw). The divided devices are widely used in various electronic devices such as mobile phones, personal computers, etc. To meet demands in recent years for smaller electronic devices, semiconductor wafers, which may hereinafter be referred to simply as “wafers,” with a plurality of devices formed thereon are required to be ground to a smaller thickness, e.g., a thickness of 100 μm or less, or a thickness of 50 μm or less. Depending on devices to be fabricated, the step of grinding the reverse side of a wafer may be followed by other steps, such as the step of covering the reverse side with a metal film and the step of cleaning the reverse side.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to prevent a wafer from being cracked or from producing dust during the fabrication process, the outer circumferential edge of the wafer is chamfered to an arcuate cross-sectional shape extending from the front surface to reverse side thereof. Therefore, when the wafer is ground to a smaller thickness, the chamfered outer circumferential edge of the wafer is shaped like a knife edge. However, the chamfered outer circumferential edge of the wafer that has been shaped like a knife edge tends to chip off, breaking the wafer. Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2007-152906 discloses a wafer processing method in which the chamfered outer circumferential edge of a wafer is partly removed with a cutting blade, i.e., an edge trimming step is carried out, followed by grinding the reverse side of the wafer until the thickness of the wafer becomes a finished thickness for devices to be fabricated from the wafer.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the edge trimming step is carried out by cutting into the chamfered outer circumferential edge of the wafer with a cutting blade from the front surface of the wafer, contaminants produced in the edge trimming step are attached to the devices on the front surface of the wafer. The contaminants that are attached to the front surfaces of the devices are problematic because they tend to cause a device failure.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of processing a wafer while reducing the risk of causing a device failure even when an edge trimming step is carried out on the wafer.</div>

The sheet is applied to the front surface of the wafer by the adhesive placed on the outer circumferential excess region of the wafer.
