<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicon carbide (below, indicated as “SiC”) is excellent in heat resistance and mechanical strength and is physically and chemically stable, and so is focused on as an environmentally-resistant semiconductor material. Further, in recent years, demand for epitaxial SiC wafers has been rising as substrates for high frequency and high withstand voltage electronic devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">When using an epitaxial SiC wafer to produce a power device, high frequency device, etc., in general, the thermal CVD method (thermal chemical vapor deposition method) is used to epitaxially grow an SiC thin film on an SiC single-crystal substrate (below, referred to as an “SiC substrate”) and the ion implantation method is used to directly implant a dopant. In the latter case, after implantation, high temperature annealing becomes necessary, but formation of a thin film by epitaxial growth is a widely used technique.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, in general, to obtain an SiC substrate, an SiC single-crystal ingot is cut to a predetermined thickness using a wire saw etc., lapped to reduce the variation in thickness, and polished to reduce the damaged surface layer, then finally subjected to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Further, in some cases, this is further etched by gas to finish the SiC substrate (see PLTs 1 and 2).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, the development of SiC devices have been advanced at a fast pace. The need for handling larger current densities has been increasing. Due to this, the device areas have been increasing. As typical defects which are present at an epitaxial SiC wafer, there are triangular defects, carrot defects, and comet defects. Reduction of these as “device killer defects” has been strongly sought. At the present time, the density of these epitaxial defects is of the level of several defects to 10 or so defects or so per cm<sup>2</sup>, but the number of epitaxial defects which are contained in a device has to be substantially zero. It is difficult to produce devices which have areas larger than 5 mm square or so with a high yield. To reduce the epitaxial defects, the growth temperature at the time of epitaxial growth, the ratio of the number of carbon atoms to the number of silicon atoms (C/Si ratio) in the material gases which flow at the time of growth, the treatment before growth, and various other conditions have been studied and optimized, but it is difficult to stably obtain a low epitaxial defect density of 1 to 2/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">Below, the present invention will be explained in detail. First, the treatment of the surface of the SiC substrate will be explained. In general, the surface treatment is comprised of shape control (lapping) of the wafer which is cut out from an ingot, reduction (polishing) of the damaged surface layer, and the final CMP.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">Here, “CMP” is one of the polishing techniques which simultaneously gives the surface of a treated object a mechanical action and chemical action to obtain a surface which is free from a damaged surface layer. In the method according to “CMP”, the chemicals in the slurry cause the formation of oxides at the surface and the oxides are simultaneously removed by polishing abrasives so as not to leave a damaged surface layer at the polished surface. As the slurry for CMP of an SiC substrate, there is a colloidal silica slurry in which hydrogen peroxide is included or slurry which is developed especially for SiC substrates (see Semiconductor SiC Technology and Applications, second edition, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun). The particle size of the polishing abrasives, the amount of the polishing agent, the components and pH of the slurry, the treatment pressure at the time of CMP, the surface plate rotation, and other conditions are adjusted to determine the surface properties after processing. For the treatment time, usually the thickness of the damaged surface layer after polishing is 100 nm or so, therefore the polishing time is set so that this is removed and no polishing flaws remain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">The surface of above-mentioned SiC substrate that is obtained is subjected to epitaxial growth. The epitaxial growth will be explained below. The apparatus which is preferably used in the present invention for epitaxial growth is a horizontal type CVD apparatus. The CVD process is simple in hardware configuration and enables control of the thickness of epitaxial growth by turning the supply of gas on/off, so this is a growth process which is excellent in control and reproducibility of the epitaxial film.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows together the typical growth sequence by the CVD process at the time of growing an epitaxial film together with the timing of introduction of gas. First, an SiC substrate is set in a growth furnace, the inside of the growth furnace is evacuated to a vacuum, then hydrogen gas is introduced to adjust the pressure to 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>to 3×10<sup>4 </sup>Pa. After that, the pressure is held constant while raising the temperature of the growth furnace to 1550 to 1650° C. that is growth temperature, then the material gases SiH<sub>4 </sub>and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4 </sub>and the doping gas N<sub>2 </sub>are introduced to start the growth. At this time, the flow rate of SiH<sub>4 </sub>is made 40 to 50 cm<sup>3 </sup>per minute, the flow rate of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4 </sub>is made 20 to 40 cm<sup>3 </sup>per minute, and the speed of growth is made 6 to 7 μm per minute. Since the usually used epitaxial layer has a film thickness of 10 μm or so, the growth speed is determined considering the productivity. When the desired film thickness is obtained, the introduction of SiH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2 </sub>is stopped and only hydrogen gas is run. In that state, the temperature is lowered. After the temperature falls to ordinary temperature, the introduction of hydrogen gas is stopped, the inside of the growth chamber is evacuated to a vacuum, inert gas is introduced into the growth chamber, the growth chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure, then the SiC wafer is taken out.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">A photo of a carrot defect which is formed after epitaxial growth is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a photo of the surface of an SiC substrate after CMP (before epitaxial growth) at the same location as the location shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the arrow part corresponds to the starting part of the carrot defect. An AFM image of this starting part is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As will be understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an approximately circular pit with a diameter of about 0.5 to 1 μm is formed. The depth was about 70 nm. Further, a photo of the surface conditions after etching this approximately circular part by molten KOH is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at the approximately circular part, a large hexagonal shaped etch pit appears. It will be understood that a screw dislocation which is present inside the SiC substrate corresponds to this. That is, it is clear that part of a screw dislocation which is present in the SiC substrate forms an approximately circular pit as explained above in the substrate surface due to CMP and that a carrot defect occurs starting from this.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">As explained above, as the mechanism of CMP, it is believed that the polishing solution oxidizes the surface of the SiC substrate and the oxidized layer is removed by the polishing agent particles. However, at the screw dislocation parts, the crystallinity is disturbed, so the oxidation speed becomes faster than at other parts and as a result the amount which is removed by polishing becomes greater. As a result, it is believed that approximately circular pits are formed at the surface of the SiC substrate. Therefore, the inventors engaged in detailed studies whereupon they found the fact that when the approximately circular pits have a diameter of 0.5 μm to 1.5 μm and a depth of 50 nm to 500 nm, carrot defects occur by a probability of substantially 100% after epitaxial growth. The fact that carrot defects are formed by partial break-up of screw dislocations which are present in the SiC substrate at the time of epitaxial growth is known (see H. Tsuchida, M. Ito, I. Kamata, and M. Nagano: Phys. Status Solidi B 246, No. 7, 1553-1568 (2009)). It is believed that at the screw dislocation parts which are accompanied with the above such approximately circular pits, there are step differences at the surface and disturbances in the crystallinity, so the break-up occurs more easily and as a result carrot defects occur with a higher probability.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">If the approximately circular pits which are formed at the surface of an SiC substrate have a diameter smaller than 0.5 μm and a depth shallower than 50 nm, the step differences at the surface will be small and the disturbances in the crystallinity will be small, so the probability of formation of carrot defects will become lower. Further, if the approximately circular pits have a diameter smaller than 0.5 μm and a depth deeper than 500 nm, it is believed that growth inside the pits will not advance, so the pits will remain substantially in their original form, but since they are small pits, the effect on the devices which are formed over them would be small. On the other hand, it is believed that if the approximately circular pits have a diameter larger than 1.5 μm, step flow growth from around the screw dislocations which cause the formation of pits becomes dominant, so the disturbance in crystallinity at the above screw dislocation parts is reversed, break-up of the screw dislocations becomes harder, and the formation of carrot defects is suppressed without regard as to the depth of the pits. That is, if an SiC substrate before epitaxial growth has approximately circular pits with a diameter of 0.5 μm to 1.5 μm and with a depth of 50 nm to 500 nm, the probability of formation of carrot defects at the epitaxial film will end up becoming high.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">At general epitaxial films, currently the density of epitaxial defects, including various defects, is overall several defects to 10 defects per cm<sup>2 </sup>in level, but among these, the density of triangular defects, comet defects, etc. is 1/cm<sup>2 </sup>or so. Therefore, the majority are carrot defects. Among the carrot defects, there are also ones which occur due to normal screw dislocations which are not accompanied with morphological characteristics such as the above approximately circular pits, but the density of these is small, so unless reducing the density of the carrot defects which start from screw dislocations accompanied with these approximately circular pits, that is, the density of approximately circular pits itself, to 1/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less in level, the overall defect density cannot be made 1 to 2/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less. Note that, “approximately circular pits” include not only pits with shapes at the SiC substrate surface of true circles, but also pits which are not perfectly circular. When not perfect circles, the “pit diameter” shall mean the circle equivalent diameter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">Focusing on the density of approximately circular pits which have the above such sizes at the SiC substrate, the inventors studied the relationship of the CMP polishing rate and polishing amount, whereupon they found that if the polishing rate is 100 nm/h or less and the amount of polishing is 100 nm or more, the density of approximately circular pits is suppressed to 1/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less. The CMP polishing rate is believed to be related to the processing pressure and the chemical activity etc. of the polishing solution. It is believed that the speed of oxidation at the screw dislocation parts and the number of screw dislocations which are reacted are varied by changing the polishing rate. Therefore, by adjusting the polishing rate, control of the shape and density of the approximately circular pits becomes possible. Further, the amount of polishing that should be removed by CMP, that is, the thickness of the damaged surface layer after polishing, is usually 50 to 100 nm or so. If the amount of removal is insufficient, control of the shape and density of the approximately circular pits will become difficult, so the damaged surface layer has to be sufficiently removed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the present invention, an SiC substrate which is controlled in shape and density of approximately circular pits can be prepared. An epitaxial film with few defects which is grown on the SiC substrate can be obtained. However, in order to make the CMP substantially proceed, the polishing rate has to be made 10 nm/h or more. Here, if overly lowering the CMP polishing rate, a problem arises in the productivity, so the polishing rate is preferably made 50 nm/h to 100 nm/h, more preferably 50 nm/h to 80 nm/h. Further, regarding the amount of polishing by CMP, it is sufficient that the occurrence of carrot defects be suppressed. If considering the productivity, the upper limit of the amount of polishing is 1000 nm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, if the approximately circular pits can be made further smaller and shallower, the frequency of carrot defects which are formed there can be expected to become smaller. Therefore, after predetermined CMP treatment, it is effective to again treat the surface by reactive ion etching (below, referred to as “RIE”). However, in this case, it is possible that due to the reaction with the screw dislocation parts, etching will be locally promoted and conversely the pits will become larger and deeper in shape, so the gas which is used is desirably He, Ar, or another noble gas.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">The epitaxial SiC wafer which is formed by using the SiC substrate which is obtained by the present invention can be used for various applications. In particular, by using an SiC substrate with an angle of inclination with respect to the (0001) plane of the SiC single-crystal in the &lt;11-20&gt; axial direction, defined as the “off-angle”, of 4° or less, an epitaxial film which is reduced in defect density and also basal plane dislocation density is obtained, so this is suitable for devices in which high reliability is demanded or bipolar devices. In particular, as devices which are preferably formed on the obtained epitaxial SiC wafer, Schottky barrier diodes, PIN diodes, MOS diodes, MOS transistors, and other such devices which are used for power control may be mentioned.</div>
