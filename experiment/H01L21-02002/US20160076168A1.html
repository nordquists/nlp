</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0026">Gallium nitride (GaN) and its related group III nitride alloys are the key material for various optoelectronic and electronic devices such as LEDs, LDs, microwave power transistors, and solar-blind photo detectors. Currently LEDs are widely used in displays, indicators, general illuminations, and LDs are used in data storage disk drives. However, the majority of these devices are grown epitaxially on heterogeneous substrates, such as sapphire and silicon carbide because GaN substrates are extremely expensive compared to these heteroepitaxial substrates. The heteroepitaxial growth of group III nitride causes highly defected or even cracked films, which hinder the realization of high-end optical and electronic devices, such as high-brightness LEDs for general lighting or high-power microwave transistors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0027">To solve fundamental problems caused by heteroepitaxy, it is indispensable to utilize crystalline group III nitride. For the majority of devices, crystalline GaN wafers are favorable because it is relatively easy to control the conductivity of the wafer and GaN wafer will provide the smallest lattice/thermal mismatch with device layers. However, due to the high melting point and high nitrogen vapor pressure at elevated temperature, it has been difficult to grow GaN crystal ingots. Currently, the majority of commercially available GaN wafers are produced by a method called hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0028">To obtain bulk crystals of GaN, from which GaN wafers can be sliced, various growth methods such as ammonothermal growth, flux growth, high-temperature solution growth have been developed. Ammonothermal method grows group III nitride crystals in supercritical ammonia [1-6]. The flux method and the high-temperature solution growth use a melt of group III metal. However, these methods typically require a GaN seed crystal. Since single crystalline GaN does not exist in nature, GaN wafers grown by HVPE are typically used as a seed crystal.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0029">To produce group III-nitride wafers by HVPE, a thick layer (&gt;500 microns) of group III-nitride is grown on a substrate, typically sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon or gallium arsenide. Then, the substrates are removed by mechanical grinding, laser-assisted separation or chemical etching. These methods, however, require additional process to remove the substrates.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0030">There are several technologies on spontaneous separation (or auto-separation, self-separation, self-delamination) of the thick GaN film if a special buffer layer or patterning is made on the front side of crystalline substrates. For example, periodic Sift stripe mask on the front side of the sapphire substrate enables selective growth of GaN [7]. Since the GaN layer is only partially adhered on the sapphire substrate, the thick GaN layer delaminates from the substrates upon cooling after growth. Similarly, creating periodic trenches on the front side of the substrate results in so-called cantilever epitaxy, and coalesced layer also tends to delaminate upon cooling. These selective growths typically change the propagation direction of dislocations, resulting in annihilation of the dislocations. However, this causes uneven distribution of dislocations on the surface of GaN, which is not favorable in lapping and polishing. In particular, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) utilizes chemical effect, which is sensitive to dislocations. Uneven distribution of dislocations causes height fluctuation after CMP.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Overview</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0067]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0067">The substrate of this invention in one instance enables thick growth of group III nitride such as GaN with reduced bow and optional spontaneous separation. Group III nitride is commonly used for optoelectronic devices and electronic devices although majority of devices utilizes heteroepitaxial substrates such as sapphire, silicon carbide, and silicon. This is due to lack of low-cost, high-quality free-standing group-III nitride wafers. Recently, GaN substrates have been produced with hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), ammonothermal method, and flux method, and AlN wafers have been produced with HVPE and physical vapor transport methods. Among these methods, HVPE is most commonly used. HVPE production of GaN substrates involves growth of a thick GaN layer on a substrate and removal of the substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0068]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0068">When a thick layer of GaN or other group III nitride is grown on a heteroepitaxial substrate, the layer is highly stressed due to mismatches of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient. This stress causes bowing of the layer and the substrate. If the bowing exceeds the critical value, the layer and/or the substrate will crack. In addition, even homoepitaxial growth of bulk/thick GaN on GaN substrate sometimes causes bowing and cracking Thus, it is important to reduce bowing of the thick layer and/or substrate on which it is grown by reducing stress.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0069]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0069">Another issue in the production process of a group III nitride such as GaN by HVPE is removal of the substrate. Several methods, such as mechanical grinding, laser lift-off and chemical etching, are currently used although these methods require an additional process to separate the substrate and new growth. Several cases of spontaneous separation of the GaN layer from the substrates have been reported. One method utilizes selective growth with a mask or trenches, nevertheless the selective growth results in gathering of dislocations in one region, leading to non-uniform distribution of dislocations. The termination points of these dislocations at the surface often cause pits during CMP process, therefore non-uniform distribution of the dislocations would cause macroscopic thickness variation over the wafer.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0007">Technical Description of the Invention</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0070]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0070">This invention discloses a substrate for growth of a thick layer of group III nitride and which substrate may address one or more of the issues discussed above. The substrate has a major surface at a first or front side which is prepared for epitaxial growth of group III nitride, and the substrate has a second major surface or back side that is opposite to the first side and that has a plurality of grooves. The grooves reduce stress in the epitaxially-deposited group III nitride that is caused by epitaxial growth of group III nitride on a substrate, especially as compared to an otherwise identical substrate that has no grooves on the comparative substrate or as compared to an otherwise identical substrate that has grooves on the first or front side of a comparative substrate on which group III nitride is to be grown.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0071]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0071">The first side of the substrate, which preferably has no grooves, can have a highly-polished surface and/or one or more buffer layers such as AlN or GaN applied to it to make the surface of the first side suitable for epitaxial deposition, whereas the second side may not be polished or as highly polished and/or may not have buffer layers applied to it. The second side may therefore not be suitable for epitaxial deposition, although in one variation of the invention the second side is also suitable for epitaxial deposition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0072]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0072">The substrate can be amorphous, polycrystalline, or single crystalline and can be a heteroepitaxial material such as quartz, glass, sapphire, silicon carbide or silicon, or the substrate may be a homoepitaxial material such as GaN or AlN. The substrate can have wurtzite crystal structure, for instance. In some instances, the substrate is single crystalline silicon, sapphire, GaN, or AlN. A substrate is typically at least 250 microns thick. A substrate may be at least 500 microns thick, or thickness may be between 250 and 500 microns, for instance.</div>
