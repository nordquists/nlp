<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Through-wafer vias are typically used to form connections between different die in a stacked configuration. Such vias can be formed by forming circuitry at one of the major surfaces of a wafer. The wafer is then thinned by backgrinding or other mechanical operation, and then vias are formed through all or substantially all of the remaining thickness of the wafer. Each via has a width that is similar to but slightly smaller than the area occupied by a bond pad. The vias consist of bulk silicon, polysilicon, an elemental metal, a metal alloy, a conductive metal nitride, or a combination thereof and do not include a discrete internal feature. In other words, the vias are simple miniature wires.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional processes of fabricating through-wafer vias can cause surface deformations along the die. Cracks, residue, and material left on the die can cause wire bonding attachment complications and device issues, or failure. Industries continue to demand improved electronic devices which do not include deformations caused by traditional processes of through-wafer via formation.</div>

The process disclosed in the patent is a well-known process for high aspect ratio deep silicon etching that cycles between isotropic surface passivation of the trench walls, reactive ion etch passivation clearing at the trench bottom, and isotropic silicon etching of the trench bottom opening. In an embodiment, the selectivity of silicon to an organic resist material can be in a range of approximately 80:1 to 100:1. If a mask uses a metal that is not significantly etched by fluorine, such as an AlN mask, the selectivity can be substantially higher. Vertical or tapered or shaped trenches can be controlled by the etching conditions. After forming the trenches, the optional mask layer is removed.</div>
