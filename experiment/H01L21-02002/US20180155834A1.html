<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuits are made possible by processes which produce intricately patterned material layers on substrate surfaces. Producing patterned materials on a substrate requires controlled methods for deposition and removal of material layers. Modern semiconductor manufacturing processing applies increasing emphasis on the integration of films without air breaks between process steps. Such a requirement poses a challenge for equipment manufacturers to allow integration of various process chambers into a single tool.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">One process that has become popular for deposition of thin films is atomic layer deposition (ALD). Atomic layer deposition is a method in which a substrate is exposed to a precursor which chemisorbs to the substrate surface followed by a reactant which reacts with the chemisorbed precursor. ALD processes are self-limiting and can provide molecular level control of film thicknesses. However, ALD processing can be time consuming due to the need to purge the reaction chamber between exposures to the precursors and reactants.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0028">A “wafer” or “substrate” as used herein, refers to any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which film processing is performed during a fabrication process. For example, a substrate surface on which processing can be performed include materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, strained silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, amorphous silicon, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, semiconductor wafers. Substrates may be exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate, anneal, UV cure, e-beam cure and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to film processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in the present invention, any of the film processing steps disclosed may also be performed on an underlayer formed on the substrate as disclosed in more detail below, and the term “substrate surface” is intended to include such underlayer as the context indicates. Thus for example, where a film/layer or partial film/layer has been deposited onto a substrate surface, the exposed surface of the newly deposited film/layer becomes the substrate surface.</div>

Some embodiments further extend the capability to perform various processes of film deposition or removal without need to transport wafers outside of the system until completion. Some embodiments can be advantageously used with selective deposition and etch processes without air breaks.</div>

If not, <b>780</b> and <b>785</b> are repeated until the predetermined numbers of wafers have been processed through each of the first single wafer processing chamber and the first batch processing chamber.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0082]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0074" num="0082">Once all of the wafers have been unloaded form the batch process chamber, the process is completed <b>795</b> and any additional processing can occur. For example, the wafers can be transferred to another processing platform for additional process steps to be performed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0083]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0075" num="0083">In some embodiments, both the first single wafer processing chamber <b>140</b> and first batch processing chamber <b>120</b> are utilized at the same time as the second single wafer processing chamber <b>150</b> and the second batch processing chamber <b>130</b>. The process sequence for the second processing chambers is the same as for the first processing chambers. If the second batch processing chamber is configured to perform a different process than the first batch processing chamber, the timing of the robots can be coordinated to operate both processes simultaneously. If both the first and second batch process chambers and the first and second single wafer processing chambers are configured to perform the same process, the start times of each process can be staggered so that the robot arms can efficiently move the wafers for both process trains without interference. In some embodiments, the processes occurring in the first process train (the first single wafer process chamber and the first batch process chamber) is moved along by the first robot arm while the second robot arm is operating the second process train (the second single wafer process chamber and the second batch process chamber).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0084]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0076" num="0084">According to one or more embodiments, the substrate is subjected to processing prior to and/or after forming the layer. This processing can be performed in the same chamber or in one or more separate processing chambers. In some embodiments, the substrate is moved from the first chamber to a separate, second chamber for further processing. The substrate can be moved directly from the first chamber to the separate processing chamber, or it can be moved from the first chamber to one or more transfer chambers, and then moved to the separate processing chamber. Accordingly, the processing apparatus may comprise multiple chambers in communication with a transfer station. An apparatus of this sort may be referred to as a “cluster tool” or “clustered system,” and the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0085]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0077" num="0085">Generally, a cluster tool is a modular system comprising multiple chambers which perform various functions including substrate center-finding and orientation, degassing, annealing, deposition and/or etching. According to one or more embodiments, a cluster tool includes at least a first chamber and a central transfer chamber. The central transfer chamber may house a robot that can shuttle substrates between and among processing chambers and load lock chambers. The transfer chamber is typically maintained at a vacuum condition and provides an intermediate stage for shuttling substrates from one chamber to another and/or to a load lock chamber positioned at a front end of the cluster tool. Two well-known cluster tools which may be adapted for the present invention are the Centura® and the Endura®, both available from Applied Materials, Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif. However, the exact arrangement and combination of chambers may be altered for purposes of performing specific steps of a process as described herein. Other processing chambers which may be used include, but are not limited to, cyclical layer deposition (CLD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), etch, pre-clean, chemical clean, thermal treatment such as RTP, plasma nitridation, degas, orientation, hydroxylation and other substrate processes. By carrying out processes in a chamber on a cluster tool, surface contamination of the substrate with atmospheric impurities can be avoided without oxidation prior to depositing a subsequent film.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0086]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0078" num="0086">According to one or more embodiments, the substrate is continuously under vacuum or “load lock” conditions, and is not exposed to ambient air when being moved from one chamber to the next. The transfer chambers are thus under vacuum and are “pumped down” under vacuum pressure. Inert gases may be present in the processing chambers or the transfer chambers. In some embodiments, an inert gas is used as a purge gas to remove some or all of the reactants. According to one or more embodiments, a purge gas is injected at the exit of the deposition chamber to prevent reactants from moving from the deposition chamber to the transfer chamber and/or additional processing chamber. Thus, the flow of inert gas forms a curtain at the exit of the chamber.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0087]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0079" num="0087">The substrate can be processed in single substrate deposition chambers, where a single substrate is loaded, processed and unloaded before another substrate is processed. The substrate can also be processed in a continuous manner, similar to a conveyer system, in which multiple substrate are individually loaded into a first part of the chamber, move through the chamber and are unloaded from a second part of the chamber. The shape of the chamber and associated conveyer system can form a straight path or curved path. Additionally, the processing chamber may be a carousel in which multiple substrates are moved about a central axis and are exposed to deposition, etch, annealing, cleaning, etc. processes throughout the carousel path.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0088]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0080" num="0088">During processing, the substrate can be heated or cooled. Such heating or cooling can be accomplished by any suitable means including, but not limited to, changing the temperature of the substrate support and flowing heated or cooled gases to the substrate surface. In some embodiments, the substrate support includes a heater/cooler which can be controlled to change the substrate temperature conductively. In one or more embodiments, the gases (either reactive gases or inert gases) being employed are heated or cooled to locally change the substrate temperature. In some embodiments, a heater/cooler is positioned within the chamber adjacent the substrate surface to convectively change the substrate temperature.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0089]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0081" num="0089">The substrate can also be stationary or rotated during processing. A rotating substrate can be rotated continuously or in discreet steps. For example, a substrate may be rotated throughout the entire process, or the substrate can be rotated by a small amount between exposures to different reactive or purge gases. Rotating the substrate during processing (either continuously or in steps) may help produce a more uniform deposition or etch by minimizing the effect of, for example, local variability in gas flow geometries.</div>
