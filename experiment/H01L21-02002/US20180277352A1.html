<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to heater used in semiconductor processing, and more specifically to a heater with multiple heater zones and thermocouples to monitor those zones.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">Description of Related Art</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor manufacturing, silicon substrates (wafers) are processed at elevated temperatures for deposition of numerous different materials. Temperatures typically range in the 300-550 C range, but can at times go as high as 750 C or even higher. The deposited materials are “grown” in a layer on the surface of the wafer. Many of these materials have growth rates which are extremely sensitive to temperature, so variations of the temperature across the wafer can affect the local growth rate of the film, causing variations in the film thickness as it is grown across the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desired to control the variations in thickness of the deposited films. Sometimes it is desired to have the films thicker in the center of the wafer (like a dome). Sometimes it is desired to have the films thicker on the edge (like a crater or dimple). Sometimes it is desired to have the film thickness as even as possible (within tens of angstroms).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the most direct methods for controlling the temperature of the wafer, and thereby the thickness profile of the as-deposited films, is to place the wafer on a heater. By designing the heater with a specific watt-density “map” which produces the temperature profile desired on the wafer, the desired film thickness profile can be produced. Watt-density of the underlying heater is increased in the location(s) where higher temperatures are desired on the wafer, and decreased in the location(s) where lower wafer temperatures are desired.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desired by chip manufacturers to have the ability to run different processes in the same process chamber. Capital equipment for growing films is very expensive (more than $1 million per process chamber is typical), so it is desired to maximize the usage of, and minimize the number of required process chambers. Different temperature processes with different chemistries are run in the same chamber to produce different films. These different films may also have different growth-rate vs. temperature behavior. This leads the chip manufacturers to desire the ability to change the watt-density map of a heater in a given process chamber “on-the-fly” to achieve the desired film thickness profile.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, it is desired by chip manufacturers to have the ability to run exactly the same “recipe” in multiple process chambers and produce films that have matching film thickness profiles (as well as other properties which can be affected by temperature such as film stress, refractive index, and others). Therefore, it is desired to have the ability to produce a heater which can have very repeatable watt-density maps from unit to unit.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">A heater can be made with the ability to change the watt-density map by using multiple independent heater circuits within the heater. By varying the voltages and currents applied to the different circuits, you can change the power levels in the locations of the individual circuits. The locations of these specific circuits are called “zones”. By increasing the voltage (and thereby the current as these heater elements are all resistance heaters) to a given zone, you increase the temperature in that zone. Conversely, when you decrease the voltage to a zone, you decrease the temperature in that zone. In this way, different watt-density maps can be produced by the same heater by changing the power to the individual zones.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">At least two limitations have affected chip makers' ability to effectively use multi-zone heaters. The first limitation is that current state-of-the-art heaters have only one control thermocouple. Only one control thermocouple can be used because the plate-and-shaft design currently used for heaters allows for location of a thermocouple at the center of the heater plate only, or within a radius of ˜1 inch of the center of the heater. Thermocouples are made of metals which are incompatible with the processing environment of the wafer, and therefore must be isolated from that environment. Additionally, for fastest response of a thermocouple (TC) it is best to have it operating in an atmospheric pressure environment, not the vacuum environment of a typical process chamber. Therefore, TCs can only be located within the central hollow area of the heater shaft which is not in communication with the process environment. If there are heater zones located outside of the 2 inch diameter of the heater shaft, then no TC can be installed there to monitor and help control the temperature of that zone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">This limitation has been addressed by using “slaved” power ratios to control heater zones located outside of the central area of the heater. Ratios are established of the power to be applied to the central zone and to each of the other zones which produce the desired watt-density map. The central control TC monitors the temperature of the central zone, and the power applied to the central zone (which is based on the feedback of the central control TC) is then applied to all zones as adjusted by the pre-established ratios. For example, with a two-zone heater, let us assume that a ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 of power applied to the outer and inner zones produces the desired temperature profile. Let us assume that the heater control system, by reading the temperature data provided by the central control TC, determines that a voltage of 100 VAC is needed to achieve the proper temperature. With the slaved ratio control methodology, a voltage of 120 VAC will thereby be applied to the outer heater zone, and a voltage of 100 VAC will be applied to the inner zone. The watt-density map can thereby be adjusted by changing the slave ratios.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">This leads us to the second limitation. Current state-of-the-art heaters have an inherent variation of the resistance of the embedded heater(s). Due to the high temperatures and pressures required in the manufacturing process of current ceramic heaters, the resistance tolerance achievable can approach 50%. In other words, a typical resistance for a semiconductor-grade ceramic heater element is within a range of 1.8-3.0 ohms (at room temperature—the heater element material is typically molybdenum, which increases in resistance as the operating temperature increases).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">This variation causes a problem with maintaining a repeatable watt-density-map from unit to unit with multi-zone heaters controlled by the slave-ratio method. With single zone heaters, the resistance variation may not be an issue, because a control TC is utilized to monitor the actual operating temperature, and power levels fed to the heater are adjusted accordingly. But if you have a multi-zone heater, and the heater element resistance variations can approach 50%, then the slave ratio control methodology will not produce a repeatable watt density map from unit to unit.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">What is called for is to establish a heater design which will allow installation of multiple control TCs which can be physically located within the respective heater zones to allow for feedback and control directly, and yet still keep the TCs isolated from the processing environment within the process chamber.</div>

The plate <b>102</b> has a top surface <b>103</b>. The shaft <b>101</b> may be a hollow cylinder. The plate <b>102</b> may be a flat disc. Other subcomponents may be present. In some present processes, the plate <b>102</b> may be manufactured individually in an initial process involving a process oven wherein the ceramic plate is formed. In some embodiments, the plate may be joined to the shaft with a low temperature hermetic joining process as described below.</div>

A joining material, such as brazing layer <b>190</b>, may be included, which can be selected from the combinations of braze layer materials described herein and may be delivered to the joint according to the methods described herein. In some aspects, the plate may be aluminum nitride and the shaft may be aluminum nitride, zirconia, alumina, or other ceramic. In some aspects, it may be desired to use a shaft material with a lower conductive thermal transfer coefficient in some embodiments.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to the joint depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shaft <b>191</b> may be positioned such that it abuts the plate, with only the brazing layer interposed between the surfaces to be joined, for example surface <b>193</b> of the shaft and surface <b>194</b> of the plate. The interface surface <b>194</b> of the plate <b>192</b> may reside in a recess <b>195</b> in the plate. The thickness of the joint is exaggerated for clarity of illustration. In an exemplary embodiment, the plate and shaft may both be of aluminum nitride and both have been separately formed previously using a liquid phase sintering process. The plate may be approximately 9-13 inches in diameter and 0.5 to 0.75 inches thick in some embodiments. The shaft may be a hollow cylinder which is 5-10 inches long with a wall thickness in the 0.1 inches and an exterior diameter in the range 1-3 inches. The plate may have a recess adapted to receive an outer surface of a first end of the shaft.</div>

On an external surface <b>207</b> of the semiconductor processing equipment, such as a heater <b>205</b>, the brazing material must be compatible with the processes occurring in, and the environment <b>201</b> present in, the semiconductor processing chamber <b>200</b> in which the heater <b>205</b> will be used. The environment <b>201</b> present in the processing chamber <b>200</b> may include fluorine chemistries. The heater <b>205</b> may have a substrate <b>206</b> affixed to a top surface of the plate <b>203</b>, which is supported by a shaft <b>204</b>. On an internal surface <b>208</b> of the heater <b>205</b>, the brazing layer material must be compatible with a different atmosphere <b>202</b>, which may be an oxygenated atmosphere. Prior brazing materials used with ceramics have not been able to meet both of these criteria. For example, braze elements containing copper, silver, or gold may interfere with the lattice structure of the silicon wafer being processed, and are thus not appropriate. However, in the case of a brazed joint joining a heater plate to a heater shaft, the interior of the shaft typically sees a high temperature, and has an oxygenated atmosphere within the center of a the hollow shaft. The portion of the braze joint which would be exposed to this atmosphere will oxidize, and may oxidize into the joint, resulting in a failure of the hermeticity of the joint. In addition to structural attachment, the joint between the shaft and the plate of these devices to be used in semiconductor manufacturing must be hermetic in many, if not most or all, uses.</div>

The use of a radial feeder, such as the covered hollow area, allows individual control thermocouples to be used to directly monitor the local temperature at each heater zone of a multi-zone heater. Thermocouples <b>505</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>507</b> may be installed within thermocouple wells <b>508</b>, <b>509</b>, <b>510</b> located at each individual heater zone. The thermocouples may be installed into these wells which are located within the covered hollow area, or channel. In some embodiments, machining of the plate may be performed in the channel to allow for deeper installation of the thermocouple. The thermocouples may then be covered with a ceramic cover plate <b>501</b> positioned on the heater plate backside and between the heater plate and shaft. The heater plate, hollow area cover plate, and heater shaft are then bonded together. This isolates the thermocouples from the process environment, and provides direct feedback of the temperature of each heater zone for traditional control. In some heater designs, the heater is fully embedded within the plate during the manufacturing process of the plate. This processing may entail high temperature, which may be in the range of 1700 C, and high pressing contact force during the formation of the plate. Although the heater element itself may be adapted to withstand this processing, thermocouples and the leads into the thermocouples, which may be made of Inconel, are not able to withstand this processing. With installation of thermocouples after the final sintering and pressing of the ceramic plate, the thermocouples must then be protected from the process chemistries which the heater will be exposed to during its use. The use of multiple thermocouples to monitor the temperature of areas of the plate which have separate heaters allows for temperature control of these areas of the plate based upon actual temperature readings.</div>

Aluminum has a property of forming a self-limiting layer of oxidized aluminum. This layer is generally homogenous, and, once formed, prevents or significantly limits additional oxygen or other oxidizing chemistries (such a fluorine chemistries) penetrating to the base aluminum and continuing the oxidation process. In this way, there is an initial brief period of oxidation or corrosion of the aluminum, which is then substantially stopped or slowed by the oxide (or fluoride) layer which has been formed on the surface of the aluminum. The braze material may be in the form of a sheet, a powder, a thin film, or be of any other form factor suitable for the brazing processes described herein. For example, the brazing layer may be a sheet having a thickness ranging from 0.00019 inches to 0.011 inches or more. In some embodiments, the braze material may be a sheet having a thickness of approximately 0.0012 inches. In some embodiments, the braze material may be a sheet having a thickness of approximately 0.006 inches. Typically, alloying constituents (such as magnesium, for example) in aluminum are formed as precipitates in between the grain boundaries of the aluminum. While they can reduce the oxidation resistance of the aluminum bonding layer, typically these precipitates do not form contiguous pathways through the aluminum, and thereby do not allow penetration of the oxidizing agents through the full aluminum layer, and thus leaving intact the self-limiting oxide-layer characteristic of aluminum which provides its corrosion resistance. In the embodiments of using an aluminum alloy which contains constituents which can form precipitates, process parameters, including cooling protocols, would be adapted to minimize the precipitates in the grain boundary. For example, in one embodiment, the braze material may be aluminum having a purity of at least 99.5%.

As the brazing layer temperature reaches and exceeds the liquidus temperature, pressure across the brazing layer between the pieces being joined will cause relative motion between the pieces until the mesas on a first piece contact an interface surface on a second piece. At that point, contact pressure across the joint will no longer be supplied by the external force (except as resistance to repulsive forces within the brazing layer, if any). The mesas may prevent the brazing layer from being forced out of the joint area prior to the full wetting of ceramic pieces, and may thus allow better and/or full wetting during the joining process. In some embodiments, mesas are not used.</div>

In some embodiments, the fixtured assembly is placed within a zirconium inner chamber which acts as an oxygen attractant, further reducing the residual oxygen which might have found its way towards the joint during processing.

As voids form in the joining layer, the hermeticity of the joint may be lost. The process temperature and the time duration of the process temperature may be controlled such that the aluminum layer does not evaporate away, and so that a hermetic joint is achieved. With proper temperature and process time duration control, in addition to the other process parameters described above, a continuous joint may be formed.

For example, a post or shaft may be placed into a countersunk hole or recess in a mating piece. The countersink may be larger than the exterior dimension of the post or shaft. This may create an area around the post or shaft which then may be filled with aluminum, or an aluminum alloy. In this scenario, pressure placed between the two pieces in order to hold them during joining may not result in any pressure across the braze layer. Also, it may be possible to hold each piece in the preferred end position using fixturing such that little or no pressure is placed between the pieces at all.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0082]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0083" num="0082">Joined assemblies joined as described above result in pieces with hermetic sealing between the joined pieces. Such assemblies are then able to be used where atmosphere isolation is an important aspect in the use of the assemblies. Further, the portion of the joint which may be exposed to various atmospheres when the joined assemblies are later used in semi-conductor processing, for example, will not degrade in such atmospheres, nor will it contaminate the later semi-conductor processing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0083]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0084" num="0083">Both hermetic and non-hermetic joints may join pieces strongly, in that significant force is needed to separate the pieces. However, the fact that a joint is strong is not determinative of whether the joint provides a hermetic seal. The ability to obtain hermetic joints may be related to the wetting of the joint. Wetting describes the ability or tendency of a liquid to spread over the surface of another material. If there is insufficient wetting in a brazed joint, there will be areas where there is no bonding. If there is enough non-wetted area, then gas may pass through the joint, causing a leak. Wetting may be affected by the pressure across the joint at different stages in the melting of the brazing material. The use of mesa standoffs, or other standoff device such as the insertion of ceramic spheres or powder particles of appropriate diameter, to limit the compression of the brazing layer beyond a certain minimum distance may enhance the wetting of the areas of the joint. Careful control of the atmosphere seen by the brazing element during the joining process may enhance the wetting of the areas of the joint. In combination, careful control of the joint thickness, and careful control of the atmosphere used during the process, may result in a complete wetting of the joint interface area that is not able to be achieved with other processes. Further, the use of a brazing layer that is of a proper thickness, which may be thicker than the mesa standoff height, in conjunction with the other referenced factors, may result in a very well wetted, hermetic, joint. Although a variety of joining layer thicknesses may be successful, an increased thickness of the joining layer may enhance the success rate of the joint's hermetic aspect.</div>

Without full wetting, non-wetted areas are introduced into the final joint, in the joint interface area. When sufficient contiguous non-wetted areas are introduced, the hermeticity of the joint is lost.</div>

Similarly, the presence of oxygen may lead to the oxygen reacting with the molten aluminum to form aluminum oxide, and this reaction formation may interfere with the wetting of the joint interface area. Using a vacuum atmosphere of pressure lower than 5×10-5 Torr has been shown to have removed enough oxygen and nitrogen to allow for fully robust wetting of the joint interface area, and hermetic joints. In some embodiments, use of higher pressures, including atmospheric pressure, but using non-oxidizing gasses such as hydrogen or pure noble gasses such as argon, for example, in the process chamber during the brazing step has also led to robust wetting of the joint interface area, and hermetic joints. In order to avoid the oxygen reaction referred to above, the amount of oxygen in the process chamber during the brazing process must be low enough such that the full wetting of the joint interface area is not adversely affected. In order to avoid the nitrogen reaction referred to above, the amount of nitrogen present in the process chamber during the brazing process must be low enough such that the full wetting of joint interface area is not adversely affected.</div>
