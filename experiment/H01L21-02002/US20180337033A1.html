When the semiconductor device <b>200</b> is a logic device, the logic device can include a NAND2 type, a NOR2 type, or an inverter type of logic device. For instance, at least one isolation gate <b>202</b> may be disposed above a trench <b>204</b>, the trench <b>204</b> extending into a substrate <b>206</b>, the substrate <b>206</b> can include silicon or any other substrate material.</div>

For example, the SOI substrate may include an isolation layer (not shown), which may be a local buried oxide region (BOX) or any suitable material for electrically isolating transistors, aligned with the gate structure. In some embodiments, the device is a portion of a back end of line (BEOL) portion of an integrated circuit (IC).</div>

The epitaxial growths <b>210</b> can include SiGe, SiP, or similar materials epitaxially grown in cavities previously formed between the gates. The shape of epitaxial growths <b>210</b> is largely dependent upon the shape and size of the at least one isolation gate <b>202</b>. For instance, in the current state of technology, a width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate <b>202</b> will be the same as a width <b>214</b> of the at least one gate structure <b>208</b>. The width <b>214</b> of the at last one gate structure <b>208</b> is determined by the size of the device. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, when width <b>212</b> and width <b>214</b> are equal, the set of epitaxial growths <b>210</b> are tapered and make poor contact with an oxide layer <b>216</b> disposed between the at least one isolation gate <b>202</b> and the trench <b>204</b>, the oxide layer <b>216</b> typically being approximately as wide as the at least one isolation gate <b>202</b>. This results in poor isolation and increased leakage current of the device <b>200</b>. Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, if the width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate <b>202</b> is reduced relative to the width <b>214</b> of the at least one gate structure <b>208</b>, the taper of the epitaxial growths <b>210</b> becomes more dramatic, increasing the gaps and decreasing contact with the oxide layer <b>216</b>. However, according to embodiments of the current invention, turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, if the width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate <b>202</b> is increased relative to the width <b>214</b> of the gate structures <b>208</b>, the taper can be reduced or eliminated, resulting in little to no gap between the epitaxial growths <b>210</b> and the oxide layer <b>216</b>, causing a conformal or near conformal structure which contacts at least a portion of a bottom surface of the oxide layer <b>216</b> and at least a portion of a side surface of the oxide layer <b>216</b>.</div>

However, this is only illustrative, as width <b>214</b> may be less than 20 nm, for instance 17 nm or 14 nm. The width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate may be 2-3 nm wider than width <b>214</b> in some embodiments. In another embodiment, the width <b>212</b> may be 2-3 nm wider than width <b>214</b> on each side of the isolation gate <b>202</b>, for a total of 4-6 nm wider than the gate structures <b>208</b>. The width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate <b>202</b> determines the cavity shape when etched, and thus the shape of the epitaxial growth <b>210</b>. Widening the isolation gate <b>202</b> relative to the gate structures <b>208</b> can improve the shape of epitaxial growths <b>210</b> without affecting other device performance, other than improving the drive current and leakage current.</div>

The numbers on the graph are arbitrary units for illustration purposes only, and are not intended to be limiting in any way. With a width <b>212</b> of the isolation gate <b>202</b> varying for a width <b>114</b> of gate structure <b>208</b> being 20 nm, the 16 nm width has very poor performance, and the 20 nm width has poor performance. However, by widening the isolation gate <b>202</b> to 28 nm, the performance sees a significant increase, with the leakage current dropping significantly relative to the drive current. Although a 28 nm isolation gate is used for the results, the isolation gate could be from 21 nm to 30 nm wide, rather than 28 nm. While results are shown for a 20 nm gate structure, similar results are obtained for a gate structure of smaller sizes, for instance 17 nm and 14 nm. In these embodiments, the isolation gate could be between 1 nm wider than the gate structure up to 8 nm wider than the gate structure.</div>
