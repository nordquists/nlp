<div class="abstract">A silicon carbide (SiC) wafer and a positioning-edge processing method thereof are provided. The SiC wafer has a first flat and a second flat. A first rounded corner is respectively disposed at a connection between two ends of the first flat and an edge of the SiC wafer, wherein the first rounded corner has a radius of 1-10 mm. A second rounded corner is respectively disposed at a connection between two ends of the second flat and the edge of the SiC wafer, wherein the second rounded corner has a radius of 1-10 mm. Since the rounded corners at the connections between two ends of the flats and the wafer edges have optimum radii, the yield and quality of the wafer processing may be improved.</div>
