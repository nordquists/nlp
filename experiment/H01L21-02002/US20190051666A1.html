<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices fabricated using semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) technologies may exhibit certain performance improvements in comparison with comparable devices built directly in a bulk silicon substrate. Generally, an SOI wafer includes a thin device layer of semiconductor material, a handle substrate, and a thin buried insulator layer, such as a buried oxide or BOX layer, physically separating and electrically isolating the device layer from the handle substrate. Integrated circuits are fabricated using the semiconductor material of the device layer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In semiconductor devices fabricated using SOI technology, it is sometimes necessary to process the backside of the wafer (backside processes) to further produce other circuit elements such as passive components comprising inductors or capacitors. Therefore, there is a need to form a conductive contact structure (body contact) in the wafer that can be electrically coupled to the backside of the wafer. Typically, to protect the conductive contact structure against the etchant such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) during the fabrication of the conductive contact structure an insulating liner is required to cover the conductive contact structure. The disadvantage of this practice is that the conductive contact structure with the insulating liner leads to apparent induced charge effect.</div>
