<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of semiconductor device fabrication and semiconductor manufacturing operations, many individual integrated circuits (ICs) are formed on a wafer substrate (typically mono-crystalline silicon). During various steps of the semiconductor fabrication process, various process steps including deposition, removal, patterning, and modification of electrical properties (e.g., doping) are applied to the wafer in order to generate the ICs. Each IC is formed in a particular section of the wafer, and a block of semiconducting material corresponding to one IC is commonly referred to as a die. Many wafers may undergo the fabrication process simultaneously and/or concurrently (e.g., in parallel or in a pipelined process).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The integrated circuits of the dies on a wafer are typically subjected to testing after the completion of the fabrication process. A wafer prober may be used test the functionality and performance of each die on the wafer, such as by supplying known input waveforms (test patterns) to the dies and measuring the output waveforms generated by the ICs of the dies. The dies are then classified (or “binned”) based on the measured performance. Examples of classifications include “good,” “open circuit,” “short circuit” or finer grained classifications such as impedance, clock speed, or partial failures of particular portions of the die (e.g., one or more non-functional cores of a multi-core processor or failed portions of cache memory). The resulting classifications are commonly represented on a color-coded or shaded grid, where each location on the grid corresponds to a different die, and the color (or shade) identifies how the die at the location has been classified (or binned). After the wafer is tested, the wafer is scored and then broken into the individual dies (referred to as wafer dicing), and the dies containing integrated circuits that are known to be good are packaged (e.g., encapsulated into a supporting plastic or ceramic case). The yield of a semiconductor manufacturing process may refer to the percentage of dies that have good (functioning) integrated circuits.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following detailed description, only certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown and described, by way of illustration.

Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">Aspects of embodiments of the present invention relate to generating full wafer maps of predicted classifications of all of the dies on the wafer by sampling only a subset of the dies of the wafer. By sampling only a subset of the dies, the time spent testing the individual dies of the wafer is reduced, thereby shortening turn-around times (TAT) for generating the wafer maps, allowing for earlier detection of problems in the semiconductor fabrication process and adjustment of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment to resolve those problems. This, in turn, reduces the fraction of non-functional integrated circuits in the wafers produced by the semiconductor fabrication process and increases yields, thereby reducing waste and increasing efficiency.</div>

The resulting measurements may be used to reconfigure the process (run-to-run control <b>50</b>) to adjust for process drift (e.g., variations in the attributes of the manufactured semiconductor devices over time, e.g., from wafer to wafer).</div>

Virtual metrology refers to the prediction of metrology variables (either measureable or non-measurable) using process data (from the fault detection and classification system) or partial metrology data (e.g., from various steps of the process, such as “Step-N” of the process). Because virtual metrology is capable of shorter turn-around-times, than conventional metrology techniques, feedback can be provided to the run-to-run control system more frequently, thereby reducing the amount of process variation, as shown by the line labeled “VM-guided control” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, aspects of embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for generating virtual metrology data. Aspects of embodiments of the present invention include: generating a full reconstructed wafer map of characteristics of all of the dies of a wafer using only sparse samples collected from selected dies of the wafer (e.g., collected by using the wafer prober to test a sparse sampling of the dies of the wafer); computing a set of sampling points (a probe mask) to be used for all wafers of a wafer set (e.g., a set of wafers that are expected to exhibit correlated characteristics); and identifying hidden variables among the multiple process steps to enable earlier and more reliable detection of process drift or other problems. The generation of the full wafer map from the sparse samples may be referred to herein as a “reconstruction” of the wafer map, and the identification and computation of the hidden variables may be referred to as “indexing” a wafer and computing a “feature map” for the wafer. Implementing techniques according to embodiments of the present invention improves the quality of control over the semiconductor manufacturing process, thereby improving yields.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0050">Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique for efficient reconstruction of a signal by finding solutions to underdetermined linear systems. In some circumstances, compressed sensing allows for accurate reconstruction of signals from samples obtained below (or less than) the Nyquist rate. The general procedure for compressed sensing involves identifying a transform domain in which the signal is sparse and solving the sparse regression problem with the L<sub>0 </sub>or L<sub>1 </sub>norm as a regularized term. Specific examples of compressed sensing techniques include the “basis pursuit” approach using a Primal-Dual interior point method, a “matching pursuit” (see, e.g., J. Tropp and A. C. Gilbert, “Signal recovery from partial information via orthogonal matching pursuit,”IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 53, no. 12, pp. 4655-4666, 2007.), and convex optimization, also known as LASSO (see, e.g., R. Tibshirani, “Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso,” J. Roy. Stat. Soc. Ser. B, vol. 58, no. 1, pp. 267-288, 1996.). Also, see, generally, J. Romberg, “Compressed Sensing: A Tutorial,” IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop, (2007) and Candès, Emmanuel J., and Michael B. Wakin. “An introduction to compressive sampling.” <i>IEEE signal processing magazine </i>25.2 (2008):21-30.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0051]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0052" num="0051">Variability within semiconductor wafers generally takes on a radial shape. This may be due to the practice of rotating of the wafer during processing to increase process uniformity. In chemical vapor deposition (CVD), species depletion, temperature non-uniformity are affected by wafer boundary conditions (see, e.g., J. Sali, “Hot-wire CVD growth simulation for thickness uniformity,” Proc. Int. Conf. Cat-CVD Process, 2001.) In physical vapor deposition (PVD) and etching steps, re-deposition effects and the distribution of the radio frequency electric field can also cause radially-shaped variability (see, e.g., T. W. Kim, “Investigation of etch rate uniformity of 60 MHz plasma etching equipment,” JJAP, 2001 &amp; J. Electrochem. 2003.) Furthermore, the temperature of the wafer is generally higher at its center (see, e.g., Q. Zhang, “One step forward from run-to-run critical dimension control: Across-wafer level critical dimension control through lithography and etch process,” J. Process Control, 2008.). Other sources of variability having radially shaped characteristics include photoresist coating and wafer deformation. (Other, non-radially shaped variability can also arise from factors such as random dopant fluctuations, line-edge roughness, and the like.)</div>
