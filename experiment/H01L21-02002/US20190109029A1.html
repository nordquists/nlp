<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The fabrication of advanced integrated circuits, such as CPU's, storage devices, ASIC's (application specific integrated circuits) and the like, requires the formation of a large number of circuit elements in a given chip area according to a specified circuit layout, wherein so-called metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs or FETs) represent one important type of circuit element that substantially determines performance of the integrated circuits. A FET is a device that typically includes a source region, a drain region, a channel region that is positioned between the source region and the drain region, and a gate electrode positioned above the channel region.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In manufacturing FETs, whether planer FETs or finFETs, deposition of materials is an important part of such manufacturing process. More recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes have been increasingly used to deposit met aerial onto semiconductor substrates. ALD processes are essentially a monolayer rate deposition processes. That is, a film is grown in stages, wherein each reactant type is pulsed onto a semiconductor wafer surface. Each of the reactant types are separated by a purge gas. Unlike previous deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), ALD techniques calls for each of the reactant types to chemically react with the surface of the wafer. Since this techniques is a monolayer process, the precision of the control of ALD processes is important.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">As an etching process analog to ALD processes, designers have implemented atomic layer etching (ALE) processes. ALE processes have been increasingly replacing previous etching processes. ALE calls for a chemical precursor that is introduced upon the surface of the wafer. The chemical reactants are then removed from the process chamber. Subsequently, an energy source, such as low energy ion beams are introduced to induce a chemical reaction between the absorbed chemical and the wafer substrate. A thickness loss of a monolayer is experienced per cycle to perform the ALE process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Some of the problems associated with the state of the art include the fact that ALD and ALE precursor gas dosage generally degrade over time. This may occur as a result of process disturbances, process drift, chemical level-changes in a vessel or chamber, etc. As a result, the dosage applied to one semiconductor wafer in a wafer-run or a wafer-lot may vary from the dosage applied to another wafer in that run/lot. This could lead to non-uniform deposition or etching results. Thus, layer thickness may vary from wafer to wafer when a run/lot of wafers are being processed. The problems with the state of the art may cause various defects, such as non-uniformity in wafer quality or performance, parasitic capacitance, non-uniform threshold voltages, etc.</div>
