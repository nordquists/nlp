</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, processing apparatuses are used to perform various types of processing on processing target objects (for example, a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer or various types of films formed on a surface of a substrate). There is raised as an example of such a processing apparatus a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus for polishing a processing target object. In a general CMP, a processing target object is pressed against a polishing pad, and the processing target object and the polishing pad are moved relatively while a polishing agent (a slurry) is supplied between the processing target object and the polishing pad to thereby polish a surface of the processing target object.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known that a removal rate of a CMP apparatus follows Preston's Law, and a removal rate is proportional to a polishing pressure. When a surface of a substrate, which constitutes a polishing target object, is uneven, since a contact pressure against a polishing pad becomes greater at a protruded portion than at a recessed portion, the removal rate becomes faster at the protruded portion than at the recessed portion. In the CMP apparatus, a step on the surface of the substrate is eliminated by use of the difference in removal rate between the protruded portion and the recessed portion to thereby realize the planarization of the substrate surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, chips of various designs are formed on a surface of a substrate before it is planarized using the CMP apparatus, and these chips include steps of various heights caused by pattern structure and film forming method, and dimensions of the steps (specifically, width and surface area of protruded portions) vary widely. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates sectional views of CMP process which planarizes a substrate including wiring portions and Cu layer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a state where a barrier metal <b>53</b> is deposited by use of a PVD, CVD, or ALD on a substrate WF in which wiring grooves <b>52</b> are formed on an insulation film <b>51</b>, a Cu seed film is further deposited on an upper layer of the barrier metal <b>53</b> by use of a PVD method or the like, and thereafter, a Cu layer <b>54</b> is plated by use of an electro plating method or the like. In a normal CMP process, an excessive Cu layer <b>54</b> on the barrier metal <b>53</b> that is located at portions other than the wiring portions is polished away in a first process, for example. Further, although not illustrated, in a second process, the barrier metal <b>53</b> is polished away and the insulation film <b>51</b> that lies underneath the barrier metal <b>53</b> is slightly polished away, whereby Cu is allowed to remain only at the wiring portions. This completes the process of embedding Cu in the wiring portions. Here, as illustrated, steps are formed on a surface of the Cu layer <b>54</b> due to the wiring structures (wiring widths and densities) lying underneath the formed Cu layer <b>54</b> and the electro plating film forming conditions. Especially, at a potion where narrow wiring grooves are formed densely, large size of step height (a left-hand side's protruded portion in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) can be formed in electroplating. Then, when the surface of the substrate having the steps of various dimensions is polished using CMP, a polishing pressure exerted on recessed portions and protruded portions of the steps differs depending upon the height, width and area of the steps. This is because a difference in pressures exerted on the protruded portions and recessed portions of the steps is caused to differ by the elasticity of the polishing pad which contacts the protruded portions and the recessed portions of the steps. In Detail, at a step which has low step height or a large width or surface area, a difference in removal rate between the protruded portion and the recessed portion of the step becomes smaller, and the speed of step height reduction with respect to the polishing amount becomes smaller, too. Due to this, the Cu layer <b>54</b> tends to remain more at a portion where the speed of step height reduction is slower than at other portions (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) at the time the barrier metal <b>53</b> starts to expose. In these situations, in the event that the Cu layer <b>54</b> remains between wirings, this should cause a short circuit between these wirings, and in the event that the Cu layer remains on a portion other than the portion between the wirings, another step should be newly formed when a film is formed over such a portion. Thus, the remaining Cu layer <b>54</b> needs to be removed completely, and to make this happen, an excessive polishing is carried out intentionally. As a result of this intentional excessive polishing, however, not only Cu is polished away excessively, but also the barrier metal <b>53</b> between the wirings or even the insulation film <b>51</b> lying underneath the barrier metal <b>53</b> is polished away at the wiring portions where a little or no excessive Cu remains. This causes dishing or erosion at the wiring portions after CMP is completed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). The dishing and erosion affect largely to the variation in sectional area of the wirings and the performance of a device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Although what has been described above is the example of the embedding process of the Cu wiring by use of CMP, in planarizing processes using the other methods, too, steps of various dimensions exist which are caused due to pattern structures within a chip or film forming methods at prior film forming stages, and the difference in dimension of the steps causes an uneven planarization performance. Thus, it has been desired that an even planarization performance is realized irrespective of a difference in dimension of steps.</div>

Here, the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> is formed, for example, of a hard pad of an expanded poly urethane system, a soft pad of a suede system, or sponge. A type of the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> should be selected as required according to a material a target processing surface of the substrate WF or type of roughening particles. For example, in a case where a target processing surface of the substrate WF is made of a material of a small mechanical strength such as a Cu or Low-k film or the hardness of roughening particles described later is great, in roughening the target processing surface, since the target processing surface may be roughened more than required, a pad of a low hardness or rigidity may be selected. On the other hand, when a projecting portion on the surface of the substrate WF is roughened for preference, a contact of the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> with the substrate WF needs to be controlled. To make this happen, it is preferable to have a wide selectivity of a contact pressure at which the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> contacts uneven portions on a surface of a removal material of the substrate WF. For example, in a case where only protruded portions of uneven portions existing on the initial target processing surface of the substrate WF are attempted to be roughened selectively, a roughening pad of a high hardness or rigidity may be selected as the surface roughening pad <b>104</b>. Additionally, the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> may be made up of a structure in which multiple pads are stacked on one another. For example, the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> may adopt a two-layer structure in which a surface which is brought into contact with the target processing surface of the substrate WF is made up of a pad of a high hardness or rigidity, while a lower layer is made up of a pad of a low hardness or rigidity.

A type of roughening particles can contain at least one of, for example, diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN), silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), and aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Roughening particles can have a particle size in the range from 100 nm to about several hundreds of nanometers. For example, a large step height of the order of 100 nm may exist on a surface of a substrate WF before it is polished through CMP. In this case, the surface of the substrate WF is desirably surface roughened to an unevenness of a height of 10 nm to several tens of nanometers. Roughening particles whose size falls in the range of particle sizes described above are desirably used so that an unevenness formed on the surface of the substrate WF when it is surface roughened is not polished away to such a depth that a wiring structure of the substrate is reached. In addition, when a substrate WF having small initial steps is surface roughened, the substrate WF is desirably surface roughened so that an unevenness formed on the surface of the substrate WF is reduced to 10 nm or smaller. In this case, roughening particles having a particle size in the range from 10 nm to several tens of nanometers should desirably be used. The concentration of roughening particles then should be less than 10 wt % and be preferably less than 1 wt %. This is because when the concentration of roughening particles becomes great, although the surface roughening speed becomes faster, whereas the target processing surface of the substrate WF itself is polished away. A pure water (DIW: De-Ionized Water) may be used as a liquid in which roughening particles are suspended; however, a pH control using a pH control agent may be performed as required depending on the property of the target processing surface of the substrate WF. For roughening particles having a high agglomeration property such as CeO<sub>2</sub>, for example, the agglomeration of roughening particles may be suppressed by adding a dispersant. When surface roughening only protruded portions of steps existing initially on the target processing surface of the substrate WF selectively, to protect recessed portions, a protective component may be added. This enables the selectivity of protruded portions on a step to be controlled when surface roughening such protruded portions.</div>

A cushion material may be provided on a substrate WF fixing surface of the table <b>132</b>. Due to this, the substrate WF is directly sucked via the table <b>132</b>, whereas the substrate WF is sucked via the cushion material. The cushion material is formed of an elastic material such as, for example, polyurethane, nylon, fluororubber, silicone rubber and the like and is tightly secured to the table <b>132</b> via a viscous resin layer. Since the cushion material has elasticity, the cushion material not only prevents the wafer from being damaged but also mitigates the influence on the surface roughening of unevenness on the surface of the table <b>132</b> on the surface roughening.</div>

The surface roughening head <b>134</b> is coupled to a rotatable shaft <b>136</b>. The shaft <b>136</b> can be rotated together with the surface roughening head <b>134</b> by a drive mechanism, not illustrated. A surface roughening pad <b>138</b> is attached to a lower surface of the surface roughening head <b>134</b>. The shaft <b>136</b> is connected to an oscillating arm <b>109</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> is smaller in dimension than a substrate WF which constitutes a processing target. For example, with a diameter ϕ of the substrate WF being 300 mm, a diameter ϕ of the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> is preferably 100 mm or smaller and is more preferably in the range from 60 to 100 mm. Since an area ratio with the substrate WF becomes smaller as the diameter of the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> becomes larger, a processing speed at which the substrate WF is processed is increased. On the contrary, uniformity of processing speeds within a target processing surface of the substrate WF is processed or roughened becomes better as the diameter of the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> becomes smaller. This is because a unit processing area becomes smaller, and as will be described later, this becomes advantageous in a form in which an overall surface of the substrate WF is processed or roughened by moving or oscillating relatively the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> within a plane of the substrate WF by the arm <b>109</b>. The surface roughening head <b>134</b> is configured to move in a direction normal to the surface of the substrate WF on the table <b>132</b>, whereby the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> can be pressed against the substrate WF at a predetermined pressure. Here, as a form of forcing the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> against the substrate WF, a form may be adopted in which the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> is pressed against the substrate WF by use of an air cylinder, a ball screw or the like. Alternatively, a form may be adopted in which although not illustrated, an air bag is disposed inside the surface roughening head <b>134</b>, and air corresponding to a contact pressure is supplied into the air bag after the surface roughening head <b>134</b> is caused to approach the substrate WF, whereby the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> is pressed against the substrate WF. The air bag may be divided into multiple regions, and pressures at the divided regions may be controlled. The surface roughening head <b>134</b> is configured to move within the plane of the table <b>132</b>, for example, in a radial direction of the table <b>132</b> by the arm <b>109</b>. Here, as to a moving speed at which the surface roughening head <b>134</b> is moved by the arm <b>109</b>, since an optimal moving speed distribution differs depending on rotational speeds of the substrate WF and the surface roughening head <b>134</b> and a moving distance of the surface roughening head <b>134</b>, and therefore, it is desirable that the moving speed of the surface roughening head <b>134</b> can be changed within the plane of the substrate WF. As this occurs, as a form of changing the moving speed, for example, a form is desirable in which for example, an oscillating distance within the plane of the substrate WF is divided in a plurality of sections, and a moving speed can be set for each of the divided sections. The surface roughening unit <b>100</b> includes a roughening particle supply nozzle <b>110</b> as in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The surface roughening unit <b>100</b> can roughen the substrate WF by not only supplying a liquid containing roughening particles to the substrate WF but also forcing the surface roughening head <b>134</b> against the substrate WF and moving the surface roughening head <b>134</b> within the plane of the table <b>132</b> while rotating the table <b>132</b> and the surface roughening head <b>134</b> individually. The surface roughening pad <b>138</b> may be similar to the surface roughening pad <b>104</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> excluding the dimension of the surface roughening pad <b>138</b>. The surface roughening unit <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes further a cleaning liquid supply nozzle <b>111</b> configured to supply a cleaning liquid onto the substrate WF. The cleaning liquid can be made up of pure water and/or a chemical.

By using this form, even when the surface roughening head <b>134</b> oscillates within the plane of the substrate WF, the liquid containing roughening particles can efficiently be supplied to a contact plane between the surface roughening pad <b>138</b> and the substrate WF.</div>

In the surface roughening unit <b>100</b> according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, no surface roughening pad is used. In the surface roughening unit <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b> configured to supply a liquid containing roughening particles to a surface or a target processing surface of the substrate WF under a high pressure condition and attached to an arm <b>109</b> configured to oscillate parallel to the surface of the substrate WF. The high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b> is connected to a roughening particle supply tank <b>116</b>. The roughening particle supply tank <b>116</b> is connected to a compressor <b>117</b>, a regulator <b>119</b> and the like, whereby a liquid containing roughening particles can be sprayed from the high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b> to the surface of the substrate WF via a pressure gauge <b>121</b> under a pressure of, for example, 1 kgf/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 10 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>. Here, sizes, types and concentrations of roughening particles can be selected based on initial step height on a removal target layer of the substrate WF and a thickness and type of the layer. A type of roughening particles can contain at least one of, for example, diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN), silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), and aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Roughening particles can have a particle size in the range from 100 nm to about several hundreds of nanometers. For example, a large step height of the order of 100 nm may exist on a surface of a substrate WF before it is polished through CMP. In this case, the surface of the substrate WF is desirably surface roughened to an unevenness of an order of about 10 nm to several tens of nanometers. Roughening particles whose size falls in the range of particle sizes described above are desirably used so that an unevenness formed on the surface of the substrate WF when it is surface roughened is not polished away to such a depth that a wiring structure of the substrate is reached. In addition, when a substrate WF having small initial step height is surface roughened, the substrate WF is desirably surface roughened so that an unevenness formed on the surface of the substrate WF is reduced to 10 nm or smaller. In this case, roughening particles having a particle size in the range from 10 nm to several tens of nanometers should desirably be used. A DIW may be used as a liquid in which roughening particles are suspended; however, a pH control using a pH control agent may be performed as required depending on the property of the target processing surface of the substrate WF. For roughening particles having a high agglomeration property such as CeO<sub>2</sub>, for example, the agglomeration of roughening particles may be suppressed by adding a dispersant. When surface roughening only protruded portions of uneven portions existing initially on the target processing surface of the substrate WF selectively, to protect recessed portions, a protective component may be added. This enables the selectivity of protruded portions on an uneven portion to be controlled when surface roughening such protruded portions. For moving speed at which the high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b> by the arm <b>109</b>, since an optimal distribution of moving speeds differs depending on the rotational speed of the substrate WF or the moving distance of the high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b>, it is desirable that the moving speed of the high-pressure supply nozzle <b>115</b> within the plane of the substrate WF is variable. In this case, as a form of changing the moving speed, a form is desirably adopted in which the oscillating distance within the plane of the substrate WF is dived into a plurality of sections, so that a moving speed can be set for each of the divided sections.

A case is taken into consideration in which a target processing surface of a substrate WF which is in a state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> is planarized. In this embodiment, firstly, the surface of the substrate WF is roughened (S<b>102</b>). The target processing surface of the substrate WF can be roughened by use of an arbitrary one of the surface roughening units <b>100</b> which have been described heretofore. The roughening of the surface of the substrate WF is intended to reduce a dimension of a large protruded portion formed on the surface of the substrate WF, and therefore, the protruded portion formed on the surface of the substrate WF is preferably roughened for preference. A height of an unevenness formed on the roughened surface of the substrate WF can be determined according to a height of an initial step height formed on the substrate WF to be surface roughened. For example, a height of an unevenness formed as a result of surface roughening the substrate WF can be 80% or smaller of a largest initial step formed on the substrate WF. Alternatively, the height of the unevenness may be 80% or smaller of an average of initial steps. For example, for a largest initial step of 1.0 μm, a height of an unevenness formed as a result of roughening the surface of the substrate WF is preferably 0.8 μm or smaller. This is because since the step height reduction ratio in a general CMP is around 80%, when an unevenness whose height is larger than 80% of initial step height is formed as a result of roughening the surface of the substrate WF, there is a risk that the unevenness cannot be polished away thoroughly in the following polishing step. An average pitch of an unevenness formed as a result of roughening the surface of the substrate (an average of distances between adjacent recessed portions or protruded portions) is desirably 100 μm or smaller. This is because since a step height reduction in the CMP largely depends on a width of an unevenness, with the average pitch being larger than 100 μm, the step height reduction ratio is decreased remarkably. The size and type of roughening particles for use in roughening the surface of the substrate WF, the contact pressure between the surface roughening pads <b>104</b>, <b>138</b> and the substrate WF, and the surface roughening time are selected as required so that a desired surface roughening is achieved. In general, hard roughening particles are used when a target layer to be surface roughened is hard, or when attempting to form a large unevenness as a result of surface roughening, relatively large size of roughening particles are used. In addition, when initial step height formed on the surface of the substrate WF is small, the concentration of roughening particles may be reduced, a supply amount of roughening particles may be reduced, or roughening particles are supplied intermittently. Further, when a thickness of a film to be surface roughened is extremely thin or small, or when a fragile material such as a Low-k material is used, it is concerned that an unevenness formed as a result of surface roughening should become too large. In such a case, a protective film may be formed on the surface of the substrate WF before the substrate WF is surface roughened, whereafter the substrate WF is surface roughened. Such a protective film can be formed by, for example, spraying an organic-based solvent such as a resist or through spin coating. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the surface roughened substrate WF.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0080]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the substrate WF has been surface roughened, then, the substrate WF is cleaned (S<b>104</b>). In the event that the substrate WF is not cleaned after it has been surface roughened, roughening particles used to surface roughen the substrate WF remain, causing a risk of scratch on the substrate WF in the following polishing step. However, the cleaning step may be omitted unless the cleaning of the substrate WF is necessary after it has been surface roughened. For example, in the case where roughening particles are the same in type and particle size as particles contained in a slurry for use in the following polishing step, since there are little risk that the roughening particles cause a scratch on the substrate WF in the polishing step, the cleaning step may be omitted.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0081]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the substrate WF, which has been surface roughened and cleaned, is polished (S<b>106</b>). The substrate WF can be polished through CMP or the like. The substrate WF can be polished by an arbitrary CMP device. Since the surface of the substrate WF has been roughened before it is polished, no protruded portion of a large dimension exists, a problem with decrease of removal rate occurring at a protruded portion of a large dimension can be eliminated or mitigated. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the substrate which has been surface roughened and then polished. Here, since the initial steps illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> which are caused due to the wiring structures (the widths and densities of wirings) in the layer underneath the Cu layer <b>54</b> or plating conditions through electro plating are eliminated uniformly, dishing and erosion are mitigated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0082]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0083" num="0082">With the substrate WF being polished completely, the substrate WF is cleaned and is then dried (S<b>108</b>). When the substrate WF has been planarized completely in the way described above, the substrate WF is returned to the cassette <b>24</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the substrate WF is then transported to the following step.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0083]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0084" num="0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for planarizing a surface of a substrate. In the planarizing method of this embodiment, firstly, initial steps formed on a surface of a substrate WF to be planarized are measured (S<b>202</b>). Although an arbitrary measuring method can be used, for example, a method is adopted in which shapes of steps are measured directly using a laser microscope (of a confocal form) or a phase shift interference form or are obtained indirectly based on a difference in film thicknesses measured by making use of film thickness measurement. Next, it is determined whether or not the measured steps are smaller than a target value (S<b>204</b>). In relation to this measurement, a measuring module may be provided within the planarizing apparatus for measurement, or the measurement may be made outside the planarizing apparatus. The target value can be 100 nm as an average value or a maximum value. When the initial steps of the substrate WF are the target value or larger, conditions of the substrate WF are determined based on the height and pitch of the step shapes which are obtained from a difference between the target value and the current value, and thereafter, a target processing surface of the substrate WF is roughened, and the roughened target processing surface of the substrate WF being thereafter polished to be planarized (S<b>206</b> to S<b>212</b>). As this occurs, although not illustrated, a step of forming a protective film on the surface of the substrate WF which can prevent a large unevenness, compared with the initial steps, from being produced in the step of surface roughening may be inserted as a pre-treatment before the surface of the substrate WF is roughened. As has been described above, the protective film can be formed by spraying an organic-based solvent such as a resist or through spin coating. Steps from surface roughening of the substrate to planarization of the roughened target processing surface by polishing are the same as steps S<b>102</b> to S<b>108</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When the initial step height on the substrate WF are smaller than the target value, firstly, the substrate WF is polished down to a predetermined residual film thickness (S<b>214</b>). The substrate WF can be polished by a polishing unit <b>200</b> such as, for example, an arbitrary CMP device. After the substrate WF has been polished down to the predetermined residual film thickness by the polishing unit <b>200</b>, the substrate WF is cleaned and dried as required. Thereafter, the remained step height on the surface of the substrate WF are measured again (S<b>216</b>), and it is judged whether or not the measured step height is the target value or larger (S<b>218</b>). For example, the target value can be 10 nm as an average value or a maximum value. In the case where the step height on the surface of the substrate WF is smaller than the target value, planarization of the substrate WF is ended. In the case where the step height on the surface of the substrate WF is equal to or larger than the target value, the substrate WF is surface roughened and is then polished (S<b>222</b> to S<b>226</b>). As this occurs, although not illustrated, a step of forming a protective film on the surface of the substrate WF may be inserted as a pre-treatment before the surface of the substrate WF is roughened. Since the substrate WF has already been plished once, the remained step height on the surface of the substrate WF should be small. Therefore, to insert the protective film is more effective which can prevent to make a large unevenness compared with the initial steps in the step of surface roughening. Such a protective film can be formed by spraying an organic-based solvent such as a resist or through spin coating, as described above.</div>
