<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Devices such as integrated circuits (ICs), large scale integrations (LSIs), and light emitting diodes (LEDs) are formed by stacking a functional layer on a front surface of a wafer formed from silicon (Si), sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or the like as a base material and demarcating the functional layer by a plurality of crossing division lines. In addition, devices such as power devices and LEDs are formed by stacking a functional layer on a front surface of a wafer containing hexagonal single crystal silicon carbide (SiC) as a base material and demarcating the functional layer by a plurality of crossing division lines. The wafer formed with the devices is laser-processed along the division lines by a laser processing apparatus to be divided into individual device chips, and the individual device chips thus obtained are used in electric equipment such as mobile phones and personal computers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The wafer formed with the devices is generally produced by slicing a semiconductor ingot with a circular column shape by a wire saw. A front surface and a back surface of the sliced wafer are mirror-finished by polishing (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-94221, for example). However, when the ingot is sliced by the wire saw and the front surface and the back surface of the sliced wafer are polished, most part (70% to 80%) of the ingot is discarded, which is uneconomical. Particularly, a hexagonal single crystal SiC ingot is high in hardness and is difficult to slice by a wire saw, requiring a considerable time for slicing. Accordingly, poor productivity and high unit cost of the ingot are caused, which poses a problem in efficiency of producing a wafer.</div>

In the separation layer forming step, first, with one end face (the first end face <b>52</b> in the present embodiment) of the ingot <b>50</b> facing upward, the ingot <b>50</b> is sucked and held on an upper surface of the chuck table <b>66</b>.

Then, an imaging unit (not illustrated) of the laser processing apparatus <b>64</b> images the ingot <b>50</b> from above. Then, on the basis of an image of the ingot <b>50</b> imaged by the imaging unit, the chuck table <b>66</b> is moved and rotated by the x-axis direction moving means, the y-axis direction moving means, and the rotating means of the laser processing apparatus <b>64</b>, thereby adjusting a direction of the ingot <b>50</b> in a predetermined direction as well as a positional relation between the ingot <b>50</b> and the light collector <b>68</b> on a xy-plane.

In the ultrasonic wave generating step of the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first, with the first end face <b>52</b> which is an end face close to the separation layer <b>74</b> facing upward, the ingot holding unit <b>4</b> holds the ingot <b>50</b> on the upper surface of the holding table <b>18</b>.
