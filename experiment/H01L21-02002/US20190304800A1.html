Power devices, LEDs, or the like are formed on a wafer of single-crystal SiC (silicon carbide) by depositing a function layer on the face side of the wafer and demarcating the face side into a plurality of areas by a grid of projected dicing lines. A wafer with devices formed thereon is divided into individual device chips along projected dicing lines by a cutting apparatus, a laser processing apparatus, or the like. The produced device chips will be used in electric appliances such as mobile phones, personal computers, and so on.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">A wafer on which devices are to be formed is generally produced by cutting a thin slice off a cylindrical semiconductor ingot with a wire saw. The wafer thus produced has its face and reverse sides polished to a mirror finish (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-94221). Such a customary process of slicing wafers off a semiconductor ingot with a wire saw and polishing the face and reverse sides of the wafers is not economic because most (70% through 80%) of the semiconductor ingot is wasted. In particular, ingots of hexagonal single-crystal SiC are difficult to cut with a wire saw as they are hard, are poor in productivity as they take considerable time to cut, and pose problems in producing wafers efficiently as hexagonal single-crystal ingot are expensive to obtain.</div>
