<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Various devices such as integrated circuits (ICs), large scale integrated circuits (LSIs), and light emitting diodes (LEDs) are formed by forming a functional layer on the front side of a wafer formed of silicon (Si) or sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and partitioning this functional layer into a plurality of separate regions along a plurality of division lines. Further, power devices or optical devices such as LEDs are formed by forming a functional layer on the front side of a wafer formed of hexagonal single-crystal SiC and partitioning this functional layer into a plurality of separate regions along a plurality of division lines. The division lines of such a wafer having these devices are processed by a processing apparatus such as a cutting apparatus and a laser processing apparatus to thereby divide the wafer into a plurality of individual device chips respectively corresponding to the devices. The device chips thus obtained are used in various electrical equipment such as mobile phones and personal computers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the wafer on which the devices are to be formed is produced by slicing a cylindrical ingot with a wire saw. Both sides of the wafer sliced from the ingot are polished to a mirror finish (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-94221, for example). However, when the ingot is cut by the wire saw and both sides of each wafer are polished to obtain the product, a large proportion (70% to 80%) of the ingot is discarded to cause a problem of poor economy. In particular, an SiC ingot has high hardness and it is therefore difficult to cut this ingot with the wire saw. Accordingly, considerable time is required for cutting of the ingot, causing a reduction in productivity. Furthermore, since this ingot is high in unit price, there is a problem in efficiently producing a wafer in this prior art.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">A technique for solving this problem has been proposed (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-111143, for example). This technique includes the steps of setting the focal point of a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to hexagonal single-crystal SiC inside an SiC ingot, next applying the laser beam to the SiC ingot as scanning the laser beam on the SiC ingot to thereby form separation layers in a separation plane previously set inside the SiC ingot, and next breaking the SiC ingot along the separation plane where the separation layers have been formed, thus separating an SiC wafer from the SiC ingot.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there is a case that a facet area different in crystal structure from a nonfacet area exists in the SiC ingot. The refractive index in the facet area is higher than that in the nonfacet area, and the absorptivity of energy in the facet area is also higher than that in the nonfacet area. Accordingly, the depth and condition of the separation layer to be formed in the facet area may become different from those of the separation layer to be formed in the nonfacet area in applying the laser beam to the SiC ingot. As a result, there is a problem such that a step may be formed between the separation layer in the facet area and the separation layer in the nonfacet area. Further, to grind the wafer produced from the SiC ingot to thereby obtain a desired wafer thickness, the thickness of the wafer to be produced must be increased in consideration of the step between the facet area and the nonfacet area. Accordingly, the efficiency of production is insufficient.</div>
