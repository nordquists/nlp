A circular blade made of a. material with high hardness such as diamond may be rotated at high speed to cut the semiconductor wafer. As such a mechanical cutting method, a method of fixing the wafer with an adhesive dicing tape, and then cutting the wafer with a blade along a scribe lane is used. Therefore, the mechanical cutting method may not be performed in a batch process in which wafers are simultaneously cut. Also, in the mechanical cutting method, a plurality of cutting processes need to be partially performed. Therefore, the mechanical cutting method requires a lot of time. In addition, in the cutting process using the blade, problems due to mechanical damage and frictional heat generated in the semiconductor wafer may occur. For example, the blade tends to cause chipping of the front and back sides of the wafer. Debris generation is also one of the major concerns using the mechanical cutting method. Further, there is a disadvantage that the process cost is high due to replacement of the blade having a limited lifetime.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0051]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0052" num="0051">To maintain the strength and fix the blade to the equipment, the blade may have a certain thickness or more. Therefore, it is difficult to execute a fine dicing process by the mechanical cutting method. Furthermore, it is difficult to apply the mechanical cutting method to a small packaging process with a size of several tens of microns (μm) or less due to an interval between the cut portion for protecting the element from mechanical and thermal damage generated around the cut portion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0052]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0053" num="0052">In recent years, with the development of the techniques of semiconductor elements, the semiconductor chip region has been miniaturized. In addition to the conventional memory device structures, various fields such as flexible elements and elements using carbon-based materials occur. However, it is difficult to apply the mechanical cutting method to a miniaturized semiconductor chip region and various fields. Therefore, a stealth cutting method for forming a cutting pattern using a laser may be used, as a kind of a new dicing method capable of performing a fine process while maintaining process reliability, enhancing process yield, and enhancing economy.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0054" num="0053">The laser-based cutting method may be roughly divided into two methods. A first method is a method for cutting a specimen by removing a part of the specimen through a phase change such as, for example, liquefaction, vaporization or plasma formation, using a laser having a wavelength corresponding to an absorption band of the specimen to be cut. Thus, the laser beam may be absorbed by the specimen. Also, the laser beam may be focused on the surface of the wafer. In the first method, there is a limit in the amount of specimen that may be removed using one laser irradiation. Therefore, cutting may be performed in such a manner that the specimen material is removed in a depth direction through several times of scanning. As a result, wafer processing may take a lot of time. In addition, a wide heat affected zone (HAZ) may be formed in a peripheral region of wafer processing. Also, during the laser process, molten particles (e.g., silicon dust or other type of semiconductor dust) from the removed specimen may spread on the surface of the wafer. The first method has limits such as, for example, changing the physical property of the wafer, leaving the residual stress in the wafer to weaken the strength or lowering the uniformity of the specimen.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0054]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0054">A second method is to indirectly support cutting by generating a cutting pattern on the wafer rather than a physical removal of the specimen material.</div>

Various flattening methods such as, for example, a Spin on Glass (SOG), an ETCH BACK, and a REFLOW were developed to flatten the step. The developed methods are applied to the process of flattening the wafer. In the flattening process of the wafer, there are a mechanical polishing method and a chemical polishing method. In the mechanical polishing method, a work-affected layer is formed to become a defect on a semiconductor chip. In the chemical polishing method, although a work-affected layer is not generated, a flattened shape, that is, shape accuracy may not be obtained. Therefore, a flattening process for polishing a wafer by combining the mechanical polishing method and the chemical polishing method is required. As a result, a Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) technique was developed.</div>

The polishing head simultaneously performs the rotary motion and the oscillating motion and may perform pressurization with a constant pressure. Thus, during the CMP process, both the polishing table and the polishing head are rotated and the polishing head is kept oscillating. The wafer may be mounted on the polishing head part by surface tension or vacuum. The wafer surface and the polishing pad may be brought into contact with each other by the self-weight of the polishing head and the applied pressure. A slurry that is a working fluid may flow in a fine gap between the contact surfaces CMP slurries usually include nano-sized abrasive particles dispersed in acidic or basic solution. Also, a mechanical removal action may be performed by the abrasive particles in the slurry and the surface protrusions of the pad. Further, a chemical removal action may be performed by chemical components in the slurry. Irregular wear of the polishing pad may occur when the polishing process by CMP is executed. Therefore, conditioning of the next polishing pad may be executed during polishing or after polishing. The polishing process of step S<b>450</b> is not limited to CMP.</div>

Further, a contact angle of the stress relief layer <b>1160</b> may be lowered.

In addition, since a discharge using high voltage is performed in the atmospheric pressure state, the initial facility cost may be reduced. Furthermore, a continuous pretreatment is possible. Therefore, the plasma pretreatment method, which places emphasis on high value added industries such as current IT and electronic industry, may be applied to polymer elements such as the stress relief layer <b>1160</b>.</div>

The adhesive may use an adhesive dispensing method when bonding the individual chips to a substrate or a lead frame. A considerable process cost may be required by a dispensing process separately added for the chip bonding process. Besides cost, the adhesive dispensing method may have other reliability concerns. For example, it is difficult to control the application amount and thickness of the adhesive, due to the physical limitations and insufficient precision of the dispensing method. Also, it is difficult to maintain coating uniformity of the adhesive even after bonding between the chips.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0115]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0116" num="0115">A lamination technique of the chips is one of the major techniques that influence the utility and performance of semiconductor packages. If the interfacial adhesive strength between stacked chips is weak, the dimensional stability of the package may be lowered. In addition, the package may be easily deformed by stress such as external moisture or heat. Thus, a wire which is an electrical connection part may be damaged. Or, a front side of a chip with a circuit coated thereon may be damaged to significantly lower the reliability of the package. Therefore, it is necessary to replace the paste of the liquid application type conventionally used as the supporting film. A DAF may be used for the supporting film, as an interfacial adhesive that may faithfully bond the laminated chip interfaces according to these needs. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The DAF may be epoxy adhesives or any other suitable adhesives, and is film based instead of the liquid application type paste described above. To attach the DAF to a wafer is through lamination process instead of dispensing process. Because there is no need to covert the liquid adhesive material from a drop-shape to a thin two-dimensional film, the process window for a film such as the DAF is much wider than for the liquid paste material.</div>
