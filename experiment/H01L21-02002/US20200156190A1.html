The device chips thus obtained are used in various electrical equipment such as mobile phones and personal computers. Further, power devices or optical devices such as LEDs are formed by forming a functional layer on the front side of a wafer formed of hexagonal single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC) and partitioning this functional layer into a plurality of separate regions along a plurality of crossing division lines.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the wafer on which the devices are to be formed is produced by slicing an ingot with a wire saw. Both sides of the wafer sliced from the ingot are polished to a mirror finish (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-094221, for example). However, when the ingot is cut by the wire saw and both sides of each wafer are polished to obtain the product, 70% to 80% of the ingot is discarded to cause a problem of poor economy. In particular, a hexagonal single-crystal SiC ingot has high hardness and it is therefore difficult to cut this ingot with the wire saw. Accordingly, considerable time is required for cutting of the ingot, causing a reduction in productivity. Furthermore, since this ingot is high in unit price, there is a problem in efficiently producing a wafer in this prior art.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A technique for solving this problem has been proposed by the present applicant. This technique includes the steps of setting the focal point of a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to hexagonal single-crystal SiC inside an SiC ingot, next applying the laser beam to the ingot as scanning the laser beam on the ingot to thereby form a separation layer in a predetermined separation plane inside the ingot, and next separating a wafer from the ingot along the separation layer (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-111143, for example). Further, a similar technique has also been proposed. This technique includes the steps of setting the focal point of a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to hexagonal single-crystal Si inside an Si ingot at a predetermined depth from an end surface of the ingot, the predetermined depth corresponding to the thickness of a wafer to be produced, next applying the laser beam to the ingot as scanning the laser beam on the ingot to thereby form a modified portion at this predetermined depth inside the ingot, and next separating the wafer from the ingot along this modified portion (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-060862, for example).</div>

The ingot <b>2</b> is a hexagonal single-crystal SiC ingot having a substantially cylindrical shape in this preferred embodiment.

The ingot <b>2</b> has a substantially circular first end surface <b>4</b>, a substantially circular second end surface <b>6</b> opposite to the first end surface <b>4</b>, a substantially cylindrical surface <b>8</b> formed so as to connect the first end surface <b>4</b> and the second end surface <b>6</b>, a c-axis (&lt;0001&gt; direction) extending from the first end surface <b>4</b> to the second end surface <b>6</b>, and a c-plane ({0001} plane) perpendicular to the c-axis. In the ingot <b>2</b>, the c-axis is inclined by an off angle α (e.g., α=1, 3, or 6 degrees) with respect to a normal <b>10</b> to the first end surface <b>4</b>. The off angle α is formed between the c-plane and the first end surface <b>4</b>. The direction of formation of the off angle α (i.e., the direction of inclination of the c-axis) is depicted by an arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. Further, the cylindrical surface <b>8</b> of the ingot <b>2</b> is formed with a first orientation flat <b>12</b> and a second orientation flat <b>14</b>, which are rectangular as viewed in side elevation and function to indicate crystal orientation. The first orientation flat <b>12</b> is parallel to the direction A of formation of the off angle α, and the second orientation flat <b>14</b> is perpendicular to the direction A of formation of the off angle α.

Accordingly, the direction A of formation of the off angle α can be determined irrespective of whether or not the first end surface <b>4</b> is the front side of the ingot <b>2</b>. The ingot to be applied to the wafer producing method according to the present invention is not limited to the hexagonal single-crystal SiC ingot <b>2</b> mentioned above, but the ingot applicable may be an ingot having a c-axis not inclined with respect to the normal to the first end surface, that is, having a configuration such that the off angle α between the c-plane and the first end surface is 0 degrees (i.e., having a configuration such that the normal to the first end surface coincides with the c-axis).</div>
