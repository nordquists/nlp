<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In simple terms, semiconductor processing involves forming and removing various layers on wafers. Often a sacrificial layer is patterned on a surface of a wafer to protect one or more first layers of material during subsequent processing steps. Once the subsequent processing steps are complete, the sacrificial layer may be removed. When removing the sacrificial layer, it is important that the process for removing the sacrificial layer does not damage any of the layers exposed during the removal process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">For instance, a sacrificial layer is often formed on a front side of a wafer so that a back side of the wafer may be processed. After the front side processing is complete, the sacrificial layer is removed. There is a desire to remove the sacrificial layer without damaging the various components on the front side of the wafer.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more embodiments are directed to methods of removing a sacrificial layer from semiconductor wafers during wafer processing. In at least one embodiment, the sacrificial layer is removed from a wafer during an O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch step. In one embodiment, the sacrificial layer is poly(p-phenylene-2, 6-benzobisoxazole) (PBO) or polyimide. The O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch step causes a residue to form on the wafer. The residue is removed by immersing the wafer a solution that is a mixture of the tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and water.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one embodiment is directed to a method that includes forming a layer of PBO or polyimide on a first side of a semiconductor wafer. The first side of the semiconductor wafer includes a plurality of dice with active surfaces. The wafer may be flipped over so that a back side of the wafer is processed. For example, the wafer may be thinned, etched, or both.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">After back side wafer processing is complete, the layer of PBO or polyimide may then be removed. Removing the layer of PBO or polyimide includes etching the layer in an O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch step and immersing the wafer in a wet etch solution. The wet etch solution includes a combination of TMAH and water. The wet etch solution removes any residue or by-products that may form on the wafer during the O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch step. That is, during etching of the PBO or polyimide layer in the O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch step, a residue forms on the wafer. The residue may include silicon, oxygen, or carbon or any combination thereof. The wet etch solution is able to remove the residue without damaging the integrity of bond pads and passivation layers at the active surface of plurality of dice. Thus, bonds formed between bond pads of the dice on the wafer and conductive elements, such as a conductive wire, during assembly are thereby improved.</div>
