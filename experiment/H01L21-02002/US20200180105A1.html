<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the case where a device chip is fabricated from a disk-shaped workpiece or the like, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-153090, a polishing target face is polished by a polishing pad having a polishing face of an area sufficient to cover the polishing target face of the disk-shaped workpiece after the disk-shaped workpiece is ground by whetstones so as to be thinned.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the grinding process, a grinding wheel on which whetstones are disposed annularly is rotated such that the disk-shaped workpiece is ground to a uniform thickness by the whetstones. In order to grind a disk-shaped workpiece to a uniform thickness, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2013-119123, grinding is temporarily stopped during the grinding process and the thickness of the disk-shaped workpiece is measured at totaling three points including a middle point of a radius of the disk-shaped workpiece (intermediate position between the center and an outer circumferential edge of the disk-shaped workpiece) and two points spaced by an equal distance from the middle point in a direction toward the center and a direction toward the outer circumference. Then, the relationship of an inclination (hereinafter referred to also as “inclination relationship”) between a spindle shaft for rotating the grinding wheel and a table rotation shaft of a holding table for holding the disk-shaped workpiece is changed so as to eliminate the thickness difference of the disk-shaped workpiece at the three measurement points.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case where a disk-shaped workpiece ground to a uniform thickness is polished, a central portion of the disk-shaped workpiece with regard to which the time period for which a polishing pad contacts is long is polished by a greater amount and a disk-shaped workpiece having a shape in which the center is recessed shape is sometimes formed. Further, in a grinding and polishing apparatus in which the same holding table is used in grinding and polishing, the holding face of the holding table has a conical shape in which the center is a vertex. If the disk-shaped workpiece after grinding held by the holding table having a conical shape is polished, then the polishing pad is contacted strongly with a central portion of the disk-shaped workpiece, and therefore, the central portion is polished by a greater amount. As a countermeasure, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-223636, the polishing face of a polishing pad is partially dressed to adjust the shape of the polishing face such that the center of the polishing face does not contact with the disk-shaped workpiece strongly thereby to uniformize the disk-shaped workpiece after polishing.</div>
