It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, features illustrated or described for one embodiment can be used on or in conjunction with other embodiments to yield yet a further embodiment. It is intended that the present disclosure includes such modifications and variations. The examples are described using specific language, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the appending claims. The drawings are not scaled and are for illustrative purposes only. Corresponding elements are designated by the same reference signs in the different drawings if not stated otherwise.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">The terms “having”, “containing”, “including”, “comprising” and the like are open, and the terms indicate the presence of stated structures, elements or features but do not preclude the presence of additional elements or features. The articles “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural as well as the singular, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The term “electrically connected” describes a permanent low-resistive connection between electrically connected elements, for example a direct contact between the concerned elements or a low-resistive connection via a metal and/or heavily doped semiconductor material. The term “electrically coupled” includes that one or more intervening element(s) adapted for signal and/or power transmission may be connected between the electrically coupled elements, for example, elements that are controllable to temporarily provide a low-resistive connection in a first state and a high-resistive electric decoupling in a second state. An ohmic contact is a non-rectifying electrical junction with a linear or almost linear current-voltage characteristic.</div>

For example, “n−” means a doping concentration which is lower than the doping concentration of an “n”-doping region while an “n+”-doping region has a higher doping concentration than an “n”-doping region. Doping regions of the same relative doping concentration do not necessarily have the same absolute doping concentration. For example, two different “n”-doping regions may have the same or different absolute doping concentrations.</div>

In other words, the base portion, the auxiliary layer and the surface layer may be vertically stacked upon each other (e.g., the base portion, the auxiliary layer and the surface layer may be vertically stacked directly upon each other). The surface layer may be the topmost layer and the exposed surface of the surface layer may form a first one of the two main surfaces of the semiconductor substrate. The surface layer may comprise a first main surface of the semiconductor substrate. For example, the surface layer may be formed in contact (e.g., direct contact) with the first main surface.

Anodic dissolution occurs during electrochemical etching, wherein a metal or semiconductor dissolves from an anodic workpiece in a cathodic electrolyte. The electrochemical dissolution efficiency may correspond to the amount of material that can be removed with electrochemical etching under the same conditions, for example with the current or the voltage kept constant.

For example, this may be the case for the so-called voltage-driven electrochemical etching (i.e., when applying a constant voltage). The electrochemical dissolution rate is the rate at which a certain material dissolves in an electrolyte. In the voltage-driven case, a more conductive portion of a semiconductor material may have a higher electrochemical dissolution rate than a less conductive portion of the same semiconductor material with the same conductivity type.

In this case, the electrochemical etching may affect the auxiliary layer for a longer time than the surface layer and/or the base portion. It may be possible that the electrochemical etching will (e.g., automatically) stop earlier for the base portion and/or the surface layer due to, for example, different electrical properties of these layers (or this layer, respectively) compared to the auxiliary layer.
