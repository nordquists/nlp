<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Elemental semiconductors and compound semiconductors are the basis of modern electronics. The semiconductor industry spent about $7.2 billion worldwide on wafers that serve as substrates for microelectronic components. The functionality of semiconductor devices typically lies on the surface of a semiconductor. Therefore, the bulk of the wafer usually does not offer additional benefits for the electronic device. However, it is challenging for conventional semiconductor growth processes, which usually utilize ingot growth, to grow thinner semiconductor wafers due to the mechanical fragility of the material. As a result, semiconductor devices are usually accompanied by a thick wafer body during fabrication.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, in the current semiconductor industry, the wafer is strongly bonded to the semiconductor device with covalent bonding, which makes it challenging to separate the device layer from the wafer without damaging either the device or wafer or both. Therefore, the entire wafer is usually sacrificed during fabrication, thereby increasing the overall cost of the electronics. While germanium or other compound semiconductors are intensively investigated for various electronics, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, photovoltaic cells, and sensors, their commercial applications are limited to specific fields mainly due to the prohibitive cost of the germanium or compound wafer substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">To circumvent this challenge, various methods have been developed over the past decade for wafer recycling, such as chemical lift-off, optical lift-off, and laser lift-off. However, even after a decade of development, the aforementioned methods have not been successful in securing adoption for mass production due to their slow release rate of the active layers, low yield, and the need for post-release treatment of the host substrate.</div>
