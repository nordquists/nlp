As the process for treating the substrate is performed, a cured thin-film is coated or deposited on a surface of the substrate. Further, an edge bead removing process is required to increase a production yield at an edge of the substrate. The edge bead removing process removes an unwanted thin-film and an attached byproduct polymer from the edge region of the substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing performing an edge bead removing process in a conventional substrate treating apparatus. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional substrate treating apparatus <b>1</b> has a rotary chuck <b>2</b> and a nozzle <b>4</b>. The rotary chuck <b>2</b> supports and rotates a substrate W. The nozzle <b>4</b> sprays chemical C on an edge region of the substrate W. Each nozzle <b>4</b> is disposed above and below the substrate W to spray the chemical C on top and bottom surfaces of the substrate W. The sprayed chemical C removes a thin-film F disposed on the edge region of the substrate W. However, when the edge bead removing process is performed by spraying the chemical C, the removal of the thin-film F in the edge region of the substrate W is not properly performed. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the thin-film F in the edge region of the substrate W may be removed obliquely downwards outwardly in a radial direction of the substrate W. This is because the liquid chemical C is supplied while the substrate W is rotated. When the removal of the thin-film F in the edge region of the substrate W is not performed properly, a yield of a production process is reduced. Moreover, there is a risk of additional contamination due to formation of a pin mark on a surface of the substrate W after the removal process.</div>
