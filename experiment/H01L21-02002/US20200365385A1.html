The scope of the present disclosure is not intended to be limited by the embodiments described hereinafter or by the drawings, which are taken to be illustrative only. The drawings are to be regarded as being schematic representations and elements illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily shown to scale.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">The term “over” and/or “overlying” is not to be construed as meaning only “directly over” and/or “having direct contact with”. Rather, if one element is “over” and/or “overlying” another element (e.g., a layer is overlying another layer or a layer is deposited over another layer), a further element (e.g., a further layer) may be positioned between the two elements (e.g., a further layer may be positioned between a first layer and a second layer if the first layer is “over” and/or “overlying” the second layer).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The semiconductor substrate or body may extend along a main extension plane. The term “horizontal” as used in this specification intends to describe an orientation substantially parallel to said main extension plane. A first or main horizontal side of the semiconductor substrate or body may run substantially parallel to horizontal directions or may have surface sections that enclose an angle of at most 8° (or at most 6°) with the main extension plane. The first or main horizontal side can be for instance the surface of a wafer or a die. Sometimes, the horizontal direction is also referred to as lateral direction.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Semiconductor material may be processed to manufacture semiconductor devices, such as two-terminal devices (e.g., diodes), three-terminal devices (e.g., field-effect transistors (FETs), metal-oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), junction field effect transistors (JFETs) and/or thyristors), and/or semiconductor devices having more than three terminals.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, a wide band-gap semiconductor material (e.g., a semiconductor material with a band-gap greater than 2 eV), such as silicon carbide (SiC) and/or gallium nitride (GaN) may be used for manufacturing semiconductor devices. The wide band-gap semiconductor material may have a high breakdown field strength (e.g., greater than 2.5 MV/cm) and/or a high critical avalanche field strength. Accordingly, when using the wide band-gap semiconductor material, doping of semiconductor regions may be higher compared with lower band-gap semiconductor materials, which may reduce an on-resistance (RON). Examples presented herein are mainly explained with regard to SiC as a wide band-gap semiconductor material, but one or more techniques presented herein may be applied to other types of wide band-gap semiconductor materials, such as other wide band-gap semiconductor materials that allow for porosification and/or where chemical and/or electrochemical etching (e.g., electrochemical polishing) is not possible and/or is not efficient to achieve a smoother surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">A SiC layer (e.g., bulk SiC, ground SiC, and/or a SiC layer of a split SiC wafer) may be provided. One or more devices (e.g., one or more semiconductor devices) may be disposed within the SiC layer and/or at a side of the SiC layer. In some examples, a first side of the SiC layer (e.g., a surface of the SiC layer corresponding to the first side) may be smoothed (e.g., planarized) for (further) processing of the SiC layer. The first side of the SiC layer may be rough as a result of splitting a SiC wafer to obtain the SiC layer (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), for example. The first side may be smoothed in order to apply one or more processes to the SiC layer, such as metallization and/or deposition of an epitaxial layer onto the SiC layer (and/or onto the first side of the SiC layer). For example, the one or more processes may be applied for forming a semiconductor device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some examples, in order to smooth the first side of the SiC layer for subsequent processing and/or in order to reduce a thickness of the SiC layer to a desired thickness, grinding (e.g., grinding using a grinding wheel) of the SiC layer may be performed to remove portions of SiC of the SiC layer. However, due to a high hardness and/or a toughness (e.g., a low fracture toughness) of SiC, grinding the SiC layer is a slow (e.g., 10 μm/min) and/or an expensive process (e.g., grinding of the SiC layer may be associated with a high consumption of the grinding wheel). Further, grinding the SiC layer may deteriorate a surface quality and/or a subsurface quality of the SiC layer. For example, grinding the SiC layer may introduce crystal damage and/or crystal defects to the SiC layer. Polishing (e.g., chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) and/or etching (e.g., wet etching and/or plasma etching) may be applied to the SiC layer to increase the surface quality and/or the subsurface quality of the SiC layer (e.g., the surface quality and/or the subsurface quality may be increased via polishing and/or etching in order to deposit the epitaxial layer onto the SiC layer and/or in order to perform metallization).</div>

Thus, smoothing the first side of the SiC layer and/or reducing the thickness of the SiC layer to the desired thickness may take an extended period of time and/or may be expensive. Alternatively and/or additionally, the SiC layer may be made of a SiC polytype different than the 4H-SiC polytype (e.g., a 2H-SiC polytype and/or a 6H-SiC polytype). Hereinafter “made of” is to be interpreted within typical manufacturing tolerances, i.e., the SiC layer may comprise impurities caused by manufacturing and/or dopants from a different material.</div>

The porous layer may be removed to expose a smoothed surface of the SiC layer. For example, the smoothed surface may have a surface roughness that is less than a surface roughness of the first side of the SiC layer. Converting the first portion of the SiC layer to the porous layer and/or removing the porous layer may require fewer resources, may cost less and/or may be faster than grinding the SiC layer (without converting the first portion of the SiC layer to the porous layer) at the first side in order to smoothen the first side and/or in order to reduce the thickness of the SiC layer, which may be especially advantageous in embodiments where the SiC layer is made of the 4H-SiC polytype (having a hardness and/or a toughness higher than other SiC polytypes) and/or a different SiC polytype having a high hardness and/or a high toughness.</div>
