<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a process and apparatus for manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) and to a carrier comprising a plurality of integrated circuits. In particular, the invention relates to a process and apparatus for manufacturing a plurality of discrete ICs on a flexible substrate and to a carrier comprising a plurality of discrete integrated circuits on a flexible substrate.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Current wafer processing techniques involve placing a wafer, typically of crystallised silicon and comprising a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) thereon, on an adhesive film on a large wafer frame. The wafer is diced before being placed into an integration machine under tension to create spaces between adjacent dies, each of the dies comprising an IC. During handling of the resulting integrated circuit (IC), a single die may then be picked up or displaced from the adhesive film and either placed directly onto a first support having corresponding contact pads during the formation of an electronic circuit, or if orientation flipping is required placed onto a second pick tool before placement onto the said support having corresponding contact pads.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In processes using a flexible plastic substrate as opposed to a silicon wafer, the same process can be accomplished, with an additional step of a release process from an initial carrier (e.g. glass, polycarbonate or quartz), supporting the flexible plastic substrate, prior to the transfer of the plastic substrate to a transfer means in an integration apparatus. This process of removal from the glass carrier results in an array of diced flexible ICs in a format that has sufficient adhesion for shipment and handling on the glass carrier, whilst also allowing for a vacuum head to remove individual flexible ICs from the glass carrier during subsequent handling.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Release processes for a flexible plastic substrate, on which the electronics (e.g. integrated circuits) are laid, from the carrier (e.g. glass, polycarbonate or quartz) typically involve treatment from the backside of the carrier with an electromagnetic radiation source (e.g. a laser, flashlamp, high powered LED, an infrared radiation source or the like). The mechanism will depend on whether the electromagnetic radiation source causes predominantly a photonic ablation (through absorption) or a thermal process (e.g. heat-release). Optionally an adhesive/release material can be employed between the carrier and the flexible plastic substrate. The laser is scanned at fixed, discrete intervals across the surface. The laser modifies the interface between the flexible plastic substrate (e.g. a film) and the glass carrier, either by local ablation of a thin layer of substrate, or by reducing bond strength. Control of the laser to achieve this balanced release in a uniform manner has proven difficult with a narrow process window.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In conventional processes, singulating the ICs on a substrate (wafer), flexible or rigid, is performed by ‘dicing’, that is cutting the substrate along straight lines between the ICs after they are formed in a process known as ‘back end processing’ and, if the wafer is flexible, subsequently releasing the discrete ICs to form singulated ICs. When dicing flexible substrates this conventional approach is often performed by a laser or abrasive water jet. Such processes are time-consuming and produce ‘dirty’ waste material that must be removed from the completed substrate (wafer). Furthermore, the processes may generate significant local heating of the substrate and may produce poor edge quality around each singulated IC. In addition, the scribe line width formed between each of the discrete ICs in the dicing process may be at least 10 μm which width is a waste of valuable substrate.</div>

In certain embodiments, the via is narrower at the bottom than at the top (i.e. the via walls are converging towards the bottom). Subsequently, a metal layer is deposited, allowing for no breakages at the via edges, thus routing the metal both down to contact the carrier, and up to the top of the substrate layer. The bottom contact pad area is defined in this method by the size of the via, leading to large etched regions of the flexible substrate. In other words, deposition of a metal contact pad prior to deposition of the IC substrate unit optionally allows that contact pad to be larger in area than an internal feature (e.g. an internal via) subsequently formed above it and filled with metal to connect to it. In contrast, bottom side contacts formed only after deposition of the IC substrate unit may be limited in area to that of the internal feature.</div>
