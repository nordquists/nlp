<heading id="h-0002">Field of the Invention</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an edge trimming apparatus that executes trimming of the circumferential part of a wafer.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">When a wafer is ground by a grinding abrasive stone and the thickness thereof is made smaller, there is a problem that a chamfered part at the circumference of the wafer becomes a sharp edge and the wafer breaks with the sharp edge being the point of origin. Thus, there is an edge trimming apparatus for removing the circumferential part of a wafer before grinding (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2010-165802 or Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2017-004989).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The edge trimming apparatus brings an abrasive stone into contact with the circumferential part of a wafer held by a holding surface of a chuck table and rotates the wafer to remove the circumferential part. If processing dust discharged due to this edge trimming processing enters a gap between the lower surface of the wafer and the holding surface of the chuck table and adheres on the holding surface, the height of the lower surface of the wafer held by the holding surface does not become constant. For this reason, for example, in the case of completely cutting a chamfered part of a bonded wafer obtained by bonding a wafer to a substrate by an adhesive as in a method disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2017-004989, there is a problem that the adhesive existing on the bonded surface adheres to a cutting blade and the cutting processing becomes impossible.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to solve this problem, a ring-shaped groove with an outer diameter slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the wafer is formed in a flat upper surface of the chuck table. The ring-shaped groove is made to communicate with a suction source and the wafer is held under suction by the ring-shaped groove. In addition, most part of the upper surface of the chuck table is formed as a sliding surface to suppress adhesion of processing dust.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, processing dust enters a gap between the chuck table and the wafer from the circumferential edge of the wafer and the processing dust adheres to the vicinity of the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table in some cases, which causes a problem.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide an edge trimming apparatus that can hold a wafer by a chuck table with a holding surface to which processing dust is not adhered.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an edge trimming apparatus including a chuck table that has a ring-shaped groove with an outer diameter smaller than the outer diameter of a wafer and causes the ring-shaped groove to communicate with a suction source to hold under suction a lower surface of the wafer by the ring-shaped groove, a table rotation mechanism that rotates the chuck table, a cutting unit that rotates a spindle on which a cutting blade is mounted and annularly cuts a circumferential part of the wafer held by the chuck table, and a cleaning unit that cleans a region outside the ring-shaped groove in an upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove. The cleaning unit is positioned to the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove, and the chuck table is rotated by the table rotation mechanism, to clean the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the edge trimming apparatus further includes a horizontal movement mechanism that moves the cutting unit in the center axis direction of the spindle. The cutting unit includes a spindle unit that rotates the spindle to which a mount on which the cutting blade is mounted is coupled and a blade cover that surrounds the mount and the cutting blade. The cleaning unit includes a cleaning nozzle that is mounted on the blade cover and jets high-pressure water in a downward direction. A landing area of the high-pressure water jetted from the cleaning nozzle is positioned to the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove by the horizontal movement mechanism, and cleaning is executed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the cleaning unit includes a sponge and a nozzle for sponge that supplies cleaning water to the sponge. The sponge is positioned to the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove, and cleaning is executed by the sponge to which the cleaning water is supplied from the nozzle for sponge.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, the wafer can be flatly held by the chuck table that has been cleaned and has an upper surface to which processing dust is not adhered. Therefore, the depth of the recess formed at the circumferential edge of the wafer by edge trimming processing can be made constant. Moreover, because the inside of the ring-shaped groove of the chuck table can be cleaned, it becomes possible to prevent the lowering of the suction force of the chuck table that possibly occurs due to clogging of the ring-shaped groove with processing dust.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, for example, in the edge trimming apparatus including two cutting units opposed to each other, each cutting unit can include the cleaning nozzle as the cleaning unit, and the cleaning areas of the respective cleaning nozzles can be made different to change the role in the cleaning. For example, one cleaning nozzle is used as a nozzle dedicated to intensive cleaning for the region immediately outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and is caused to jet high-pressure water in a circular column shape. Meanwhile, the other cleaning nozzle is used as a nozzle dedicated to cleaning of a wide range mainly for the upper surface of the chuck table and the ring-shaped groove and is caused to jet the high-pressure water in a fan shape. This enables cleaning of the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove more efficiently.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, when the cleaning unit includes the sponge and the nozzle for sponge that supplies the cleaning water to the sponge, the sponge is positioned to the region outside the ring-shaped groove in the upper surface of the chuck table and the upper surface of the chuck table including the ring-shaped groove, and cleaning is executed by the sponge to which the cleaning water is supplied from the nozzle for sponge. Accordingly, the wafer can be flatly held by the chuck table that has been cleaned and has an upper surface to which processing dust is not adhered. Therefore, the depth of the recess formed at the circumferential edge of the wafer by edge trimming processing can be made constant. Furthermore, because the inside of the ring-shaped groove can be cleaned, it becomes possible to prevent the lowering of the suction force of the chuck table.</div>

In the wafer W, chamfering processing has been executed for the circumferential edge, and a chamfered part Wd (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) whose section has a substantially circular arc shape is formed.
