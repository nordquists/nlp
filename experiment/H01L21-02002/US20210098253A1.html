<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Various embodiments of the present application are directed towards a method for forming a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate with a thick device layer and a thick insulator layer. In some embodiments, the method includes forming an insulator layer covering a handle substrate, and epitaxially forming a device layer on a sacrificial substrate. The sacrificial substrate is bonded to a handle substrate, such that the device layer and the insulator layer are between the sacrificial and handle substrates, and the sacrificial substrate is removed. The removal includes performing an etch into the sacrificial substrate until the device layer is reached. Because the device layer is formed by epitaxy and transferred to the handle substrate, the device layer may be formed with a large thickness. Further, because the epitaxy is not affected by the thickness of the insulator layer, the insulator layer may be formed with a large thickness.</div>

In recent years, semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrates have emerged as an alternative to bulk semiconductor substrates. An SOI substrate comprises a handle substrate, an insulator layer overlying the handle substrate, and a device layer overlying the insulator layer. Among other things, an SOI substrate leads to reduced parasitic capacitance, reduced leakage current, reduced latch up, and improved semiconductor device performance (e.g., lower power consumption and higher switching speed).</div>

Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</div>

The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.

As appreciated in some aspects of the present disclosure, some SOI substrates include an insulator layer that includes mobile metal contaminants, such as sodium and/or potassium. These mobile metal contaminants may inadvertently enter the insulator layer of the SOI substrate during processing, and tend to induce a higher leakage current and/or reduce a breakdown voltage in the insulator layer. Thus, to mitigate the effects of these metal contaminants, some aspects of the present disclosure include an SOI substrate where the insulator layer is fortified with a getter material having a getter concentration profile. The getter material can comprise a halogen, such as fluorine (F) or chlorine (Cl) for example. The getter material binds to the mobile metal contaminants to reduce current leakage and/or increase a breakdown voltage in the insulator layer. Thus, the presence of the getter material in the insulator layer binds these metal contaminants, thereby reducing leakage current and/or increasing the breakdown voltage of the insulator layer.</div>
