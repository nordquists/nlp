<div class="abstract">A substrate processing system includes: a batch-type processing part that collectively processes a lot including substrates arranged at a first pitch; a single-substrate-type processing part that processes the substrates of the lot one by one; and an interface part that delivers the substrates between the batch-type processing part and the single-substrate-type processing part. The batch-type processing part includes a processing bath that stores a processing solution having a lump shape or a mist shape, a first holder that holds the substrates arranged at the first pitch, and a second holder that receives the substrates arranged at a second pitch from the first holder in the processing solution. The interface part includes a transfer part that transfers the substrates held separately by the first and second holders in the processing solution, from the batch-type processing part to the single-substrate-type processing part.</div>
