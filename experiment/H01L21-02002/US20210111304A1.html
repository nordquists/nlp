<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Since electronic components require and trend towards smaller size, improved performance, and environmental protection and energy saving, high-density and high-energy electronic components such as LED street lights, MOSFET, IGBT and laser components, that are high-power, high-frequency or high-heat environments and have more than 100 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>of heat dissipation, have become the key technological projects for the major development of related industries. If the heat generated by the long-term work of these densely arranged components is not timely removed from the limited heat dissipation space of the package, the performance and lifetime of these components will be reduced due to the increase of the junction temperature. Also, the accumulation of high-temperature thermal stress between materials will inevitably cause component reliability problems. Therefore, it needs to eliminate the heat with an excellent heat dissipation package and high thermal conductivity materials.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the existing technology, a ceramic substrate is mostly used for such as light-emitting diodes, stacked memories and stacked integrated circuits use silicon (Si) materials and alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) ceramic materials to serve as a heat dissipation substrate. Recently, aluminum nitride is very popular among the electronic applied materials because of its high thermal conductivity (170-230 W/mK, close to silicon carbide and beryllium oxide, and 5-7 times the thermal conductivity of aluminum oxide), low dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, good electrical insulation, low thermal expansion coefficient close to silicon (4.2×10<sup>−6</sup>/° C.) and gallium arsenide (5.7×10<sup>−6</sup>/° C.), no toxicity of beryllium oxide and lower producing cost. Thus, aluminum nitride may be used in a wide range of applications, such as packaging substrates of semiconductor and microelectronics, carrier substrates of high-brightness LED chips, automotive electronics, lighting components, heat dissipation materials of high-power electronic components, etc. Aluminum nitride has great potential to gradually replace other ceramic substrate materials in the future.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known that the heat conduction coefficient of the commercially available monocrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate is about 200-240 W/mK, and the heat conduction coefficient of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate is about 170-180 W/mK. Presently, the commercially available product is the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate mainly, and its price is much lower than the price of the monocrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate. However, the types of the crystallization phase of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate are more than the monocrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate, and the surface of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate is not conducive to make subsequent process(es) be performed on the components such as light-emitting diodes, stacked memories and stacked integrated circuits.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate is made of aluminum nitride powder, wherein the aluminum nitride powder may be processed through such as hydraulic forming, cold isostatic pressing (CIP) densification, degumming, high temperature sintering, etc., and then, the precision cutting process and grinding and polishing process are performed to obtain the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate with a flatten surface. However, when performing the grinding and polishing process, this process will cause the polycrystalline aluminum nitride powder to peel off, such that some holes may appear on the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate, so as to increase the surface roughness of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The most attractive application of aluminum nitride substrate is the development of ultraviolet (UV) LED, wherein UV LED has great commercial value in biomedical diagnosis. Presently, the most commonly used substrate for UV LED is sapphire, but a lattice difference between sapphire and aluminum nitride is up to 13%. Therefore, it is a big challenge to grow monocrystalline aluminum nitride or aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) with high aluminum content on the sapphire substrate. Also, this is one of the reasons why the luminous efficiency of the UV LED drops sharply once the wavelength of the UV LED is below 300 nm. Although some research teams have proposed a solution to replace the sapphire substrate with a monocrystalline aluminum nitride substrate, due to the high price of the monocrystalline aluminum nitride substrate, it cannot replace the sapphire substrate in the short term. If we can use MOCVD to grow a monocrystalline aluminum nitride thin film with desired quality on the polycrystalline aluminum nitride substrate, this will be an exciting research direction in the development of UV LED.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, the polycrystalline aluminum nitride substrate is provided first. A titanium metal layer is formed on the polycrystalline aluminum nitride substrate by a sputtering deposition (using a titanium target, and sputtering parameters: 100 W of power, 30-150 minutes of time, 8 sccm of flow rate of argon, and 5×10<sup>−3 </sup>torr of pressure) to serve as an adhesive layer.

Next, by using the metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and using trimethyl aluminum (TMAl) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to be raw materials, an aluminum nitride thin film epitaxial layer and an aluminum nitride thick film epitaxial layer are epitaxially grown in two stages (first stage MOCVD parameters: 950-1030° C. of temperature, 30 minutes of time, 10 sccm of flow rate of TMAl/500 sccm of flow rate of NH<sub>3</sub>, and 200 mbar of pressure; second stage MOCVD parameters: 1030-1160° C. of temperature, 60 minute of time, 20 sccm of flow rate of TMAl/1000 sccm of flow rate of NH<sub>3</sub>, and 200 mbar of pressure), so as to complete the surface modification of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a cross-sectional view of a polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate after processing surface modification according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The crystallization phase identification is performed by using X-ray diffractometer. First, the crystallization phase identification for the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate is performed. As shown in (a) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it shows that the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate has diffraction peaks of the polycrystalline aluminum nitride material at 20=23.4°, 25.4°, 29.6°, 30.7°, 33.2°, 34.3°, 36.0°, 37.9°, 49.8°, 59.4°, 66.1°, 69.7°, 71.5° and 72.7°. One titanium metal thin film is formed on the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate by the sputtering deposition to serve as the adhesive layer, and then, the aluminum nitride buffer layer and the aluminum nitride epitaxial layer are formed on the titanium metal thin film/the polycrystalline aluminum nitride ceramic substrate by the sputtering deposition and the metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).

The distribution of the crystal face of AlN shown in SEM picture is consistent with the measuring result of XRD (X-ray diffraction). Generally, the quantum well grown on the c-plane is a polar quantum well which has the largest polarized electric field. The crystal face of (101) is very helpful to the luminous efficiency of UV LED, wherein the surface of this pyramid may greatly reduce the probability of total reflection of the light beam inside the component, so as to effectively improve the light extraction efficiency of the LED.
