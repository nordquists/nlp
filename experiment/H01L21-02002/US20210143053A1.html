<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">For most applications involving the transmission or reception of radio frequency signals (10 MHz to 100 GHz), the devices require a substrate that increasingly fulfills demanding specifications, particularly driven by the changing standards of mobile telephony (2G, 3G, LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced PRO, 5G . . . ). The properties of substrate materials must specifically ensure:
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">Low insertion losses (low signal attenuation) and good linearity (low signal distortion causing harmonics), typically by presenting an effective resistivity over a wide range of frequencies, greater than 1000 ohms.cm;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">Stability of these temperature performances, particularly within the range of use of devices(−40° C. to 150° C.);</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0006">Sufficient heat dissipation capacity, typically due to a thermal conductivity greater than 20 W/m·K;</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0007">A weak capacitive coupling between the active layer and the support substrate, typically thanks to a dielectric permittivity equal to or lower than that of silicon (ε<sub>silicon</sub>=11).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0008">Moreover, in order to meet high volume requirements, the substrate must be compatible with the semiconductor industry and particularly with CMOS silicon manufacturing lines. Of course, it must also have a competitive cost to be adopted by consumer applications, particularly in the field of telecommunications (telephony and cellular network, WiFi connectivity, Bluetooth). Space and military applications are particularly sensitive to performance and temperature resistance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0009">Radio frequency (RF) devices such as antenna switches and adaptors, power amplifiers, low noise amplifiers or even passive components (R, L, C) can be developed on different types of substrates.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0010">For example, silicon-on-sapphire substrates known as SOS (silicon on sapphire) are known which allow the components produced using microelectronic technologies in the surface layer of silicon to benefit from the insulating properties of sapphire substrate materials, irrespective of temperature, its conductivity that is greater than 20 W/m·K and its permittivity that is less than 11. For example, the antenna switches and power amplifiers manufactured on this type of substrate exhibit very good factors of merit but are mainly used for niche applications because of the too high overall cost of the solution.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0011">Also known are high-resistivity silicon substrates comprising a support substrate, a trapping layer (a few hundred nanometers to a few microns thick) laid out on the support substrate, a dielectric layer laid out on the trapping layer, and a semiconductor layer laid out on the dielectric layer. The support substrate usually has a resistivity greater than 1 kohm.cm. The trapping layer may comprise undoped polycrystalline silicon. The combination of a high resistivity silicon support substrate and a trapping layer, based on the state of the art, makes it possible to eliminate the parasitic conducting layer usually present under the oxide layer buried in the SOI HR (Silicon on insulator with high resistivity silicon support substrate). The skilled person will find a review of the performance of RF devices manufactured on a high resistivity semiconductor substrate known in the Background of the Invention in “Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) Technology, Manufacture and Applications,” points 10.7 and 10.8, Oleg Kononchuk and Bich-Yen Nguyen, Woodhead Publishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0012">Nevertheless, a poly-silicon trapping layer has the disadvantage of undergoing partial recrystallization during high temperature heat treatment steps, which contributes to reducing the density of traps in the layer. The degradation of the RF device performance related to this decrease in the density of traps may be prohibitive for certain applications. Moreover, these substrates struggle to ensure the stability of the RF performances over the entire range of operating temperatures, particularly above 100° C. Their resistivity falls considering the generation of thermal carriers in the support substrate and the coupling device/substrate becomes a major contributor to signal attenuation and distortion. Performance degradation has also been observed when the temperature drops below 0° C. Finally, permittivity will remain very close to that of silicon (about 11).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0013">Other support substrates, such as aluminum nitride or silicon carbide, would meet the RF properties specifications but are not compatible with the standard semiconductor industry. Their use as a support substrate for transferring the final layer of devices is conceivable. Nevertheless, the cost of these specific materials combined with that of the circuit transfer technologies is still too high for a mass adoption of these solutions.</div>
