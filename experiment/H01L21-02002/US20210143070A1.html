<li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">A SiC semiconductor device may be manufactured by forming an impurity layer, an insulating film and an electrode on a SiC wafer to form a semiconductor element, and then dividing the wafer into chip units. The patterning of a resist adopted as a photomask for forming the impurity layer, a trench, the insulating film and the electrode may be performed by adopting a stepper. For performing finer patterning of the resist with the stepper, the flatness of the SiC wafer is preliminary evaluated, and the SiC wafer having a finer evaluation is adopted for manufacturing the SiC semiconductor device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">In manufacturing SiC semiconductor devices, the situation of losing shape called defocus may occur at a fixed proportion in a situation where the patterning is performed by adopting the stepper. The focus margin (hereinafter referred to as DOF) may become narrower as the size of the photomask becomes finer, and the defocus occurrence rate may increase particularly in the finer patterning. “DOF” is the abbreviation for “Depth of Focus”.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">As a result of studies on the cause by the inventors of the present disclosure, the inventors found that the surface shape of the SiC wafer is different from the surface shape of the silicon (hereinafter simply referred to as Si) wafer. The inventors found that “waviness” is present on the surface. The “waviness” on the surface of the SiC wafer occurs, for example, when slicing from a SiC ingot using a wire saw, the wire saw is bent because SiC is a hard material next to diamond.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">The stepper performs focus measurement for measuring, for example, the tilt of the wafer surface to obtain a surface reference plane. The stepper performs tilt correction for the surface reference plane of the wafer surface to be perpendicular to an incident direction of irradiation light for exposure. It is possible to suppress the occurrence of defocus, since the light exposure is performed in a state of reducing the height difference in the wafer surface with respect to the surface reference plane.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">Even though the surface of the Si wafer is tilted, the surface itself is almost flat. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of defocus through the tilt correction. However, in the SiC wafer, since “waviness” exists on the surface, a portion outside the range of the DOF is generated by simply performing the tilt correction, which causes the defocus.</div>

The semiconductor wafer satisfies a condition that a waviness value is equal to or smaller than 1 micrometer. The waviness value is defined as flatness of a surface of the epitaxial layer acquired by a surface shape measurement device, and the waviness value is a sum of an absolute value of a value α and an absolute value of a value β. The highest height among respective heights of multiple points with reference to a surface reference plane within a light exposure area is denoted as the value α. The lowest height among the respective heights of the multiple points at the epitaxial layer with reference to the surface reference plane within the light exposure area is denoted as the value β. The surface reference plane is acquired by the surface shape measurement device through: a measurement of the respective heights of the points within an evaluation area; and a calculation of a least squares method based on the respective heights. The light exposure area is different from the evaluation area. A center position of the light exposure area is identical to a center position of the evaluation area, and a range of the light exposure area is different from a range of the evaluation area.</div>

A center position of the light exposure area is identical to a center position of the evaluation area, and a range of the light exposure area is different from a range of the evaluation area. In evaluating the flatness of the surface of the epitaxial layer, the surface shape measurement device measures respective heights of multiple points at the epitaxial layer within the evaluation area, determines a surface reference plane for the epitaxial layer through a calculation of a least-squares method based on the measured respective heights of the multiple points within the evaluation area, and evaluates a waviness value within the light exposure area. The semiconductor wafer is adopted, in a condition that the waviness value is equal to or smaller than 1 micrometer. The waviness value is a sum of an absolute value of a value α and an absolute value of a value β.
