For example, microfluidic devices in the form of so-called “lab-on-a-chip” systems are used for medical or, in general terms, biotechnology applications. Accordingly, such microfluidic devices are sometimes also referred to as microfluidic chips. It is furthermore known to use microfluidic devices in the form of so-called flow cells, for example for diagnostic purposes, and specifically for DNA sequencing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a microfluidic device usually comprises a first substrate, for example made of glass, quartz or silicon, having a surface in which one or more recesses are provided, the recess(es) forming one or more cavities and/or channels. Suitable chemicals, electrodes, etc. can be arranged in the cavities and/or channels according to the particular function of the microfluidic device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The cavities and/or channels are usually closed toward the top by a “cover” in the form of a second substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Within the scope of the present description, information such as “toward the top,” “upper,” “on,” “toward the bottom,” “lower,” etc. merely represents relative information that denotes spatial relationships of different components with respect to one another once a reference system has been established, but does not define an absolute orientation in the space.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The termination of the cavities and/or channels by the second substrate in particular has to be fluid-tight (at least in sections). In the application, for example, an analyte may then be pushed through the channels, and the corresponding analysis can be carried out.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The first substrate and/or the second substrate may be provided in the form of a wafer (e.g., made of glass or silicon) or as part of such a wafer. In this case, the two wafers can be glued together, for example, using so-called wafer bonding, thereby closing the channel toward the top in the fluid conduction part by means of the closure part.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, during the so-called adhesive bonding, an areal connection is created between two wafers (such as glass wafers) by means of a thin adhesive film. This form of joining technique is used in particular in the case of components that must not be exposed to elevated temperatures in subsequent process steps, e.g., because metals or biological functional structures are already present, which do not tolerate a higher temperature budget.</div>

Such a method does not require any adhesive or other intermediate layers. Instead, the attachment is based on chemical bonds between the surfaces, such as van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds or strong covalent bonds.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">A prerequisite for this is that the surfaces involved are sufficiently clean, flat and smooth. In particular, the surfaces must not include any excessively large particles or protrusions. In other words, the surfaces must have an extremely low surface roughness, for example of less than 0.5 nm, in order to enable direct bonding. Any particle having a particle diameter of 0.5 nm or more may result in non-contact sites (also referred to as flaws or “voids”) between the surfaces involved, wherein a diameter of the non-contact sites is usually larger than the particle diameter by approximately a factor of 10,000. For example, a 100 nm particle having a particle diameter of 100 nm may result in a void having a diameter of approximately 1 mm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">Due to the above-described high requirements with regard to the properties of the substrate surfaces, the direct bonding of wafers, in particular glass wafers, to structured surfaces at the bond interface is generally not possible. In such cases, alternative bonding techniques, such as the aforementioned adhesive bonding, are thus commonly employed, which are capable of burying the steps of the structures or otherwise preventing voids from forming around the structures.</div>

However, such a procedure, if it were applied to the creation of metallic structures in microfluidic devices, would not readily result in a sufficiently smooth surface that would allow direct bonding to another substrate.
