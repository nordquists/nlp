<div class="description-paragraph">METHOD OF POLISHING GALLIUM ARSBNIDE SINGLE CRYSTALS BY REACTION WITH A GASEOUS ATMOSPHERE INCOMPLETELY SATURATED WITH GALLIUM Filed July 12, 1965 INVENTORS GUNTER HELLBARDT MICHAEL M ICHELITSCH Mmm/ ATTORNEY United States Patent 1 Claims. oi. 148175) This invention relates to a method of effecting chemical fine polishing of single crystals. More specifically it relates to a method of effecting chemical fine polishing of GaAs single-crystal wafers in the production of semiconductor components. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When fabricating semiconductor components, it is necessary that the surfaces of the semiconductor singlecrystal wafers used as the starting elements be polished to a very high degree of fineness preparatory to doping or coating. Polishing is effected partly by mechanical, partly by chemical means in several successive polishing steps producing an increasing degree of fineness. In addition to the geometric nature of the surfaces being polished, their chemical nature is of decisive importance for the subsequent steps in producing semiconductor components. The chemical nature relates to the degree of contamination present. The absolute absence of all contamination is most desirable and to this end the surfaces being polished must be cleansed, rinsed and dried very carefully between the individual polishing steps and especially after the last polishing step. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In such operations, it is frequently difficult or even impossible to avoid oxidation or other contamination of the polished surfaces. The expedients used for avoiding oxidation or other contamination are liable to complicate the fabrication process or cause a deterioration in the quality of the semiconductor components. Thus, one polishing step has in many cases been performed by etching in an HI, HBr or HCl stream. Although the technique has been successful in avoiding a contamination of the polished surfaces to a great extent, the degree of fineness of the treated surfaces obtained thereby has not been good enough for many applications. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a method of chemically fine polishing gallium arsenide semiconductor material which is superior to prior art methods. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object is to provide a method of polishing gallium arsenide which avoids the necessity for subsequent mechanical polishing and is free from oxygen and other contaminants. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object is to provide a method of polishing gallium arsenide which by varying conditions in the various steps thereof permits epitaxial deposition. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another object is to provide a method of polishing gallium arsenide chemically which produces smoother and more planar semiconductors than prior art methods. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another object is to provide a method of chemically polishing gallium arsenide which results in gallium arsenide wafers having a high degree of fineness, i.e. an extremely small roughness depth and waviness, which preferably can be carried out in 'an arrangement designed for performing subsequent fabrication steps, so that it is possible not only to reduce the necessary equipment and required time but also to avoid oxidation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A feature of this invention is the utilization in the method of polishing GaAs single crystals of the step of undersaturating a mixture of gallium, arsenic, hydrogen and a hydrogen halide with gallium in the presence of ice GaAs wafers over a temperature range sufficient to cause polishing of said wafers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another feature of this invention is the utilization of a method wherein the step of undersaturating a mixture of gallium, arsenic, hydrogen and hydrogen halide includes the step of reacting gaseous hydrogen and a hydrogen halide having given flow rates with liquid gallium of a predetermined surface area to produce a vapor of hydrogen, a hydrogen halide and gallium. Also included is the step of vaporizing arsenic in the presence of hydrogen flowing over the arsenic at a given flow rate to produce a vapor of hydrogen and arsenic. Finally, the step of mixing the vapors to produce a mixture of hydrogen, hydrogen halide, gallium and arsenic undersaturated with gallium is utilized. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another feature is the utilization of the step of under-. saturating a gaseous mixture of gallium, arsenic, hydrogen and a hydrogen halide with gallium in the presence of GaAs wafers in a temperature range of 750850 C. to cause chemical fine polishing of the wafers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another feature is the utilization of a method wherein the step of undersaturating the gaseous mixture includes the steps of reacting gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen chloride flowing at rates of 25 cmfi/min. and cm. /min. respectively with liquid gallium having a range of surface areas greater than 3 cm. but less than 6 cm. in a temperature range of 690-710 C. to produce a vapor of hydrogen, hydrogen chloride and gallium. Also included are the steps of vaporizing arsenic in the presence of hydrogen flowing over arsenic at a rate of 70 cm. /min. in a temperature range of 440460 C. to produce a vapor of hydrogen and arsenic and, mixing the wafers to produce a mixture of hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, gallium and arsenic undersaturated with gallium. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another feature is the utilization of a method of polishing GaAs single crystals which includes the steps of introducing suitably prepared Wafers of single crystal GaAs into polishing apparatus; reacting gaseous hydrogen and a hydrogen halide at predetermined flow rates with liquid gallium which has a predetermined range of surface areas over a temperature range sufficient to produce a vapor of hydrogen and a hydrogen halide undersaturated with gallium; flowing gaseous hydrogen at a given flow rate over arsenic over a temperature range sufiicient to produce a vapor of arsenic and hydrogen; mixing the vapor undersaturated with gallium with the vapor of arsenic and hydrogen and reacting the mixed vapors with GaAs crystals over a predetermined range of temperature to cause fine polishing of a surface of the GaAs wafers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Yet another feature is the further step of increasing the predetermined surface area of the liquid gallium to a surface area greater than the predetermined surfaces area so that epitaxial deposition of gallium arsenide occurs due to oversaturation of the hydrogen, hydrogen halide vapor with gallium. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of a preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawing wherein: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The sole figure is an elevation view of polishing-deposition apparatus utilized in carrying out the method of the present invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The present invention provides a method of effecting chemical fine polishing, preferably chemical fine polishing of GaAs single-crystal waters in the fabrication of semiconductor components, which is characterized in that the composition of the etchant is preferably, by the controllable addition of suitable substances, approximated to the composition of the compound or mixture by saturating the etchant with one or more of the components of the body "tobe polished or with compounds containing such comgrowing step or doping step or vice versa is respectively effected by changing the concentration of the substances containedin the etching or transport gas, by adding substances promoting or retarding the precipitationof said substances, by changing the temperature, the pressure, etc., </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">or by a predetermined combination of such measures. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with a further, particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention for effecting chemical fine polishing of GaAs, a gas mixture consisting of H01 flowing at 25 cm. /min. and H flowing at 70 cm. /min. is directed across a gallium area of 4 cm. heated to 7001- 10 C. and H flowing at 70 cm. /min. is, directed across an arsenic area heated to 45 01 10 C., the two streams being thereafter mixed and subsequently directed across the GaAs wafer to be polished which has been heated to a temperature of 750850 C., preferably 800-825 C. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to the figure there is shown an elevation view of the apparatus utilized in carrying out the method of the present invention. Mounted in the tube 1, which is connected via conduits 5 and 6 to tubes 2 and 3, is a slide 8 on which GaAs single-crystal wafers 7 are placed. The GaAs single-crystal wafers 7 are of the N conductivity type and are to be covered by epitaxial growth with a P- type layer of GaAs. First, however, it is necessary to reduce the surface roughness of the mechanically prepolished and carefully cleansed wafers by chemical polishing. For that purpose, vessels 22 and 23 are disposed internally of tubes 2 and 3. The vessel 23 is connected via a capillary tube 25 to a supply container 24 containing liquid gallium. The vessel 23 is formed so that, depending on the level of the liquid, the surface of the liquid substance accommodated therein covers an area of between 3 cm. and 6 cm. The vessel 22 contains pure arsenic which is maintained at a temperature of 450il0 C. The tube 2 is passed by H which transports vaporous arsenic through the conduit 6 into the tube 1. Under the stated conditions, the partial vapor pressure of the arsenic is approximately torr. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The vessel 23 contains liquid gallium which is maintained at a temperature of 700i10 C. The level of the liquid in the vessel 23, which is connected via the conduit 25 to the supply container 24, is adjusted by displacing the piston 26 so that the surface of the liquid gallium covers an area of 4 cm. Heating of the containers 22, 23 and 24 as well of the GaAs Wafers 7 is effected by a furnace indicated by means of the coil 27. The tubes 1, 2 and 3 have a diameter of 18 mm., the over-all system having a length of 50 cm. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> HCl is passed through the tube 3 at 25 cm. /min. and H at 70 cm. min. and transport gallium in the form of vapor through the conduit 5 into the tube 1. By means of the furnace indicated by the coil 27, the temperature of the GaAs single-crystal wafer 7 is maintained at approximately 800-825 C. With the above indicated temperature and flow conditions prevailing, the HCl-H mixture is undersaturated with gallium, which results in an abrasion of the N-doped GaAs single-crystal wafers 7 and thus in the surfaces of said wafers being polished. The less the undersaturation of the HCl-H mixture with gallium, the slower is the abrasion of the wafers 7 and the smaller is the roughness depth and the better the smoothness of these single crystals, which incidentally are cut along a (111) plane. The degree of saturation of the HCl-H mixtufe depends on the size of the surface of the liquid gallium 7 contained in the vess el 3 t he size of that surface being adjustable by displacing the piston 26. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On completion of the chemical polishing step, which is readily observed through the window 4, the surface of the liquid gallium which is P doped, in the vessel 23 is increased to an area of "6 cm? which results in an oversaturation of thejHQl-H mixt ure' with P-doped gallium, so thatan epitaxial P-doped GaAs layer is precipitated on the surfaces of the wafer l t It may also bedesirable to provide a plurality of vessels and supply containers with differentially doped substances, so that it is possible to grow epitaxially a plurality of alternately N and P. dopedlayer-s on the wafer .7. Also so-called heterojunctions may be produced in this manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' In order to avoid the necessity of interrupting the process after'each polishing'and coating step, a tube 10 is provided which is connected via-a conduit 14 to the tube 1. A support 11 which is mounted in the tube 10 in a manner to 'belongitudinally displaceable and rotatable has slots 13 which'respectivelyreceive a GaAs water. After the processing of the respective'wafers "7 mounted on the support 8 has been completed, the support'S is moved rearward sufiicie'ntly for the wafers 7' to drop through the channel 15 into the supply container 16 when the support is rotated. Then the support 11 is displaced longitudinally and rotatedfor feeding a corresponding number of GaAs wafers contained in the slots 13 through the channel 14 onto the support 8, whereafter the process is repeated. The inner diameter of the tube 10 is adapted to the dimensions of the wafers 7 so that only the respective wafer overlying the channel 14 can drop out of a slot 13. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the course of the above described .process, the following reactions take place: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It should be appreciated that a distinction exists between etching and polishing. In the former instance, the action of one substance on another is preferential to the extent that certain areas having certain crystallographic axes or chemical composition are attacked, rather than areas having different orientations 'or chemical composition. Etch ing can generally be accomplished with relative ease under a wide set of conditions and in the semiconductor art is generally undesirable if it meets the criterion of preferential etching. In the latter instance, non-preferential etching is the criterion. Under such circumstances all areas of the treated semiconductor are acted upon in the same manner such that a smooth surface without pitting or deformation is obtained. Polishing to produce a smooth, uncontaminated surface is difiicult to attain and conditions of temperature, pressure, flow rate, and the like may be varied only withinnarrow limits to obtain a polished surface such as is suitable for use in a subsequent epitaxial deposition step. Thus, the fact that one material may be characterized as being capable of etching another, such characterization does not indicate that'polishing can be attained unless the special conditions required for polishing are fulfilled. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in'the form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </div>
