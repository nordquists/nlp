<div class="description-paragraph">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/011,146 filed Jan. 29, 1993, now abandoned.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer which is useful for electronic devices and formation of integrated circuits, and a process for the production thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer comprising a monocrystalline semiconductor layer, and a process for production thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Related Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Formation of a thin monocrystalline semiconductor layer on an insulating layer is well known as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technique. The devices obtained from the wafer of the SOI structure are comprehensively investigated since the devices has many advantages which are not achievable by use of a bulk monocrystalline Si wafer for usual Si integrated circuits. Recent researches on the process for production of the above wafers are roughly classified into three types of processes as below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) processes comprising steps of oxidizing the surface of a monocrystalline Si substrate, forming partially an aperture in the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer to expose partially the monocrystalline Si substrate, and growing epitaxially monocrystalline Si in the lateral direction by utilizing the monocrystalline Si as the seed at the aperture portion to form a monocrystalline Si layer on the SiO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) processes utilizing the monocrystalline Si substrate itself as the active layer, which comprises a step of forming an SiO<sub>2</sub> layer under a surface monocrystalline Si layer of a monocrystalline Si substrate with retaining the surface monocrystalline Si layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) processes comprising steps of growing Si monocrystal epitaxially on a monocrystalline Si substrate, and carrying out an insulative separation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Neither of the SOI techniques give more than a single layer of a monocrystalline semiconductor layer on an insulating layer, and giving a device which utilizes a monocrystalline semiconductor layer two-dimensionally on the insulating layer.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor wafer in which the monocrystalline semiconductor layer on an insulation layer is utilized three-dimensionally, especially in a thickness direction, and to produce easily the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor wafer, comprising a plurality of non-porous monocrystal layers laminated with interposition of an insulating layer or insulating layers on a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a semiconductor wafer, comprising the steps of bonding a first intermediate laminate comprising a first tentative substrate of a porous monocrystalline semiconductor and a first monocrystalline semiconductor layer formed thereon on the first tentative substrate onto the surface of a substrate at the first monocrystalline semiconductor side, removing the first tentative substrate by etching, forming an insulating layer on the etched face, bonding a second intermediate laminate comprising a second tentative substrate of a porous monocrystalline semiconductor and a second monocrystalline semiconductor layer formed thereon onto the insulating layer at the second monocrystalline semiconductor side in the same manner as defined above, and removing the second tentative substrate by etching.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a vertical sectional view of a second embodiment of the semiconductor wafer of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 3A to 3E illustrate a process for producing a semiconductor wafer of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 4A and 4B are vertical sectional views of a third embodiment and a fourth embodiment of the semiconductor wafer of the present invention, respectively.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The semiconductor wafer of the first embodiment of the present invention comprises a plurality of non-porous monocrystal layers laminated with interposition of an insulating layer on a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A preferable process for producing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention comprises the steps of bonding a first intermediate laminate comprising a first tentative substrate of a porous monocrystalline semiconductor and a first monocrystalline semiconductor layer formed thereon onto the surface of a substrate at the first monocrystalline semiconductor side, removing the first tentative substrate by etching, forming an insulating layer on the etched face, bonding a second intermediate laminate comprising a second tentative substrate of a porous monocrystalline semiconductor and a second monocrystalline semiconductor layer formed thereon onto the insulating layer at the second monocrystalline semiconductor side in the same manner as mentioned above, and removing the second tentative substrate by etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate examples of the semiconductor wafer of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIGS. 1 and 2, a numeral 1 refers to the semiconductor wafer, numerals 2a and 2b denote insulating layers, and numerals 3a and 3b denote monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a, 3b.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The difference between the semiconductor wafers of FIG. 1 and the one of FIG. 2 is presence or absence of the insulating layer 2a. If the substrate 1 has sufficient insulating property, the insulating layer 2a need not be provided, as shown in FIG. 2. If not, on the contrary, an appropriate insulating layer 2a is preferably provided between the substrate 1 and the monocrystalline semiconductor layer 3a as shown in FIG. 1. The interposition of an insulating layer 2a (2b) between the substrate 1 and the monocrystal layers 3a, 3b enables three-dimensional utilization of the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a, 3b, for example, in a CMOS construction in a thickness direction, realizing higher integration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The material for the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a, 3b preferably includes monocrystalline Si and GaAs type of III-V group monocrystalline semiconductors because of ease of formation, but is not limited thereto. In the case where the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a, 3b are made of monocrystalline Si, the insulating layer 2a (2b) of SiO<sub>2</sub> can readily be formed, but other insulator material may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of the combination of the material for the layers are shown below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Embodiment shown in FIG. 1 (substrate 1/insulating layer 2a/monocrystalline semiconductor layer 3a/insulating layer 2b/monocrystalline semiconductor layer 3b):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A: monocrystalline Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">B: monocrystalline Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si/insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">C: monocrystalline Si/insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">D: monocrystalline Si/insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si/insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The "insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> " includes SiN, SiO<sub>2</sub> --SiN--SiO<sub>2</sub>, and the like. In particular, the dielectric constant and the stress between the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a and 3b can be controlled by suitably selecting the material of the insulating layer 2b provided between the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a and 3b, thereby the capacitive coupling being adjusted and the stress being relaxed. The monocrystalline Si in the above embodiment may be replaced by a GaAs type III-V group monocrystalline semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Embodiment shown in FIG. 2 (substrate 1/monocrystalline semiconductor layer 3a/insulating layer 2b/monocrystalline semiconductor layer 3b):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">E: silica glass/monocrystalline Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">F: silica glass/monocrystalline Si/insulator other than SiO<sub>2</sub> /monocrystalline Si</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The monocrystalline Si in the above embodiment may be replaced by a GaAs type III-V group monocrystalline semiconductor similarly as in the case (1) above. The substrate 1 may be made of borosilicate glass or the like. However, when the substrate 1 is made so, an insulating layer 2a is preferably provided as shown in FIG. 1 because the borosilicate is less insulating than silica glass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Two monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a and 3b are provided in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. Three or more monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a and 3b, etc. may be laminated with interposition of insulating layers 2b, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process for producing the aforementioned semiconductor wafer is described below mainly on lamination of monocrystalline Si layers. However, the present invention is not limited to the one employing monocrystalline Si as the monocrystalline semiconductor layers 3a and 3b.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 3A, a porous monocrystalline Si plate is prepared as a tentative substrate 14 by treating a monocrystalline Si plate for entire porousness. On the surface thereof, a monocrystalline Si is grown epitaxially to form a monocrystalline Si layer 13a.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tentative substrate 14 made of porous monocrystalline Si has pores of the average size of about 600 Å by observation with a transmission electron microscope. Although the density thereof is half or less than the density of monocrystalline Si, the monocrystallinity is retained, and epitaxial growth of monocrystalline Si is possible on the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, rearrangement of the pores occurs at a temperature above 1000° C., whereby the characteristics of enhanced etching is impaired.. Therefore, the epitaxial growth of monocrystalline Si is preferably conducted by a low temperature growth process such as molecular beam epitaxial growth, plasma CVD, thermal CVD, photo-assisted CVD, bias sputtering, liquid crystal growth, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The porousness treatment of P-type monocrystalline Si and subsequent epitaxial growth of monocrystalline Si are conducted as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Firstly, a monocrystalline Si plate is made porous by anodization by use of an HF solution. While the density of monocrystalline Si is 2.33 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the density of porous monocrystalline Si can be varied from 0.6 to 1.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> by varying the concentration of the HF solution in the range of from 20 to 50%. The porous monocrystalline Si is readily formed from P-type monocrystalline Si by the reasons below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The porous monocrystalline Si was found in the course of study on electropolishing of semiconductors in the year 1956. In the study of dissolving reaction of monocrystalline Si by anodization, it was disclosed that positive holes are required for anodic reaction of monocrystalline Si in an HF solution, and the reaction proceeds according to the formulas below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">Si+2HF+(2-n)e.sup.+ →SiF.sub.2 +2H.sup.+ +ne.sup.-</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">SiF.sub.2 +2HF→SiF.sub.4 +H.sub.2</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">SiF.sub.4 +2HF→H.sub.2 SiF.sub.6</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">or otherwise,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">Si+4HF+(4-λ)e.sup.+ →SiF.sub.4 +4H.sup.+ +λe.sup.-</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">SiF.sub.4 +2HF→H.sub.2 SiF.sub.6</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">where e<sup>+</sup> and e<sup>-</sup> represent respectively a positive hole and an electron; n and λ represent respectively the number of the positive holes required for dissolving one atom of monocrystalline Si, and it was also disclosed that porous monocrystalline Si is formed if n&gt;2, or λ&gt;4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, a P-type monocrystalline Si is considered to be readily made porous. This selectivity in porous structure formation has already been actually proved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, it was also revealed that high-concentration N-type monocrystalline Si can also be made porous. Therefore, the porous structure can be formed whether the structure is of P-type or of N-type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An example of the conditions for making monocrystalline Si porous by anodization are shown below. The starting material for porous Si by anodization is not limited to monocrystalline Si, but Si of other crystal structure may also be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Applied voltage: 2.6 (V)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Current density: 30 (mA.cm<sup>2</sup>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Anodization solution: HF:H<sub>2</sub> O:C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> OH=1:1:1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Time: 2.4 (hours)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thickness of porous monocrystalline Si: 300 (μm)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Porosity: 56%</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the porous monocrystalline Si formed thus as a tentative substrate 14, monocrystalline Si is made to grow epitaxially to form a thin monocrystalline Si layer 13a in a thickness preferably of not more than 50 μm, more preferably not more than 20 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 3B, the face of the monocrystalline Si layer 13a on the tentative substrate 14 is bonded onto a substrate 11. This bonding is preferably made after the surface of the monocrystalline Si layer 13a has been oxidized to form a surface SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 12a. This is because the interfacial energy level caused by the lower interface of the monocrystalline Si 13a can be made lower on the oxidized film interface than on the above glass interface, even if borosilicate glass is used as the substrate 11, thereby improving remarkably the performance of an electronic device. Otherwise, in the case where a monocrystalline Si layer 13a from which the tentative substrate 14 has been removed by selective etching as described later is bonded to the substrate 11, or in the case where the substrate 11 is monocrystalline Si, the surface thereof may be oxidized to form the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 12a.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The bonding can be made simply by washing the surfaces of the both and bringing them into contact at room temperature to be so strong by Van der Waals force that the bonded matter cannot be separated readily. However, it is preferred that the bonded matter is heat-treated further in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of from 200° to 900° C., more preferably from 600° to 900° C. to make the bonding complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The entire of the bonded tentative substrate 14 and the substrate 11 are covered with deposition of Si<sub>3</sub> N<sub>4</sub> layer 15 as an etching protection layer as shown in FIG. 3C. Then, the Si<sub>3</sub> N<sub>4</sub> layer 15 on the surface of the tentative substrate 14 only is removed. The Si<sub>3</sub> N<sub>4</sub> layer 15 may be replaced by Apiezon Wax.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the tentative substrate 14 composed of porous monocrystalline Si is entirely removed by etching or other procedure, thus giving the substrate 11 having one monocrystalline Si layer 13a as shown in FIG. 3D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The porous monocrystalline Si has a great number of voids formed in the inside thereof, having a density of half or less of the non-porous monocrystalline Si. Consequently, the surface area is greatly increased for the volume thereof, and chemical etching velocity is greatly accelerated in comparison with a normal monocrystal layer. Therefore, an etching solution can be used which is capable of etching both monocrystalline Si and porous monocrystalline Si. However, it is preferable to use an etching solution which exhibits weak or no etching activity to non-porous monocrystalline Si and etches preferentially porous monocrystalline Si.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The etching solution which does not etch non-porous monocrystalline Si but etches selectively porous monocrystalline Si includes hydrofluoric acid; buffered hydrofluoric acid such as a mixture of ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub> F) with hydrogen fluoride (HF); mixtures of hydrofluoric acid or a buffered hydrofluoric acid with a hydrogen peroxide solution; mixtures of hydrofluoric acid or a buffered hydrofluoric acid with an alcohol; and mixtures of hydrofluoric acid or a buffered hydrofluoric acid with a hydrogen peroxide solution and an alcohol. A tentative substrate 14 having a monocrystalline Si layer 13a formed thereon or a tentative substrate 14 bonded with a substrate 11 is etched by wetting with such a solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The etching rate depends on the concentration of hydrofluoric acid, buffered hydrofluoric acid, and hydrogen peroxide solution, and the temperature of the solution. The addition of a hydrogen peroxide solution accelerates oxidation of Si, thereby increasing the reaction rate compared to the rate of the solution free from hydrogen peroxide. The reaction rate can be controlled by changing the ratio of the hydrogen peroxide solution. The addition of an alcohol enables immediate removal, by agitation, of gas bubbles formed by the etching reaction from the etching surface, making the etching of the porous monocrystal Si uniform and efficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The concentration of HF in the buffered hydrofluoric acid is preferably in the range of from 1 to 95%, more preferably from 1 to 85%, still more preferably from 1 to 70% by weight of the etching solution. The concentration of NH<sub>4</sub> in the buffered hydrofluoric acid is preferable in the range of from 1 to 95%, preferably from 5 to 90%, still more preferably from 5 to 80% by weight of the etching solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The concentration of HF is preferably in the range of from 1 to 95%, more preferably from 5 to 90%, still more preferably from 5 to 80% by weight of the etching solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The concentration of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> is preferably in the range of from 1 to 95%, more preferably from 5 to 90%, still more preferably from 10 to 80% by weight of the etching solution, and is decided so as to attain the aforementioned effect of the hydrogen peroxide solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The concentration of the alcohol is preferably not higher than 80%, more preferably not higher than 60%, still more preferably not higher than 40% by weight of the etching solution, and is decided so as to attain the aforementioned effect of the alcohol. The alcohol includes ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and the like. Any alcohol may be used which does not practicably impede the production process and exhibits the aforementioned effect of alcohol addition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The etching temperature is preferably in the range of from 0° to 100° C., more preferably from 5 to 80° C., still more preferably from 5 to 60° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the present invention, another monocrystalline Si layer 13b is formed on another tentative substrate 14 in the same manner as above, and the face of this monocrystalline Si layer 13b is bonded to the face of the monocrystalline Si layer 13a formed on the substrate 11 in the manner as above with interposition of an SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 12b, as shown in FIG. 3E. This SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 12b is formed prior to the bonding by oxidation of the surface of the monocrystalline Si layer 13a or 13b. Thereafter, the tentative substrate 14 is removed by etching in the same manner as above to obtain a semiconductor wafer similar to the one shown in FIG. 1. The semiconductor as shown in FIG. 2 is provided in the same procedure without forming the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 12a. It is readily understood that three or more of monocrystalline Si layers can be laminated by repeating the lamination process described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above description, the tentative substrate 14 is prepared by making a monocrystalline Si plate entirely porous. However, a tentative substrate may be employed which has been prepared by making a monocrystal Si plate porous only at the surface of one side. In this case naturally, the epitaxial growth of the monocrystalline Si is allowed to proceed on the porous surface. After the bonding of this tentative substrate 14 having a monocrystal Si layer 13a (13b) onto the substrate 11, the tentative substrate 14 is removed by firstly polishing off the non-porous portion of the tentative substrate 14 and then etching off the porous portion thereof in the same manner as above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where a monocrystalline semiconductor of the GaAs type III-V group is employed in place of the monocrystalline Si, the lamination can be conducted readily as shown below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Firstly, a monocrystalline Si layer is formed on a tentative substrate, and on this monocrystalline Si layer, a monocrystalline semiconductor of GaAs type III-V group is grown epitaxially. Then the face of the monocrystalline semiconductor of GaAs type III-V group on the tentative substrate is bonded to a substrate or an insulating layer in the same manner as above, and the tentative substrate and the monocrystalline Si layer are removed by etching or other procedure, thus the monocrystalline semiconductor layer of GaAs type III-V group is laminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the procedure described above, another type of semiconductor wafer can readily be prepared which is constructed of a substrate 21 and monocrystalline semiconductor layers 23a and 23b on the both surfaces of the substrate as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. The one shown in FIG. 4A has monocrystalline semiconductor layer 23a and 23b formed on the both surfaces of the substrate 21 with interposition of insulation layers 22a and 22b, while the one shown in FIG. 4B has monocrystalline semiconductor layers 23a and 23b formed directly on both surfaces of an insulating substrate 21.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is described in more detail by reference to examples.</div>
