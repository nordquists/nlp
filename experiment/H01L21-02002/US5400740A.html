<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a method of preparing a compound semiconductor having a carrier-injection layer or an electrode-drawing layer, which is formed by a crystal regrowth method and a selective crystal growth method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For the purpose of improving the performance of a compound semiconductor device, the structure suitable for the shortening tendency of a channel has been investigated in an electron device, and also the side-joint structure fitted for the OEIC (Optoelectronic Integrated Circuit) has been investigated in a semiconductor laser. As an effective method to realize these structures, a self-alignment method of forming a carrier-injection layer or an electrode-drawing layer, by a crystal regrowth and a selective crystal growth methods, has been generally used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the surface of a substrate or an epitaxial growth layer is subjected to an impurity pollution or a physical damage, during the processes of exposure in the air, etching, washing and the like. Then, in case where a crystal regrowth is directly effected on these surfaces as they are, the performance or the life time of a device will be exceedingly deteriorated. For that reason, the cleaning of the surface and the removal of the damaged layer have been executed in a crystal growth chamber by a vapor phase etching method, successively followed by effecting the crystal regrowth procedure. The compound semiconductor device prepared by such method, however, poses a problem that the carrier will be stored on the regrowth surface as shown in FIG. 1, though the purity of the surface will be improved.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the inventors have devoted themselves to overcome the above problem, and have reached the present invention as will be explained in the following steps:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Firstly, the inventors assumed that in case of a usual compound semiconductor, for example, the III-V group compound semiconductor, the chlorides of III-group and V-group elements would be formed on the surface by introducing, for example, a chlorine-series etching gas, and the etching would be proceeded by an evaporation of these chlorides into a vapor phase, and then, a stoichiometric discrepancy between III-group and V-group would occur on the gas-etched surface, thereby bringing about a carrier storing in the crystal regrowth interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Secondly, the inventors found out that a plain profile without the carrier storing on the regrowth interface could be obtained, by flowing the III-group organic metals gas and/or hydrides containing V-group elements, or the V-group organic metals gas during the gas-etching, in order to solve the above carrier storing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing a semiconductor device, which gives at the same time both performances in an improved purity of the recrystallization-interface and in the stabilization of the carrier-concentration disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The object, in accordance with the present invention, can be achieved, by a method of preparing a compound semiconductor which comprises introducing the hydrides III-group organic metals gas and/or hydrides containing V-group elements, or the V-group organic metals gas into a crystal growth chamber, in addition to the carrier gas and the etching gas, in a method of preparing a III-V group compound semiconductor including the process to effect the gas etching of a single crystal substrate surface and a single crystal thin-film surface in the crystal growth chamber, just before the vapor phase growth of a compound semiconductor thin-film is carried out, using the hydrides and the organic metals gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the object can be preferably achieved, by the above method of preparing a compound semiconductor crystal, wherein a compound semiconductor thin-film will be allowed to be regrown or selectively grown, on the mesa-shape substrate or the epitaxial layer formed by a gas-etching in the growth chamber. Further, the object can be preferably achieved, by the above method of preparing a compound semiconductor crystal and by the compound semiconductor obtained thereby, wherein a gas containing halogen elements will be used, as the gas used in the vapor phase etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be explained in detail below. The III-V group compound semiconductors to be used in the present invention are not specifically limited, if these are conventionally used as a semiconductor device, and GaAs, GaAlAs, InP, InAsP, InSaAsP and the like are concretely used. The hydrides and the organic metals gas are not also particularly limited, and these may be selected from the ones with which a desired compound semiconductor will be obtained. For example, in case of GaAs, arsine (AsH<sub>3</sub>) or phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>) are used as the hydride, and trimethyl gallium (TMG), triethyl gallium (TEG), trimethyl aluminum (TMA), triethyl aluminum (TEA), trimethyl indium (TMI) and the like are usually used as the organic metals gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with the present invention, it is featured that the III-group organic metals gas and/or hydrides containing V-group elements, or the V-group organic metals gas will be flowed cocurrently with a carrier gas and an etching gas, at the time the etching for the cleaning of growth surface is effected in a crystal growth chamber, immediately before the vapor phase growth of the compound semiconductor thin-film, using the aforementioned hydrides and organic metals gas. The organic metals gas and/or the hydrides used at this time are not specially limited, provided that these contain the III-group and/or the V-group elements composing the compound to be grown by a vapor phase growth method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a more preferable mode for working the instant invention, especially in case of the doping immediately after the gas-etching, the III-group organic metals gas will be introduced, when the dopants to enter the III-group site are employed, and also the hydrides containing the V-group elements or the V-group organic metals gas will be introduced, when the dopants to enter the V-group site are employed. By this operation, the storing of dopant in a hetero junction interface will be decreased. For instance, in case of the silicon doping, the III-group organic metals gas is preferably used and TMG or TEG is concretely used. In case of the selenium doping, the hydrides containing the V-group elements or the V-group organic metals gas are preferably used and arsine is concretely used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The carrier gas is not especially limited providing that it bas been commonly used so far, and hydrogen is concretely used. Also, the etching gas is not limited if it has been usually used. A gas containing halogen elements is preferable, a chlorine series reactive gas is more preferable, and at least one member selected from the group consisting of HCl, CCl<sub>2</sub> F<sub>2</sub>, AsCl<sub>3</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub> is most preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The etching condition is not limited, but 500°-800° C. of temperature is usually used so as to enhance the etching speed. The introducing amount of the etching gas and the organic gas varies to a great extent, according to the size of crystal growth chamber and the performance of desired semiconductor device, and in general, more etching gas than the organic metals gas will be introduced. Also, since the etching speed will be lowered according to the reduction of temperature, the amount of the etching gas may be increased in case of low temperatures. The total pressure of the gas to be flowed is preferably at normal pressure or less.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be explained in more detail, by reference to the following Example in connection with the drawings. The present invention is by no means limited to the Example, without departing from the spirit and the scope thereof.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this Example, as a raw material in the case where the growth is effected using a Metal-Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxial growth (hereinafter refer to as MOVPE) method, TMG (trimethyl gallium) and AsH<sub>3</sub> (arsine) were used, and as an etching gas, HCl (hydrogen chloride) was used. On the Si-dope GaAs substrate [100], 0.5 μm of Si-dope GaAs layer (n=1×10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) and 1.5 μm of Si-dope GaAs layer (n=1×10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) were epitaxially grown by using a reduced pressure (76 Torr) MOVPE method. This wafer was drawn out of the MOVPE reaction-furnace, and left exposed in an atmosphere for 12 hours. Then the wafer was returned back to the reaction-furnace, and 0.5 μm of Si-dope GaAs layer (n=1×10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) was regrown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Before the regrowth, the vapor phase etching by 0.3 μm in thickness of the wafer surface was conducted with hydrogen chloride gas in the MOVPE reaction-furnace. Si the dopant entered the III-group site, and then, TMG of the III-group organic metal gas was used together with an etching gas. The carrier-concentration distribution in the direction of depth was measured by C--V method, regarding the regrown wafer in both cases where TMG was flowed A) and TMG was not flowed (sample B) during the vapor etching, and the measurement result is shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of sample C, when the growth was effected as it was, without the vapor etching in the reaction-furnace prior to the regrowth, a large depletion of the carrier-concentration on the regrowth interface was noticed as shown in FIG. 3. This depletion part was a high resistant layer, which exerted such large effect as caused a thyristor phenomenon on a device performance. In case where TMG was not flowed during the vapor etching, the storing of carrier was noticed on the regrown interface. To the contrary, in case where TMG was flowed, a flat profile was obtained. The flowing of AsH<sub>3</sub> during this etching gave the decreasing of etching grade, along with the increasing of the AsH<sub>3</sub> flowing amount, but the storing of carrier-concentration was not dependent on the AsH<sub>3</sub> flowing amount. The flowing gave no change of the etching grade, but gave an effect to the suppression of the carrier storing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, a profile of the mobility in the direction of depth was measured on the samples A and B. In the sample B, the mobility was greatly lowered, but in the sample A, the mobility nearby the regrown interface was noticed to be lowered. The planarization of carrier profile in the sample A was not due to the compensation of p-type impurities, but a high-quality regrown interface was found to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the SINS analysis of these samples was run. As shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, the impurity peaks of oxygen, carbon, silicon and the like, which were noticed in the sample C regrown without a vapor etching, were not found. But it was recognized that a pure regrown interface was obtained by effecting a vapor etching, though TMG was not flowed during the vapor etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It can be considered, from the fact mentioned above, that whether the carrier will be stored or not, in case of the vapor etching, is related to the discrepancy of the stoichiometry on the vapor etching surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As stated above, in accordance with the present invention, the impurity pollution, the oxide film, the thermometamorphism layer and the like in the interface between a single crystal substrate and an epitaxial layer, and also in the regrown interface, which have been the problem up to this time, can be removed by effecting a vapor etching, flowing the hydrides containing III-group organic metals gas and/or V-group elements, or the V-group organic metals gas, immediately before a compound semiconductor thin-film is grown. As a result, a high quality regrown interface having the purified surface and causing no storing or no shortage of the carrier can be obtained, thus making it possible to greatly improve the performance as compared with the device prepared by a conventional method.</div>
