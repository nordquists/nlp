<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a wafer processing method and an equipment therefor, in particular, to a method for finishing the chamfered peripheral portion of a wafer and a finishing equipment therefor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally, a wafer processing method comprising the steps of; chamfering a peripheral portion of a wafer for preventing the peripheral portion from being chipped off, lapping for making variation in thickness of wafers small, etching for removing a cracked layer and contaminated portions which were formed by abrasive grains sticking thereunto or the like, and mirror-polishing the chamfered peripheral portion and the main surface of the wafer, sequentially, is known. A method in which the order of the chamfering and lapping steps is reversed to that of the above-described method, is also known, as described in "Semiconductor Material Basic Engineering" published by Nikkan Kogyo Newspaper Publishing Company on Feb. 28, 1994. However, in the latter method, because the peripheral portion of the wafer remains edged when lapping, there are the danger of occurrence of the peripheral portion being chipped off during lapping and further the danger of the main surface of the wafer being scratched by broken silicon pieces or the like. Therefore, the method comprising a lapping step after a chamfering step, such as the former, is recently on the main stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There is another method as a modified example of the former, in which the chamfering step comprises a first grinding step for grinding to round and chamfer the peripheral portion of the wafer by using a grinding stone having large grain size (e.g., #800) and a second grinding step for grinding the chamfered portion by using a grinding stone having small grain size (e.g., #1500) just after the first grinding step. According to the method, the smoothness of the chamfered portion is a little degraded in a following etching step. However, because the smoothness thereof after the etching step is better than the case using only a grinding stone having large grain size, it is possible to easily carry out the work in a following polishing step for the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in a method in which a lapping step is carried out after a chamfering step, there are some problems, that is, because the shape in plan or in section of the chamfered portion is got out of shape, and there is no opportunity to compensate the deformation of the shape, the deformed wafer as it is, is sent to a step for manufacturing semiconductor devices. Consequently, there is a problem that resist material to be removed remains on the peripheral portion of the wafer, in a photo-lithography step, and such a problem has contributed to the prevention of higher integration of semiconductor devices which will be required more and more in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, in a conventional etching step which was carried out just after a lapping step, the so-called acid etching, i.e., an etching in which the wafer was immersed in a liquid mixture of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid, or the like, was carried out. However, because acid etching has defects that it is difficult to keep the flatness of the wafer after lapping and that high costs are required for processing the waste of the used etching liquid, recently, alkali etching, i.e., an etching in which the wafer was immersed in a liquid of sodium hydroxide, a liquid of potassium hydroxide or the like, has been mostly used, instead of acid etching. Because alkali etching is anistropic and is different from acid etching which is isotropic, when alkali etching is utilized, in particular, the rear surface or the periphery of the wafer is roughened, so that the smoothness of the wafer is degraded. Therefore, a further processing for the rear surface or the chamfered portion of the wafer is required. Particularly, there is a problem that the processing for the latter chamfered portion after alkali etching requires much time for processing the surface to have a roughness less than a predetermined value, to obtain the target smoothness, which is several times that of acid etching. When an alkali etching is utilized, in the step of polishing the surfaces of the wafer, a method to improve the smoothness of the rear surface of the wafer, in which a wafer is set on a carrier and the front and rear surfaces of the wafer are simultaneously polished by buffs which are set on lapping plates arranged in upper and lower sides of the wafer, is also carried out. However, in such a polishing for the front and rear surfaces of the wafer, some problems, that is, the chamfered portion of the wafer is shaved by the inner wall of the carrier to make the sectional shape of the chamfered portion get out of shape, and thereby in a photo-lithography step in the following manufacturing process of semiconductor devices, resist material to be removed remains on the peripheral portion of the wafer, may be encountered. Therefore, these problems have contributed to the prevention of higher integration of semiconductor devices.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention was developed in view of the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a wafer processing method which can contribute to higher integration of semiconductor devices and can polish the chamfered portion of a wafer quickly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the processing method comprises the steps of: chamfering a peripheral portion of a wafer obtained by slicing an ingot, by grinding; lapping the wafer; etching the chamfered or lapped wafer; thereafter compensating a deformation in a sectional shape of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, which was generated in the lapping or etching step; and polishing the entirety of the compensated chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to such a processing method, it is possible to compensate the deformed plan and sectional shapes of the chamfered portion before sending to a step for manufacturing semiconductor devices. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the possibility of resist material being not clearly cut in the step for manufacturing semiconductor devices. In particular, even in the case of the smoothness of the periphery of the wafer being degraded by an alkali etching, the compensating step performed after the etching step can recover or remove the smoothness of the periphery to some extent. Thereby, it is possible to shorten the time required for a following polishing step for the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compensating step may comprise a honing step for honing the entirety of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer by using a honing stone while applying a predetermined load to the honing stone. Preferably, the lapping step is carried out after the chamfering step, and the wafer processing method further comprises a step for polishing front and rear surfaces of the wafer after the compensating step. Preferably, the lapping step is carried out after the chamfering step, and the wafer processing method further comprises a step for polishing front and rear surfaces of the wafer simultaneously after the etching step and before the compensating step, and a step for polishing the front surface of the wafer after the compensating step. The etching is preferably an alkali etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the above-described means, because the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer is honed before polishing the chamfered peripheral portion, it is possible to extremely shorten the time required for processing the surface of the chamfered portion to have a roughness less than a predetermined value, to obtain the target smoothness, and also to set right the sectional shape of the chamfered portion which was got out of shape in a previous step. According to the lapping step being carried out after the chamfering step, it is possible to reduce the danger of occurrence of the peripheral portion being chipped off during lapping and the danger of the main surface of the wafer being scratched by broken silicon pieces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compensating step may be carried out by grinding the peripheral chamfered portion of the wafer. Preferably, the lapping step is carried out after the chamfering step, and the wafer processing method further comprises a step for polishing front and rear surfaces of the wafer after the compensating step. The lapping step may be carried out after the chamfering step, and the wafer processing method further may comprise a step for polishing front and rear surfaces of the wafer simultaneously after the etching step and before the compensating step.</div>

<heading>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 shows the first embodiment of the wafer processing method of the invention. In this embodiment, a chamfered portion honing and polishing steps are adopted for compensating the deformation in a sectional shape of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, which was generated in the preceding step, that is, lapping, etching, or both surfaces polishing steps. As shown in this Figure, the wafer processing method according to the embodiment comprises a chamfering step, a lapping step, an etching step, a both surfaces polishing step, a chamfered portion honing and polishing step, and a front surface polishing step, which are sequentially performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Chamfering step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The peripheral portion of a wafer which was obtained by slicing an ingot by using an inner diameter saw slicing machine or a wire saw slicing machine, is ground to round by using a grinding stone while supplying a grinding fluid. The reason for this is that if the peripheral portion of the wafer remains edged, there are the danger of occurrence of the peripheral portion being chipped off during processing or occurrence of Si chips, and such dangers can contribute to the poor performance of an integrated circuit. The grain size of the grinding stone used for the chamfering step is not limited, however, and is preferably about #300 to #800. The bond for the grinding stone in this case is not particularly limited, however, and a metal bond is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Lapping step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One or both of the front and rear surfaces of the wafer for which the chamfering step was completed, are lapped by using a slurry containing abrasive grain, e.g., silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) or the like, and an additive such as a fatty acid salt or the like, under a pressure. Although thickness and degree of parallelization of a wafer are determined by cutting the ingot by using the inner diameter saw or the wire saw slicing machine, there are some variations necessarily in practice. This lapping step is for compensating such variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Etching step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An etching for the surfaces of the wafer is carried out by immersing the wafer in a liquid of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like. On the surfaces of the obtained wafer to which the lapping step was performed, a cracked layer (a cracked and roughened portions) or contaminated portions (portions into which abrasive grains stick) exist. This etching step is for removing those portions. In order to accomplish the purpose, although not only such an alkali etching but also an acid etching can be used. Preferably, an alkali etching is used to easily keep the flatness of the wafer after lapping and to reduce the cost for processing the waste of the used etching liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Both surfaces polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer is set on a carrier and the front and rear surfaces of the wafer are simultaneously polished by buffs which are set on lapping plates arranged in upper and lower sides of the wafer, while supplying an abrasive liquid. The both surfaces polishing step is for improving the flatness of the wafer extremely and for improving the smoothness of the rear surface to prevent occurrence of Si chips. When an alkali etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is preferably carried out. On the contrary, when an acid etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is not essential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) Chamfered portion honing and polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Honing, that is, processing to grind the entirety of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer by a honing stone while applying a predetermined load to the honing stone and supplying a grinding fluid, is carried out. This step is for compensating the deformation in a sectional shape of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, which was generated in the preceding step, that is, for improving the smoothness and the sectional shape of the chamfered portion to some extent, which were damaged by the preceding lapping, etching, and both surfaces polishing steps. The bond for the honing stone in this case is not particularly limited, however, a vitrified bond of ceramic raw material system, a metal bond, a resin bond, a metal-resin mixture bond, gum or the like is preferably used. Accordingly, it is possible to improve not only the smoothness of the surfaces but the ability to set right the sectional shape of the chamfered portion which was got out of shape in previous lapping and etching steps. Thereafter, the entirety of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer is polished by a buff or the like while supplying an abrasive liquid. This step is for removing residual strain in the just surface layer due to the honing, for preventing generation of chips or fine particles of silicon in the middle of a following step for manufacturing a device by smoothness, and for solving the problem that resist material to be removed remains on the peripheral portion of the wafer, in a photo-lithography step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) Front surface polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The front surface of the wafer is polished by a buff while supplying an abrasive liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a first embodiment of a chamfered portion processing equipment used for the above-described method will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, a processing equipment for honing and polishing the chamfered portion of the wafer is shown in FIG. 2. The processing equipment 101 comprises a chamfered portion honing apparatus 102 and a chamfered portion polishing apparatus 103.

In the processing equipment 101, the wafer W is sent to the positioning part (B) by the loader 120. The wafer W which was positioned there is transferred to the notch honing part (C), the periphery honing part (D), the notch polishing part (E), the periphery polishing part (F), and the cleaning part (G), continuously, by a transfer device 140 as shown in FIG. 5, which is provided in the processing equipment 101.</div>

The loader 120 has a construction in which the wafer W at the bottom position is taken out of the cassette 104 by the belt conveyor 120a in turn and is sent to the positioning part (B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The transfer device 140 is provided with an arm 140a, as shown in FIG. 5, which can be reciprocally moved toward the arrangement of the positioning part (B), the notch honing part (C), the periphery honing part (D), the notch polishing part (E), the periphery polishing part (F), and the wafer cleaning part (G). On the lower side of the top end of the arm 140a, an absorption disc 140b is provided. The absorption disc 140b is communicated with a vacuum pump which is not shown, through an air pipe (not shown), so that a wafer W can be held on the lower surface of the absorption disc 140b by vacuum suction. The absorption disc 140b can be rotated by a motor 140c.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The notch honing device 121 comprises a honing stone 121a, as shown in FIG. 2. The honing stone 121a is supported by a pair of arms 121b and 121b. In the notch honing device 121, the honing stone 121a can be rotated by a motor which is not shown. Honing for the notch portion N of the wafer W is carried out by pressing the periphery of the honing stone 121a against the notch portion N of the wafer W while giving relative reciprocal rotation between the wafer W and the honing stone 121a within a small angle. In order to carry out the honing, the honing stone 121a can come near or separate from the wafer W. During the honing, the honing stone 121a is pressed against the notch portion N of the wafer W with a predetermined load.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The periphery honing device 122 is provided with two cylindrical honing stones 122a, as shown in FIG. 6. On a peripheral surface of each honing stone 122a, a groove 122b which is the so-called form chamfering groove, for receiving the periphery of a wafer W is provided. Each honing stone 122a can be driven to rotate by a motor 122c. In the periphery honing device 122, the periphery of the wafer W is honed by pressing the surface in the groove 122b of the honing stone 122a against the periphery of the wafer W with a predetermined load. The two honing stones 122a can come near or separate from each other and are arranged to sandwich the wafer W therebetween. In this periphery honing device 122, the orientation flat O is also honed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The notch polishing device 130 comprises a disc-shaped buff 130a made of a foam resin or the like, as shown in FIG. 2. The buff 130a is supported by a pair of arms 130b and 130b. In the notch polishing device 130, the buff 130a can be rotated around the central axis thereof by a motor which is not shown. Polishing for the entirety of the notch portion N of the wafer W is carried out by pressing the periphery of the buff 130a against the notch portion N of the wafer W with a predetermined load while giving relative reciprocal rotation between the wafer and the buff within a small angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The periphery polishing device 131 comprises two cylindrical buff 131a, as shown in FIG. 7. On the peripheral surface of the buff 131a, a groove 131b which is the so-called form chamfering groove, for receiving the periphery of the wafer W is provided.

The unloader 132 has a construction in which the wafers W can be put into the cassette 104 one by one by the belt conveyor 132a and lifted up step by step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the polishing of the chamfered portion is completed, the wafer W which has reached to the cleaning part (G) is not positioned again.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the first embodiment of the processing method of the invention, because the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer is honed before polishing the chamfered peripheral portion, it is possible to extremely shorten the time required for processing the surface of the chamfered portion to have a roughness less than a predetermined value, to obtain the target smoothness, and also to set right the sectional shape of the chamfered portion which was got out of shape in a previous step. According to this method, the time required for obtaining a surface of the chamfered portion to have a roughness of about 50 nm in terms of P-V value was only about 20% of that of a method having no honing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 10 shows a second embodiment of the wafer processing method of the invention. In this embodiment, a chamfered portion grinding and polishing steps are adopted for compensating the deformation in a sectional shape of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, which was generated in the preceding step, that is, lapping, etching, or both surfaces polishing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 10, the wafer processing method according to the embodiment comprises a chamfering step, a lapping step, an etching step, a both surfaces polishing step, a chamfered portion grinding and polishing step, and a front surface polishing step, which are sequentially performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Chamfering step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The peripheral portion of a wafer which was obtained by slicing an ingot by using an inner diameter saw slicing machine or a wire saw slicing machine, is ground to round by using a grinding stone while supplying a grinding fluid, to form a chamfered portion, similarly to the first embodiment. The grain size of the grinding stone used for the chamfering step is not limited, however, and is preferably about #300 to #800. The term "peripheral portion" means the entirety of the periphery including the notch portion N in case of a wafer W with a notch portion N as shown in FIG. 3, and the entirety of the periphery including an orientation flat in case of a wafer W with an orientation flat as shown in FIG. 9, unless particularly described otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Lapping step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One or both of the front and rear surfaces of the wafer for which the chamfering step was completed, are lapped by using a slurry containing abrasive grain, e.g., silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) or the like, and an additive such as a fatty acid salt or the like, under a pressure, similarly to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Etching step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to remove a cracked layer (a cracked and roughened portion) or a contaminated portion, the etching for the surfaces of the wafer is carried out by immersing the wafer in a liquid of sodium hydroxide or of potassium hydroxide, similarly to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Both surfaces polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to improve the flatness of the wafer extremely and for improving the smoothness of the rear surface to prevent occurrence of Si chips, the wafer is set on a carrier and the front and rear surfaces of the wafer are simultaneously polished by buffs which are set on lapping plates arranged in upper and lower sides of the wafer, while supplying an abrasive liquid. When an alkali etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is preferably carried out. On the contrary, when an acid etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is not essential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) Chamfered portion grinding and polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The peripheral portion except the notch portion N in case of a wafer W with a notch portion N, of the wafer is ground to round again by using a grinding stone. This step is for compensating the plan and sectional shapes of the chamfered portion which were damaged in the preceding lapping and etching steps, to form a predetermined desirable shape again, and for improving the smoothness thereof which was damaged in these steps. The grain size of the grinding stone used for the chamfering step is not limited, however, and is preferably about #1000 to #3000. Thereafter, the peripheral portion of the wafer is polished by using a buff or the like. This step is for removing working damage in the wafer caused by the preceding grinding step, and for preventing generation of chips or fine particles of silicon in the middle of a following step for manufacturing a device by smoothness of the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) Front surface polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The front surface of the wafer is polished by a buff while supplying an abrasive liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a second embodiment of a chamfered portion processing equipment used for the above-described method will be explained. In this embodiment, the same numbers are attached to almost the same structural members, elements or the like as those of the first embodiment.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">According to the second embodiment of the processing method of the invention, it is possible to compensate the deformed plan and sectional shapes of the chamfered portion before sending to a step for manufacturing semiconductor devices. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the possibility of resist material to be removed remaining on the peripheral portion of the wafer in the step for manufacturing semiconductor devices. In particular, even in the case of the smoothness of the periphery of the wafer being degraded by an alkali etching, the grinding performed after the etching step can recover or remove the smoothness of the periphery to some extent. Thereby, it is possible to shorten the time required for the following polishing step for the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the second embodiment of the processing equipment of the invention, it is possible to effectively carry out grinding and polishing for the chamfered portion of the wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13 shows a third embodiment of the wafer processing method of the invention. In this embodiment, a chamfered portion grinding step and chamfered portion honing and polishing steps are adopted for compensating the deformation in a sectional shape of the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, which was generated in the preceding step, that is, lapping, etching, or both surfaces polishing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13 shows a third embodiment of the wafer processing method of the invention. As shown in this Figure, the wafer processing method according to the embodiment comprises a chamfering step, a lapping step, an etching step, a both surfaces polishing step, a chamfered portion grinding step, a chamfered portion honing and polishing step, and a front surface polishing step, which are sequentially performed. Each step is carried out as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The chamfering step, the lapping step, the etching step, and the both surfaces polishing step were carried out in almost the same manner as those of the second embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Chamfering step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, the peripheral portion of a wafer which is obtained by slicing an ingot by using an inner diameter saw slicing machine or a wire saw slicing machine, is ground to round by using a grinding stone while supplying a grinding fluid, to form a chamfered portion. The grain size of the grinding stone used for the chamfering step is about #300 to #800.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Lapping step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One or both of the front and rear surfaces of the wafer for which the chamfering step was completed, are lapped by using a slurry containing abrasive grain, e.g., silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) or the like, and an additive such as a fatty acid salt or the like, under a pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Etching step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The etching for the surfaces of the wafer is carried out by immersing the wafer in a liquid of sodium hydroxide or of potassium hydroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Both surfaces polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer is set on a carrier and the front and rear surfaces of the wafer are simultaneously polished by buffs which are set on lapping plates arranged in upper and lower sides of the wafer, while supplying an abrasive liquid. When an alkali etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is preferably carried out. On the contrary, when an acid etching was used in the preceding step, the both surfaces polishing step is not essential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) Chamfered portion grinding step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer is ground to round again by using a grinding stone while supplying a grinding fluid. This step is for compensating the plan and sectional shapes of the chamfered portion which were damaged in the preceding lapping and etching steps, and for recovering or improving the smoothness thereof which was damaged in these steps. The grain size of the grinding stone used for the chamfering step is not limited, however, and is preferably about #1000 to #3000. In this case, grinding for the chamfered portion of the notch portion N may not be necessarily carried out because the notch portion N is small and the deformation thereof is also small. Although grinding for the chamfered portion of the notch portion N may be carried out, of course, it takes much time to grind.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) Chamfered portion honing and polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Honing, that is, processing to grind the notch portion of the wafer by a honing stone while applying a predetermined load to the honing stone and supplying a grinding fluid, is carried out. This step is for improving the smoothness of the notch chamfered portion to some extent which was damaged in the etching step. Thereafter, similarly, honing is carried out to also the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer, by grinding the entirety of the portion of the wafer by a honing stone while applying a predetermined load to the honing stone and supplying a grinding fluid. This step is for improving the smoothness of the chamfered portion which has an appropriate shape compensated by the preceding chamfered portion grinding step. The grain size of the grinding stone used for each honing step is not limited, however, is preferably about #2000 to #5000. The bond for the honing stone in each honing step is not either particularly limited, however, and a vitrified bond of ceramic raw material system, a metal bond, a resin bond, a metal-resin mixture bond, or gum is preferably used. Accordingly, it is possible to improve not only the smoothness of the surfaces but the ability to set right the sectional shape of the chamfered portion which was got out of shape in previous lapping and etching steps. Thereafter, the chamfered peripheral portion of the wafer is polished by a buff or the like while supplying an abrasive liquid. This step is for removing residual strain in the surface layer caused by the preceding grinding step or honing step, and for preventing generation of chips or fine particles of silicon in the middle of following step for manufacturing a device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(7) Front surface polishing step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The front surface of the wafer is polished by a buff while supplying an abrasive liquid.</div>
