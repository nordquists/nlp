<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This application is a Divisional of our prior U.S. application Ser. No. 09/065,392, filed Apr. 23, 1998 now adondoned.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a method of making a group III-V compound semiconductor wafer, and more particularly, it relates to a method of making a group III-V compound semiconductor wafer having an epitaxial layer grown by vapor-phase epitaxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The recent development of optical communication has caused an increase in the production quantity of photodiodes and the like. For example, an InP photodiode (hereinafter referred to as a pin-PD) is prepared by growing an epitaxial layer on an indium-phosphorus (hereinafter referred to as (InP) substrate by chloride vapor-phase epitaxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to prepare a pin-PD, an InP substrate is formed by cutting an InP ingot into slices and chamfering and grinding and polishing each slice. Then, a group III-V compound layer is epitaxially grown on this substrate for preparing an InP wafer, and thereafter a Zn diffusion layer, a protective film and the like are formed on this InP wafer. While the InP wafer grown into a diameter of two inches is generally cut into a rectangular form and thereafter sub-jected to a device process of forming the Zn diffusion layer and the like, such a wafer has recently been subjected to the device process in the circular shape of 2 inches in diameter as such, in order to reduce the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An end portion of the InP wafer, which is generally picked up and carried with tweezers or held by a conveying machine, may be chipped or cracked in the device process. In order to prevent this, the end portion of the substrate is generally chamfered. For example, Japanese Utility Model Laying-Open No. 58-103144 (1983) describes a technique of forming a prescribed chamfered part on an end portion of a GaAs substrate for preventing flaws in mirror grinding or chipping in step movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-61201 (1994) discloses a technique of forming a prescribed chamfered part on an end portion of a silicon substrate for preventing occurrence of edge crowns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a wafer prepared by growing an epitaxial layer on an InP substrate provided with a chamfered portion is subjected to a device process, however, the wafer is disadvantageously cracked in a diffusion step for impurity introduction, a thermal CVD step for forming a protective film or an ultrasonic cleaning step for removing foreign matter.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, the present invention has been proposed for solving such a problem, and an object thereof is to provide a method of making a group III-V compound semiconductor wafer which is hardly cracked in a device process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A group III-V compound semiconductor wafer prepared ac-cording to an aspect of the present invention comprises a semiconductor substrate consisting of a group III-V compound and a group III-V compound layer formed on this semiconductor substrate. An epitaxial abnormal grown part is removed from the outer peripheral edge portion of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer. The epitaxial abnormal grown part is a part of the group III-V compound layer having a relatively large thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A portion of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer is removed up to a location separated from the original outer peripheral edge part by a distance L. The distance L is the length of the stock amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the surface roughness Rmax of the outer peripheral edge of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer formed by removing the abnormal grown part is preferably not more than 2/μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The group III-V compound layer is preferably formed to have a (100) plane as a plane substantially parallel to the major surface of the substrate. “Substantially parallel” means that the (100) plane forms an angle of not more than, 16 degrees with the major surface of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Before the epitaxial layer is formed, the semiconductor substrate consisting of a group III-V compound is chamfered in such a manner that an outer peripheral edge portion thereof has a sectional shape with an arcuate shape substantially having a radius R. The distance L satisfies an expression R≦L≦3R.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The semiconductor substrate is preferably exposed on a portion at a distance up to 0.1 mm from the outer peripheral edge of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The outer peripheral edge of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer is preferably so chamfered when removing the abnormal grown part, so that its section has an arcuate shape substantially with a radius r, which is preferably at least 0.1 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to prevent a wafer from cracking in the aforementioned device process, the inventors have first studied the cause for the cracking. Consequently, they have found that an epitaxial layer is grown at an abnormally high speed in a specific plane orientation part of the periphery of the wafer prepared by growing an InGaAs epitaxial layer on an InP substrate, to remarkably crack the wafer particularly in this part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 1, an InGaAs epitaxial layer <b>2</b> is formed on a surface of an InP substrate <b>1</b> as a group III-V compound layer. Arrows (100), (111) and (011) denote (100), (111) and (011) planes of the InP substrate <b>1</b> respectively. The outer peripheral edge portion of the InP substrate <b>1</b> has an arcuate shape with a radius R. A part 2X of the InGaAs epitaxial layer <b>2</b> has a large thickness due to abnormal high-speed growth. Another part 2Y of the InGaAs epitaxial layer <b>2</b> has a small thickness to the contrary. It has been recognized that, when a wafer having the epitaxial layer <b>2</b> which is partially varied in thickness is subjected to a device process, remarkable stress is caused in a heat cycle of the device process since the thermal expansion coefficients of the InP substrate <b>1</b> and the InGaAs epitaxial layer <b>2</b> are extremely different from each other, to result in cracking of the part 2X having a large thickness. Also as an inherent feature of the two different group III-V materials of the substrate <b>1</b> and of the layer <b>2</b>, there is a lattice mismatch between these two materials, especially at the abnormally grown part 2X, which contributes to the tendency of cracking of the part 2X in a heat cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, an end portion of the wafer causing abnormal growth in the vicinity of the (111) plane is removed up to a position shown by a dotted line <b>3</b> after the epitaxy,thereby eliminating the abnormal grown part. Thus, it is possible to obtain a group III-V compound semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> which is hardly cracked in the device process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The inventors have made various experiments, to find that the wafer <b>10</b> having an outer peripheral edge portion which is so chamfered that the section of the substrate <b>1</b> has an arcuate shape substantially with a radius R readily causes an abnormal grown part in a portion at a distance of 0 to R from the outer peripheral edge in particular. If at least the portion at the distance R from the edge of the wafer <b>10</b> is removed, therefore, the abnormal grown part is eliminated. On the other hand, the amount L of removal is preferably minimized since the InP substrate <b>1</b> can be more effectively utilized as the amount L of removal is reduced. In the current equipment, however, the positioning accuracy is substantially equal to the radius R (=0.25 mm) of substrates generally employed at present, and hence the amount L of removal is dispersed in the range of ±R. When the upper limit of the amount L of removal is set at 3R, therefore, the portion at the distance R from the edge of the wafer <b>10</b> can be removed in the worst case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is preferable that the InGaAs epitaxial layer <b>2</b> serving as the group III-V compound layer is formed to have the (100) plane as a plane substantially parallel to the major surface of the InP substrate <b>1</b>, so that the abnormal grown part 2X is located on the (111) plane to satisfy the aforementioned condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is further preferable that the surface roughness Rmax of the outer peripheral edge of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> obtained by removing the aforementioned portion is not more than 2 μm, so that no starting point is present to cause cracking of the wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 1, the epitaxial abnormal grown part 2X is removed from the outer peripheral edge portion of the group III-V compound semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> according to the present invention, whereby the wafer <b>10</b> is hardly cracked in the device process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has been recognized that the wafer <b>10</b> is hardly cracked in the device process if the InP substrate <b>1</b> is exposed on a portion at a distance up to 0.1 mm from the outer peripheral edge of the wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is preferable that the outer peripheral edge portion of the wafer <b>10</b> is so chamfered that its section has an arcuate shape substantially with a radius r, which is at least 0.1 mm. The radius r is set to be at least 0.1 mm since there is no chamfering grindstone having a chamfering radius of less than 0.1 mm at present. Even if a grindstone having a chamfering radius of less than 0.1 mm is developed, its working accuracy is so insufficient that the working surface is inferior in flatness since the grain size of diamond forming the grindstone is about 0.05 μm. Even if the outer peripheral edge portion of the wafer <b>10</b> is so chamfered that the radius r is less than 0.1 mm, further, an end portion of the wafer <b>10</b> is readily cracked during grinding of the wafer <b>10</b> or in the device process due to its sharpness.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Example of the present invention is now described with reference to the drawings. Referring to FIG. 2A, a vapor-phase epitaxy apparatus <b>11</b> comprises a reactor <b>12</b>, driving means <b>13</b>, heaters <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, source boards <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, and source containers <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>. The source boards <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> containing indium (In) and the source board <b>16</b> containing gallium (Ga) are provided in the reactor <b>12</b>. The driving means <b>13</b> is adapted to rotate a substrate <b>22</b> along the illustrated arrow. Hydrogen is fed into the source containers <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> containing AsCl<sub>3 </sub>and the source container <b>20</b> containing PCl<sub>3 </sub>through pipes <b>101</b> to <b>103</b> respectively. The source containers <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> are connected with the source boards <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> through pipes <b>104</b> to <b>106</b> respectively. The heaters <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>heat the reactor <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With such an apparatus <b>11</b>, outputs of the heaters <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>were first adjusted to form the temperature distribution shown in FIG. 2B in the reactor <b>12</b>. Then, the substrate <b>22</b> consisting of InP doped with sulfur was set on the driving means <b>13</b>. This substrate <b>22</b> was 51 mm in diameter and 450μm in thickness. Further, the radius R of this substrate <b>22</b> was 0.25 mm on its end or peripheral edge section, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. The driving means <b>13</b> rotated and moved the substrate <b>22</b> downward in FIG. <b>2</b>A.

<div class="description-paragraph">From the formula (7), an InGaAs photoreceiving layer <b>24</b> of 3μm in thickness was formed on the substrate <b>22</b> as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The driving means <b>13</b> moved the substrate <b>22</b> downward in FIG. <b>2</b>A and hydrogen gas was fed into the source container <b>20</b>, thereby forming an InP window layer <b>25</b> of about 1.5 μm in thickness on the substrate <b>22</b> as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. Thus, a wafer <b>21</b> provided with an epitaxial layer <b>26</b> as a group III-V compound layer was formed on the substrate <b>22</b> by chloride VPE as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the wafer <b>21</b> was taken out from the reactor <b>12</b>, for vacuum-sucking and holding a back surface <b>27</b> of the wafer <b>21</b> provided with no epitaxial layer <b>26</b>. A diamond grindstone of #800 (Japanese Industrial Standards) in grain size and 0.25 mm in arc radius shown in FIG. 5 was brought into contact with the wafer <b>21</b> along arrow <b>28</b> in FIG. 3, for removing a Dortion at a distance of 0.4 mm from the edge of the raw wafer <b>21</b>, i.e., the portion up to A in FIG. <b>3</b>. In order to reduce a load in finish working and completely eliminate an abnormal grown part, a portion at a distance of at least 0.1 mm and not more than 0.2 mm from the edge of the wafer <b>21</b> was chamfered for bringing the edge into a shape denoted by B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, a portion at a distance of 0.1 mm from the edge of the wafer <b>21</b> was removed with a diamond grindstone of #2000 (Japanese Industrial Standards) in grain size and 0.25 mm in arc radius, for bringing the edge of the wafer <b>21</b> into a shape denoted by C. Further, a portion at a distance of 0.2 to 0.25 mm from the edge of the wafer <b>21</b> was chamfered for bringing the edge of the wafer <b>21</b> into a shape denoted by D. Thus, the inventive wafer <b>21</b> was completed with surface roughness Rmax of not more than 2.0 μm on its end surface and a diameter of 50 mm. When the wafer <b>21</b> prepared in the aforementioned manner was subjected to a device process, the cracking ratio was reduced to about ⅕ as compared with the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 7, it is understood that a wafer <b>101</b> according to the present invention is formed by a substrate <b>104</b> and an epitaxial layer <b>103</b>, and an abnormal grown part can be removed from an outer peripheral portion <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>101</b>. It is also understood that no linear flaws are caused on the inventive wafer <b>101</b> shown in FIG. 7 having no distortion on the outer peripheral portion <b>102</b>. Referring to FIG. 8, on the other hand, it is understood that a wafer <b>201</b> having an unremoved abnormal grown Part is formed by a substrate <b>204</b> and an epitaxial layer <b>203</b>, and a number of linear flaws <b>205</b> are caused by distortion of its outer peripheral portion <b>202</b>. In this wafer <b>201</b>, further, the thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>203</b> is about three times in the abnormal grown part as compared with the flat part. Also from this, it is understood that distortion in the peripheral portion of the wafer <b>101</b> is effectively eliminated in the present invention due to the removal of the abnormal grown part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While an Example of the present invention has been des-cribied above, this Example can be modified in various ways. The diameter of the substrate <b>22</b> prepared first was set at 51 mm, in order to prevent such a problem that the apparatus may fail to grasp the wafer <b>21</b> in a device process step which is set for 50 mm if the diameter of the substrate <b>22</b> is smaller than 50 mm. If the wafer <b>21</b> is carried by handling, therefore, its diameter may not be 51 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the chloride VPE employed for epitaxy is advantageous for a product such as a pin-PD requiring a relatively thick epitaxial layer in the point that this method can grow the epitaxial layer at a high speed, the epitaxial layer may alternatively be prepared by organic metal vapor-phase epitaxy if a thick epitaxial layer is not required. Further, the present invention is applicable to all epitaxy methods having plane orientation dependency of the epitaxial layer growing rate such as a hydride method and an organic metal method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to chamfer the wafer, it is preferable to use an integrated grindstone having two types of grain sizes for improving the working accuracy. While the grindstone comes into contact with the epitaxial layer for removing the end portion of the wafer, the epitaxial layer is preferably cleaned after coming into contact with the grindstone. Alternatively, the remaining portion of the epitaxial layer may be protected with a resist film or a tape, which is removed after the end portion has been removed by grinding. Further, the substrate may be prepared not only from InP but also from another group III-V compound having the same crystal structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</div>
