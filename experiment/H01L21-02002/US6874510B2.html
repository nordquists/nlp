<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00002">The present invention relates to a method of performing the edge clean operation on semiconductor wafers. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of using a laser to perform the edge clean operation on semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00003">One of the major problems gaining attention in wafer processing today is the edge related defects. Edge related defects contribute to lower die yield and lost revenue. A typical type of edge defect is the peeling of edge films due to poor adhesion to underlying layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00004">Many processing schemes have been devised and implemented to reduce edge related defects. The majority of processing schemes involve costly photo masking and etching steps in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the defects. The wafer is coated with photo resist and run through an edge bead removal step. The wafer is then etched in a plasma etcher to remove the films on the edge of the wafer. The resist is then stripped off in both a dry and then wet process. The wafer is then sent on for subsequent processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00005">The disadvantage associated with these existing solutions is that the wafers have to run through additional processing steps that can add both high cost and long cycle times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00006">Therefore, an improved method for performing the edge clean operation on a semiconductor wafer is needed. The present invention provides such a method for performing the edge clean operation on a semiconductor wafer. Features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon a reading of the attached specification, in combination with a study of the drawings.</div>
<heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00007">A primary object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide a method of using a laser to perform the edge clean operation on a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00008">An object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide a significant reduction in process steps necessary to accomplish the edge cleaning process on a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00009">An object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide for the elimination of the need for a very expensive resist coating track, photolithe stepper, plasma etcher, resist asher and solvent resist strip such that a significant reduction in capital equipment costs and a decrease in wafer cycle time are achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00010">Another object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide the capability to control the laser power and incidence angle to enable selective cleaning down to any desired layer by adjusting laser power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00011">Another object of an embodiment of the invention is to provide semiconductor wafers having their edges cleaned by the method of using a laser with a clean boundary between the clean and non-cleaned areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00012">Briefly, and in accordance with at least one of the foregoing, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for performing the edge clean operation on a semiconductor wafer. Specifically, a laser beam is used to accurately clean the edge of the wafer. The wafer is clamped concentrically to a chuck and rotated at a selectable speed, such as in the range of 10 rpm to 1,000 rpm. A laser beam of variable power is directed onto the edge of the wafer at an oblique angle through a nozzle through which an inert purge gas is simultaneously passed. The laser beam removes unwanted deposits at the edge of the wafer and the gas is used to blow away the residue and prevent slag buildup on other parts of the wafer. The process is carried out in an exhausted chamber. Preferably, there is accurate wafer concentricity and laser alignment to the wafer edge. Preferably, an accurate form of wafer to chuck alignment system is used. This can be insured by use of a co-axial closed-loop video monitoring system that monitors both the edge of the wafer and the point of contact by the laser.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00016">While this invention may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will be described herein in detail, a specific embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that as illustrated and described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00017">The present invention provides a method <b>100</b> of performing an edge clean operation on a semiconductor wafer <b>20</b>, which is illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. The system <b>15</b> used for performing the method <b>100</b> is illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00018">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the system <b>15</b> used for performing the method <b>100</b> includes the wafer <b>20</b> having an edge <b>25</b>. Film <b>30</b> is attached to a top surface <b>35</b> of the wafer <b>20</b>. The system <b>15</b> further includes a chuck <b>40</b>, a laser <b>45</b> having a nozzle <b>50</b>, and a video monitoring system <b>55</b>. The laser <b>45</b> is capable of emitting a laser beam <b>60</b> through the nozzle <b>50</b>. An inert purge gas <b>65</b> is also emitted through the nozzle <b>50</b> of the laser <b>45</b>. The video monitoring system <b>55</b> is preferably a co-axial closed-loop video monitoring system. The laser <b>45</b> is configured to emit laser beams <b>60</b> of variable power. The system is provided within an exhausted chamber <b>70</b>, although the video monitoring system <b>55</b> does not necessarily have to be provided within the exhausted chamber <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00019">The method <b>100</b> of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to FIG. <b>1</b>. The first step <b>110</b> of the method <b>100</b> is to clamp the wafer <b>20</b> to the chuck <b>40</b> such that the top surface <b>35</b>, and thus the film <b>30</b> on the top surface <b>35</b> of the wafer <b>20</b>, are not positioned on the chuck <b>40</b>. The wafer <b>20</b> is preferably clamped concentrically to the chuck <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00020">The second step <b>120</b> of the method <b>100</b> is to rotate the chuck <b>40</b>, with the wafer <b>20</b> clamped thereto, at a selectable speed. The selectable speed of the rotation of the chuck <b>40</b>, with the wafer <b>20</b> clamped thereto, is preferably between ten revolutions per minute (10 rpm) and one-thousand revolutions per minute (1,000 rpm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00021">The third step <b>130</b> of the method <b>100</b> is to direct the laser beam <b>60</b> at an oblique angle through the nozzle <b>50</b> of the laser <b>45</b> to the edge <b>25</b> of the wafer <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00022">The fourth step <b>140</b> of the method <b>100</b> is to remove unwanted deposits, such as the film <b>30</b> on the top surface <b>35</b> of the wafer <b>20</b>, at the edge <b>25</b> of the wafer <b>20</b> with the laser beam <b>60</b> Thus, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the top surface <b>35</b> of the wafer <b>20</b> proximate to the edge <b>25</b> thereof is clean of unwanted deposits, such as the film <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00023">The fifth step <b>150</b> of the method <b>100</b> is to blow away the removed unwanted deposits <b>30</b> from the wafer <b>20</b> with an inert purge gas <b>65</b> which is passed through the nozzle <b>50</b> of the laser <b>45</b>. The inert purge gas <b>65</b> is preferably passed through the nozzle <b>50</b> of the laser <b>45</b> at the same time the laser beam <b>60</b> is removing unwanted deposits <b>30</b> from the top surface <b>35</b> of the wafer <b>20</b> in the fourth step <b>140</b>. Because the inert purge gas <b>65</b> blows away the removed unwanted deposits <b>30</b> from the wafer <b>20</b>, slag build up on other parts of the wafer <b>20</b> is prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00024">The method <b>100</b> is preferably performed in the exhausted chamber <b>70</b>. Preferably, there is accurate concentricity of the wafer <b>20</b> and alignment of the laser <b>45</b> with the edge <b>25</b> of the wafer <b>20</b>. Preferably, an accurate form of wafer <b>20</b> to chuck <b>40</b> alignment system is used. This can be insured by the use of the co-axial closed loop video monitoring system <b>55</b> that monitors both the edge <b>25</b> of the wafer <b>20</b> and the point of contact by the laser beam <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00025">It should be understood that the sequence of steps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> described in the method <b>100</b> is only the preferred sequence of operation of the steps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, such that certain steps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> could be performed prior to other steps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> or could be done simultaneously with other steps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>. For instance, the third step <b>130</b> could be performed prior to, or simultaneously with the second step <b>120</b>. Likewise, the fourth and fifth steps <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> could be performed simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00026">The system <b>15</b> and method <b>100</b> provide a number of advantages in cleaning the edge <b>25</b> of a wafer <b>20</b> in comparison to those of the prior art. The system <b>15</b> and method <b>100</b> provide a significant reduction in process steps necessary to accomplish the edge cleaning process. The system <b>15</b> and the method <b>100</b> eliminate the need for a very expensive resist coating track, photolithe stepper, resist asher, and solvent resist strip, such that a significant reduction in capital equipment costs and a decrease in wafer cycle time are achieved. An additional advantage of the system <b>15</b> and the method <b>100</b> is the capability to control the power of the laser <b>45</b> and the incidence angle to enable selective cleaning down to an desired layer by adjusting the power of the laser <b>45</b>. Further, the edge clean accomplished by this method leaves a clean boundary between clean and non-cleaned area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00027">While a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</div>
