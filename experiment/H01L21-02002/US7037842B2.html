<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor processing and more specifically to a method and apparatus for dissolving a gas into a liquid used for cleaning, etching, or rinsing a wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Discussion of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Wet etching and wet cleaning of silicon wafers is usually done by immersing the wafers into a liquid. This can also be done by spraying a liquid onto a wafer or batch of wafers. Wet wafer cleaning and etching is traditionally done in a batch mode where several (e.g., between 50–100) wafers are processed simultaneously. Because of the need a short cycle time in chip manufacturing, there is a need for fast single wafer processing. In wet processing the amount of dissolved gas in the liquid used for processing is very important for process results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">When performing wet etching operations, the amount of gas is very important for process results. At first there are the common reactive gases such as O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>. On the other side there are the inert gases such as N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and He. Both the reactive gas content and inert gas content are important in wet processing. The reactive gas can react with the semiconductor wafer surface or with contaminants on the surface. The inert gases determine the amount of cavitation during a megasonic cleaning step and therefore influence the particle removal. It is very important to control the amount of both reactive gases and inert gases dissolved into liquids when using wet processing to treat semiconductor wafers. Sometimes it is assumed that all dissolved reactive gases are “bad” and therefore it is assumed that the concentration of O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2 </sub>has to be reduced to the minimum level possible. However, the right amount or the absence of reactive gases is dependent on a particular process and there is not a general level of dissolved reactive gases that is adequate for every process step. Present methods for dissolving gases into liquids include membrane contactors, bubbling chambers, spraying methods and shower type methods. A problem with these methods and apparatuses, however, is that they are bulky and expensive. They are ideal for batch processing tools but are to large and to expensive for very small single wafer tools.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Thus, there is a need for a simple and inexpensive way for dissolving the correct amount of reactive and inert gases into etching, cleaning, and rinsing liquids.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The present invention is a method and apparatus for dissolving gases into a liquid in a wet processing apparatus. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that these specific details are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Additionally, in other instances, well-know processing techniques and equipment have not been set forth in particular detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The present invention is a method and apparatus for dissolving reactive and/or inert gases into a liquid and then using the liquid for wet processing. The present invention utilizes a venturi to dissolve a gas or gases such as but not limited to O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and He into a processing liquid supply line of a wet processing apparatus. The use of a ventui is ideally situated for dissolving gases into a liquid in a single wafer wet processing apparatus <b>100</b> such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">According to the present invention a venturi <b>128</b> is placed in a liquid supply conduit <b>126</b> before a opening such as spray or dispensing unit <b>114</b> located over a wafer support <b>110</b> which holds a wafer <b>108</b> to be processed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a</i>. In an embodiment of the present invention the venturi <b>128</b> is situated at or near the point of use (e.g., near spray nozzle <b>114</b>). A venturi <b>128</b> is a throat or narrowing of the cross-sectional area of supply line <b>126</b>. The venturi <b>128</b> creates under pressure locally because of the increase in flow rate of the liquid flowing through venturi <b>128</b> according to the Bernouilli principle. The use of a Bernouilli enables gases <b>129</b> to be dissolved into the flow of a processing liquid even when the supply gas is at a lower pressure than the processing liquid supply pressure. This provides added flexibility as to the supply of gas <b>129</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">A gas <b>129</b> is dissolved into processing liquid through an opening <b>127</b> provided in conduit <b>126</b> of venturi <b>128</b>. Because of the reduced pressure of venturi <b>128</b> gas can be easily dissolved into a liquid streaming past venturi <b>128</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The dissolved gas can be an inert gas such as but not limited to N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He, or a reactive gas such as O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>. The gases can be dissolved in a wide variety of liquids used for wet processing such as but not limited to etching solutions such as HF and buffered HF, cleaning solutions such as SC-1 (NH<sub>4</sub>OH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O) and SC-2 (HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O), and rinsing solutions such DI water. For example, O<sub>3 </sub>can be dissolved into DI water to help rinse away chelating agents and surfactants used in cleaning solutions. Venturi <b>128</b> is ideal for dissolving O<sub>3 </sub>into DI water because O<sub>3 </sub>is typically supplied at lower pressures than the DI water is supplied into conduit <b>126</b>. Additionally, inert gases such as He or N<sub>2 </sub>can be dissolved into processing fluids in order to provide cavitation into a liquid film <b>122</b> formed on wafer <b>108</b> in order to improve the cleaning, etching, or rinsing of a wafer. The venturi <b>128</b> of the present invention is ideal for use in a single wafer processing apparatus such as apparatus <b>100</b> because it is a simple, quick, small, and cheap inline system for dissolving gas into a liquid. Additionally, venturi <b>128</b> can precisely control the amount of gas which is dissolved into a liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Because ventui <b>128</b> can be used to precisely control the amount of gas dissolved into a fluid it enables a processing fluid to be generated which has the appropriate gas and with the appropriate concentration at the point of use for each process step. That is, according to an embodiment of the present invention first all gas is removed to the absolute minimum from the processing fluid such as DI water. The removal of the gas can be accomplished at for example, the central facilities where tanks <b>124</b> can be located. Once all gases have been sufficiently removed, a venturi <b>128</b> can be used to dissolve, at the point of use, the desired concentration of reactive and/or inert gases into the process liquid for every process step. This will dramatically improve the uniformity of the wet process. Once the desired amount of gas is dissolved in the desired processing liquid, the liquid can be sprayed or dispensed onto wafer <b>108</b> for etching, cleaning, or rinsing the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Although venturi <b>128</b> can be used in any wet processing apparatus requiring a dissolved gas, venturi <b>128</b> is ideal for use in a single wafer processing apparatus, such as apparatus <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a</i>. Single wafer cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>a </i>includes a plate <b>102</b> with a plurality of acoustic or sonic transducers <b>104</b> located thereon. Plate <b>102</b> is preferably made of aluminum but can be formed of other materials such as but not limited to stainless steel and sapphire. The plate is preferably coated with a corrosion resistant fluoropolymer such as Halar. The transducers <b>104</b> are attached to the bottom surface of plate <b>102</b> by an epoxy <b>106</b>. The transducers <b>104</b> cover the entire bottom surface of plate <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>b</i>. The transducers <b>100</b> preferably generate sonic waves in the frequency range between 400 kHz and 8 MHz. In an embodiment of the present invention the transducers are piezoelectric devices. The transducers <b>104</b> create acoustic or sonic waves in direction perpendicular to the surface of water <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">A substrate or wafer <b>108</b> is held at distance of about 3 mm above the top surface of plate <b>102</b>. The wafer <b>108</b> is clamped by a plurality of clamps <b>110</b> face up to a wafer support <b>112</b> which can rotate wafer <b>108</b> about at central axis. The wafer support can rotate or spin the wafer <b>108</b> about a central axis at a rate between 0–6000 rpm. In apparatus <b>100</b> only wafer support <b>112</b> and wafer <b>108</b> are rotated during use whereas plate <b>102</b> remains in a fixed position. Additionally, in apparatus <b>100</b> wafer <b>108</b> is place face up wherein the side of the wafer with patterns or features such as transistors faces towards a nozzle <b>114</b> for spraying cleaning chemicals thereon and the backside of the wafer faces plate <b>102</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>c </i>the transducer covered plate <b>102</b> has a substantially same shape as wafer <b>108</b> and covers the entire surface area of wafer <b>108</b>. Apparatus <b>100</b> can include a sealable chamber <b>101</b> in which nozzle <b>114</b>, wafer <b>108</b>, and plate <b>102</b> are located.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">During use, DI water (DI-H<sub>2</sub>O) is fed through a feed through channel <b>116</b> and plate <b>102</b> and fills the gap between the backside of wafer <b>108</b> and plate <b>102</b> to provide a water filled gap <b>118</b> through which acoustic waves generated by transducers <b>104</b> can travel to substrate <b>108</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention DI water fed between wafer <b>108</b> and plate <b>102</b> is degassed so that cavitation is reduced in the DI water filled gap <b>118</b> where the acoustic waves are strongest thereby reducing potential damage to wafer <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Additionally during use, cleaning chemicals and rinsing water such as DI-H<sub>2</sub>O are fed through a nozzle <b>114</b> to generate a spray <b>120</b> of dropless with form a thin liquid coating <b>122</b> (as little as 100 microns) on the top surface of wafer <b>108</b> while wafer <b>108</b> is spun. In the present invention tanks <b>124</b> containing etching, cleaning, and rinsing solutions such as diluted HF, de-ionized water (DI-H<sub>2</sub>O), are coupled to conduit <b>126</b> which feeds nozzle <b>114</b>.</div>
