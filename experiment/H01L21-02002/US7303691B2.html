<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a polishing method for a semiconductor wafer for polishing the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">As a method for polishing a semiconductor wafer using a polishing slurry, there has been conventionally employed a method including a primary polishing step, a secondary polishing step and a finish polishing step. In such polishing method, the polishing slurry is reused in the primary polishing step and the secondary polishing step in terms of production cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As an arrangement applicable to such rough polishing steps prior to the finish polishing, there has been known a polishing system for polishing the semiconductor wafer using a recycled polishing slurry (see, for instance, Document: JP-A-2000-237959, left column of page 4 to right column of page 5).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In a system disclosed in the Document, new slurry is fed from an unused slurry feeding unit to a buffer tank, while a recycled slurry after filtering is fed from a recycle unit to the buffer tank. Then, the polishing slurries stored in the buffer tank are fed to each of polishing sections by pumps connected to each of the polishing sections, the pumps being separately controllable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">On the other hand, in the finish polishing, the polishing slurry recycled using the system disclosed in the Document is not typically used. Instead, a finishing-slurry prepared solution is used, the finishing-slurry prepared solution being prepared by adding alkaline solution and water-soluble polymer agent to silica particle to obtain a finishing-slurry stock solution and further adding purified water to the finishing-slurry stock solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">However, when the system disclosed in the Document is applied to the rough polishing step, contaminants that are contained in the recycled polishing slurry and cannot be removed by filtering might cause a lot of minute projecting defects to be generated on the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In addition, when the finishing-slurry prepared solution as described above is used in the finish polishing step, contaminants contained in the finishing-slurry prepared solution might cause a lot of projecting defects to be generated on the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a polishing method for a semiconductor wafer which provides proper polishing of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In a keen study, the inventor of the present invention found out that a stock solution of a polishing slurry (hereinafter, referred to as a polishing-slurry stock solution) contains primary particles of silica having a particle size distribution as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> in which the largest particle size is 0.1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Also, the inventor found out that a polishing slurry to be reused (hereinafter, referred to as a recycled slurry) contains: aggregates of silica particle in which the primary particles of the silica are aggregated due to a high pressure applied during polishing (hereinafter, referred to as an aggregated silica particle); and crystal substances of the silica particle that are formed when the polishing slurry is dried (hereinafter, referred to as a dried silica particle), the silica particles having a particle size distribution as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. It was verified that the aggregated silica particle and the dried silica particle are different from each other in composition ratio of Si/O and modulus of elasticity. To be specific, the aggregated silica particle has the composition ratio of Si/O of 40–50 wt %/50–60 wt % and the modulus of elasticity of lower than 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa. The dried silica particle has the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt % and the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In addition, it was verified that the aggregated silica particle had lower hardness and had weaker correlation with the number of projecting defect having heights of 10 nm or less resulted from the polishing (hereinafter, referred to as a minute defect) as compared to the dried silica particle, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">When the recycled slurry to be used in the rough polishing step just before the finish polishing step is filtered, there might be the following problems. When the size of solid matters that can be captured by filtering is small, a lot of aggregated silica particles and dried silica particles are removed, which lowers polishing rate. On the other hand, when the size of solid matters that can be captured by filtering is large, large dried silica particles cannot be removed, which increases the minute defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">A finish-slurry stock solution that is obtained by adding alkaline solution and water-soluble polymer agent to the silica particles was verified to contain silica particles having particle sizes of approx. 0.05 to 100 μm as shown in a graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. It was verified that the reason for such wide range of particle sizes was that the silica particles were aggregated due to the water-soluble polymer agent contained in the finishing-slurry stock solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In addition, the finishing-slurry stock solution was verified to contain crystal substances if the silica which are formed when the finishing-slurry stock solution was dried (hereinafter, referred to as a dried silica particle). The dried silica particle has the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt % and the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Thus, an effective way for reducing the minute defects caused by the dried silica particle is to remove the dried silica particles from the finishing-slurry stock solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">However, when the finishing-slurry stock solution is filtered by a filter to remove the dried silica particles, the filter is easily clogged with silica particles with large particle sizes produced by aggregation due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent, so that silica particles other than the dried silica particles are also removed. Accordingly, a specific gravity of the finishing-slurry stock solution is lowered, thereby significantly degrading polishing performances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">It was verified that when, for instance, an ultrasonic wave was applied to the finishing-slurry stock solution having a particle size distribution as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> in order to disperse the silica particle aggregated due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent, the finishing-slurry stock solution turned to contain silica particles having particle sizes of approx. 0.05 to 0.2 μm as shown in a graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The present invention has been devised on the basis of knowledge as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">According to an aspect of the present invention, a polishing method for a semiconductor wafer includes: a slurry adjusting step for adjusting a polishing slurry containing silica particles so that the number of silica particles having a composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, a modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and a particle size of 1 μm or larger is 3000 pcs/ml or less. The semiconductor wafer is polished using the polishing slurry adjusted in the slurry adjusting step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">According to the aspect of the present invention, in the slurry adjusting step, the polishing slurry containing the silica particle is so adjusted that the number of silica particles having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger is 3000 pcs/ml or less, namely the polishing slurry is so arranged that the number of dried silica particles having the particle size of 1 μm or larger is 3000 pcs/ml or less. The semiconductor wafer is polished using the polishing slurry adjusted in the slurry-adjusting step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">With the arrangement, the content of the dried silica particles in the polishing slurry to be used in the rough polishing step just before the finish polishing step, i.e., a content of components harder than the aggregated silica particles, is adjusted. Accordingly, as compared to an arrangement in which contents of the aggregated silica particles and the dried silica particles are adjusted, polishing rate can be enhanced, while reducing the number of minute defects generated in the rough polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The lower limit of the particle size of which the content is adjusted is set to 1 μm, which is the maximum value of a machining allowance in a typical finish polishing step. Accordingly, as compared to an arrangement in which the lower limit is set to be higher than 1 μm, heights of the minute defects generated in the rough polishing step can be easily adjusted to 1 μm or less, thereby realizing effective finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In addition, since the upper limit of the content to be adjusted is set to 3000 pcs/ml, the number of minute defects generated in the rough polishing step can be controlled to a predetermined number or less as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Therefore, the semiconductor wafer can be polished properly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that polishing of the semiconductor wafer includes two steps of a rough polishing step and a finish polishing step. The polishing slurry adjusted in the slurry adjusting step was used in the rough polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the slurry adjusting step includes: a stock-solution filtering step for filtering a stock solution of the polishing slurry with a first filter adapted to capture a solid matter having a predetermined size; a slurry producing step for producing the polishing slurry by compounding the stock solution of the polishing slurry filtered in the stock-solution filtering step and an additive; and a prepared-solution filtering step for filtering the polishing slurry produced in the slurry producing step with a second filter adapted to capture a solid matter having a size smaller than that captured by the first filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">According to the aspect of the present invention, the slurry adjusting step includes: the stock-solution filtering step for filtering a stock solution of the polishing slurry (hereinafter, referred to as a polishing-slurry stock solution) with the first filter adapted to capture the solid matters of a predetermined size; the slurry producing step for adding the additive to the polishing-slurry stock solution filtered in the stock-solution filtering step to produce the polishing slurry; and the prepared-solution filtering step for filtering the polishing slurry with the second filter adapted to capture the solid matters of the size smaller than those captured by the first filter. Accordingly, by simply providing the first filter and the second filter in the slurry adjusting step, the polishing slurry can be adjusted as described above so that the polishing slurry can polish the semiconductor wafer properly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Even when the dried silica particles are generated while the rough-polishing-slurry stock solution is stored, the dried silica particles having a predetermined size or larger are removed in the stock-solution filtering step, the number of dried silica particles contained in the polishing slurry produced in the slurry producing step can be reduced. In addition, the size of irremovable dried silica particles can be minimized. Thus, as compared to an arrangement without the stock-solution filtering step, the number of dried silica particles to be captured in the prepared-solution filtering step can be reduced, so that clogging of the second filter in the prepared-solution filtering step can be reduced, thereby effectively adjusting the polishing slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that a capturing efficiency of the first filter for capturing a solid matter having a size equal to or more than fifty times as large as a primary particle of silica contained in the stock solution of the polishing slurry is 99.99% or higher, and a capturing efficiency of the second filter for capturing a solid matter having a size equal to or more than ten times as large as the primary particle is 99.99% or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">According to the aspect of the present invention, the first filter has the capturing efficiency of 99.99% for capturing the solid matters having the size equal to or more than fifty times as large as the primary particles of the silica, and the second filter has the capturing efficiency of 99.99% for capturing the solid matters having the size equal to or more than ten times as large as the primary particles of the silica particles, thereby adjusting the polishing slurry more effectively as compared to an arrangement having other capturing performances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the slurry adjusting step further includes a centrifugalizing step for centrifugalizing the polishing slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the slurry adjusting step includes the centrifugalizing step for centrifugalizing the polishing slurry, by centrifugalizing the aggregated silica particles and the dried silica particles utilizing difference in density, the polishing slurry can be adjusted so that the polishing slurry can properly polish the semiconductor wafer as described above. In addition, since the used polishing slurry can be reused in the rough polishing step just before the finish polishing step, usage amount of the polishing-slurry stock solution can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that a centrifugal force for the centrifugalizing in the centrifugalizing step is in the range from 5000 G to 10000 G.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the lower limit of the centrifugal force in the centrifugalizing step is set to 5000 G, the dried silica particles can be centrifugalized and removed, thus reducing the number of minute defects. On the other hand, since the upper limit of the centrifugal force is set to 10000 G, the number of aggregated silica particles to be centrifugalized and removed can be minimized, thereby realizing polishing without lowering the polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the slurry adjusting step further includes a milling step for milling the silica particles contained in the polishing slurry with a bead mill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the slurry adjusting step includes the milling step for milling the silica particles contained in the polishing slurry with the bead mill, the dried silica particles contained in the polishing slurry can be milled, so that the polishing slurry can be adjusted so as to properly polish the semiconductor wafer as described above. Since the bead mill, of which an energy per unit mass applied to an object to be milled (hereinafter, referred to as a milling energy) is the smallest, is employed, hardness of the aggregated silica particles generated by the milling energy becomes lower as compared to an arrangement employing milling devices other than the bead mill, thereby realizing proper polishing. In addition, since the used polishing slurry can be reused in the rough polishing step just before the finish polishing step, usage amount of the polishing-slurry stock solution can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that an energy per unit mass applied to an object to be milled in the milling step is 20 kWh/dry kg or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the lower limit of a to-be-milled energy is set to 20 kWh/dry kg, the content of the dried silica particles in the polishing slurry can be effectively adjusted to 3000 pcs/ml or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that polishing of the semiconductor wafer includes two steps of a rough polishing step and a finish polishing step. The slurry adjusting step further includes a ultrasonic irradiating stage for irradiating an ultrasonic wave to the polishing slurry and a filtering stage for filtering with a filter the polishing slurry to which the ultrasonic wave is irradiated in the ultrasonic irradiating stage, the polishing slurry being adjusted so that the number of silica particles having a composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, a modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>or higher and a particle size of 1 μm or larger is 1000 pcs/ml or less. The polishing slurry adjusted in the slurry adjusting step is used in the finish polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">According to the aspect of the present invention, by irradiating the ultrasonic wave to the polishing slurry and filtering the ultrasonic-irradiated polishing slurry with the filter in the slurry adjusting step, the polishing slurry can be adjusted so that the number of silica particles having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger is 1000 pcs/ml or less. Then, the polishing slurry is used in the finish polishing step to polish the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">By irradiating the ultrasonic wave to the polishing slurry, the silica particles having large particle sizes, which are generated by aggregation due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent contained in the polymer slurry, can be dispersed. Then, by filtering with the filter the polishing slurry with the silica particles having been dispersed, clogging of the filter can be prevented, and the dried silica particle can be selectively removed. Therefore, reduction in specific gravity of the polishing slurry can be prevented, thereby preventing significant degradation of the polishing performances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In the finish polishing step, the polishing slurry is adjusted by the ultrasonic irradiation and filtering so that the number of silica particles having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger, i.e., the dried silica particle having the particle size of 1 μm or larger, is 1000 pcs/ml or less. Accordingly, the number of minute defects generated when the adjusted polishing slurry is used in the finish polishing step can be controlled to a predetermined number or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Therefore, the semiconductor wafer can be polished properly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the ultrasonic irradiating stage, the ultrasonic wave was irradiated to the polishing slurry with a temperature of the polishing slurry maintained to be 40° C. or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the ultrasonic wave is irradiated to the polishing slurry with the temperature maintained at 40° C. or lower in the ultrasonic irradiating stage, the silica particles having large particle sizes that are generated due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent can be dispersed under the condition where evaporation due to heat of the alkaline solution contained in the polishing slurry is prevented securely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">According to the aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the filtering stage, the polishing slurry is filtered within three hours after the ultrasonic wave is irradiated to the polishing slurry in the ultrasonic irradiating stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">According to the aspect of the present invention, since the polishing slurry is filtered within three hours after the ultrasonic wave is irradiated in the filtering stage, the dispersed silica particles can be filtered before re-aggregation due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer occurs, thereby preventing clogging of the filter more securely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">According to another aspect of the present invention, a polishing method for a semiconductor wafer for polishing the semiconductor wafer through two steps including a rough polishing step and a finish polishing step using a polishing slurry containing silica particles includes: a first slurry adjusting step for adjusting the polishing slurry so that the number of silica particles having a composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, a modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and a particle size of 1 μm or larger is 3000 pcs/ml or less; and a second slurry-adjusting step including a ultrasonic irradiating stage for irradiating an ultrasonic wave to the polishing slurry and a filtering stage for filtering with a filter the polishing slurry to which the ultrasonic wave is irradiated in the ultrasonic irradiating stage, the polishing slurry being adjusted so that the number of silica particles having a composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt % a modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and a particle size of 1 μm or larger is 1000 pcs/ml or less. In the finish polishing step, the semiconductor wafer is polished using the polishing slurry adjusted in the second slurry adjusting step.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">[Advantages and Effects of Semiconductor Wafer Polishing Device]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">According to the first embodiment described above, the following advantages and effects can be attained.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0118">(1) In the slurry adjusting step, the slurry adjusting section <b>150</b> of the polishing device <b>100</b> irradiates the ultrasonic wave to the finishing-slurry stock solution and filters the ultrasonic-irradiated finishing-slurry stock solution with the finishing filter <b>154</b>, thereby producing the polishing-slurry finish solution that has been adjusted so that the number of dried silica particles having the particle size of 1 μm or larger, i.e., the silica particle having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger, is 1000 pcs/ml or less. Then, in the finish polishing step, the finish polishing section <b>133</b> performs the finish polishing of the semiconductor wafer W using the polishing-slurry finish solution fed from the slurry adjusting section <b>150</b>.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">By irradiating the ultrasonic wave to the finishing-slurry stock solution, the silica particles with large particle sizes, which are generated by aggregation due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent contained in the finishing-slurry stock solution, can be dispersed. Then, by filtering with the finishing filter <b>154</b> the finishing-slurry stock solution with the silica particles dispersed, clogging of the finishing filter <b>154</b> can be prevented, so that the dried silica particles can be selectively removed. Therefore, reduction in specific gravity of the polishing-slurry finish solution can be prevented, thereby preventing significant degradation of the polishing performances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">In the finish polishing step, the finishing-slurry stock solution is adjusted by the ultrasonic irradiation and filtering so that the number of silica particles having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger, i.e., the dried silica particles having the particle sizes of 1 μm or larger, is 1000 pcs/ml or less. Accordingly, the number of minute defects generated when the adjusted finishing-slurry stock solution is used in the finish polishing step can be controlled to a predetermined number or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Therefore, the semiconductor wafer can be polished properly.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0122">(2) In the ultrasonic irradiating stage of the ultrasonic irradiating section <b>152</b>, the ultrasonic is irradiated to the finishing-slurry stock solution with its temperature maintained at 40° C. or lower.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">Thus, the silica particles having large particle sizes generated due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent can be dispersed while the evaporation due to heat of the alkaline solution contained in the finishing-slurry stock solution can be securely prevented.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0124">(3) In the filtering stage performed by the finishing filtrate feeder <b>153</b> and the finishing filter <b>154</b>, the finishing-slurry stock solution just after the ultrasonic-irradiation in the ultrasonic irradiating stage is filtered.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Therefore, the silica particles dispersed by the ultrasonic wave can be filtered before the silica particles are re-aggregated due to the effect of the water-soluble polymer agent, thereby preventing clogging of the finishing filter <b>154</b> more securely.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">[Advantages and Effects of Semiconductor Wafer Polishing Device]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">According to the second embodiment described above, the following advantages and effects can be attained.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0187">(4) In the slurry adjusting step, the slurry adjusting section <b>250</b> of the polishing device <b>200</b> feeds to the secondary polishing section <b>132</b> the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution that has been adjusted so that the number of dried silica particles having the particle size of 1 μm or larger, i.e., the silica particles having the composition ratio of Si/O of 50–60 wt %/40–50 wt %, the modulus of elasticity of 1.4×10<sup>10 </sup>Pa or higher and the particle size of 1 μm or larger, is 1000 pcs/ml or less. Then, in the secondary polishing step, the secondary polishing section <b>132</b> performs the secondary polishing of the semiconductor wafer W using the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution fed from the slurry adjusting section <b>250</b>.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">Thus, since a content of the dried silica particles in the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution used in the secondary polishing step just before the finish polishing step is adjusted, the polishing rate can be enhanced and the number of minute defects generated in the secondary polishing step can be reduced as compared to an arrangement for adjusting contents of the aggregated silica particles and the dried silica particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">The lower limit of the particle size of which content is adjusted is set to 1 μm, which is the maximum value of the machining allowance in the finish polishing step. Accordingly, as compared to an arrangement in which the lower limit is set to be higher than 1 μm, heights of the minute defects generated in the secondary polishing step are easily adjusted to 1 μm or less, thereby realizing effective finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">In addition, since the upper limit of the content to be adjusted is set to 3000 pcs/ml or less, the number of minute defects generated in the secondary polishing step can be controlled to a predetermined number or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Therefore, the semiconductor wafer W can be polished properly.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0192">(5) The slurry adjusting step includes: the stock-solution filtering step in which the first filter <b>251</b> filters the polishing-slurry stock solution; the secondary-polishing-prepared-solution producing step in which the secondary-polishing-prepared-solution producing section <b>252</b> produces the secondary-polishing-slurry prepared solution from the polishing-slurry stock solution filtered in the stock-solution filtering step; and a prepared-solution filtering step in which the second filter <b>253</b> filters the secondary-polishing-slurry prepared solution.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">Thus, with a simple arrangement for providing the first filter <b>251</b> and the second filter <b>253</b> to the slurry adjusting step, the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution can be adjusted as described above so as to properly polish the semiconductor wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">Even when the dried silica particles are generated while the stock solution feeder <b>210</b> stores the polishing-slurry stock solution, the dried silica particles having a predetermined size or larger are removed in the stock-solution filtering step, the number of dried silica particles contained in the secondary-polishing-slurry prepared solution produced in the secondary-polishing-prepared-solution producing step can be reduced. In addition, the size of dried silica particles which are difficult to be removed can be minimized. Therefore, as compared to an arrangement without the stock-solution filtering step, the number of dried silica particles to be captured in the prepared-solution filtering step can be reduced, so that clogging of the second filter <b>253</b> in the prepared-solution filtering step can be prevented, thereby effectively adjusting the secondary-polishing-slurry prepared solution.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0195">(6) The first filter <b>251</b> can capture the solid matters having the size equal to or more than fifty times as large as the primary particles of the silica contained in the polishing-slurry stock solution with the capturing efficiency of 99.99% or higher. While, the second filter <b>253</b> can capture the solid matters having the size equal to or more than ten times as large as the primary particles of the silica with the capturing efficiency of 99.99% or higher.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">Therefore, since the first filter <b>251</b> and the second filter <b>253</b> having the capturing performances as described above are used, the secondary-polishing-slurry prepared solution can be adjusted more effectively as compared to an arrangement using filters with other capturing performances.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0197">(7) The stock solution feeder <b>210</b> is hermetically sealed and the humidity of the internal space thereof is controller to be 99% or higher.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">Accordingly, generation of the dried silica particles at the boundary between an internal wall of the stock solution feeder <b>210</b> and the polishing-slurry stock solution can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Therefore, the number of dried silica particles contained in the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution can further be reduced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0280">[Advantages and Effects of Semiconductor Wafer Polishing Device]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0281">According to the above-described fourth embodiment, the following advantages and effects can be attained in addition to (4) in the second embodiment.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0291">(11) The slurry adjusting step includes the milling step for milling the dried silica particles and the like contained in the polishing-slurry collected solution using the bead mill <b>460</b>.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0282">Accordingly, by milling the dried silica particles contained in the polishing-slurry collected solution, the secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution that has been adjusted so that the number of dried silica particles having the particle size of 1 μm or larger is 3000 pcs/ml or less can be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0283">Since the bead mill <b>460</b> whose milling energy is the smallest is employed, hardness of the aggregated silica particles generated by the milling energy can be reduced as compared to an arrangement employing milling devices other than the bead mill <b>460</b>, thereby realizing more proper polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0284">In addition, the used polishing-slurry collected solution can be reused in the secondary polishing step, so that usage amount of the polishing-slurry stock solution can be reduced.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0295">(12) The lower limit of to-be-milled energy in the bead mill <b>460</b> is set to 20 kWh/dry kg or higher.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0285">Since the lower limit of the to-be-milled energy is set to 20 kWh/dry kg, the content of the dried silica particles in the secondary-polishing slurry prepared solution can be effectively adjusted to 3000 pcs/ml or less.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0286">Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, but various improvements and modifications of designs can be applied thereto without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0287">In the first embodiment, in the ultrasonic irradiating stage, the ultrasonic wave may be irradiated to the finish-slurry stock solution with its temperature being 40° C. or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0288">In the filtering stage, the finishing-slurry stock solution may be filtered after a predetermined time period has passed after the ultrasonic irradiation. Here, with an arrangement in which the finishing-slurry stock solution is filtered in three hours after the ultrasonic irradiation, it can be filtered before the silica particles having been dispersed by the ultrasonic wave are re-aggregated due to the effect of the water-soluble-polymer agent as in the first embodiment, so that clogging of the finishing filter <b>154</b> can be prevented more securely. However the finishing-slurry stock solution may be filtered after a lapse of more than three hours after the ultrasonic irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0289">As the ultrasonic irradiating section <b>152</b>, a so-called ultrasonic cleaner may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0290">There may also be employed an arrangement in which the number of dried silica particles contained in the finishing-slurry stock solution that has been filtered by the finishing filter <b>154</b> is counted by the liquid-borne particle counter, and the finishing-slurry stock solution is filtered again or fed to the finish polishing section <b>133</b> depending on the counting result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0291">In the second embodiment, a filter having a capturing efficiency different from those of the first filter <b>251</b> and the second filter <b>253</b> may be employed instead of the first filter <b>251</b> and the second filter <b>253</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0292">In the third embodiment, the centrifugal force of the centrifugal separator <b>351</b> may be set to higher than 10000 G. With such arrangement, although the polishing rate is lowered, the minute defects generated in the secondary polishing step can be controlled to a predetermined number or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0293">The slurry adjusting sections <b>250</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>450</b> may be combined arbitrarily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0294">The secondary-polishing-slurry adjusted solution produced in the slurry adjusting sections <b>250</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>450</b> may be fed to the primary polishing section <b>131</b>.
