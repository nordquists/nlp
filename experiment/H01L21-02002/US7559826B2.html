<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a wafer processing method in which a wafer is easily handled even if it is formed to be thin, and a grinding apparatus that can be used for performing the method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A wafer, on which a plurality of devices such as IC and LSI are formed on a surface side, is divided into individual devices using a dicing machine. The individual devices are incorporated in various electronic devices and widely used. To achieve size reduction or weight saving of an electronic device, a wafer before being divided into individual devices is held at the surface side by a chuck table of a grinding apparatus for grinding a backside to be formed in a thickness of, for example, 20 μm to 100 μm (for example, refer to JP-A-2004-319885).</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">However, there is a difficulty that such a wafer formed thin by grinding loses stiffness, and accordingly, it is difficult to handle or carry the wafer after grinding. For example, when a wafer after back grinding is removed from a holding table of the grinding apparatus, or when the wafer is divided into the individual devices, the wafer is not easily handled. Moreover, when a film of metal including gold, silver, or titanium is coated in a thickness of several ten nanometers on a back of the wafer having reduced thickness by the back grinding, it is also difficult to handle the wafer or carry the wafer between respective steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">It is desirable to facilitate handling of a wafer in processing or carrying even if the wafer is reduced in thickness by grinding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Embodiments of the invention include a processing method of a wafer and a grinding apparatus that can be used for the processing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The processing method of the wafer according to the present invention relates to a processing method of a wafer having a surface on which a device region having a plurality of devices formed therein and a peripheral surplus region enclosing the device region are formed, and includes at least a whole-back grinding process of grinding the whole back of the wafer to form a wafer having a predetermined thickness, and a back concave-grinding process of grinding a region corresponding to the device region in the back of the wafer after the whole-back grinding process to form a concave portion having a predetermined thickness, so that a ring-like reinforcement portion is formed about a periphery of the concave portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In the concave-grinding process, it is desirable that the wafer is held at a surface side by a chuck table of a grinding apparatus, then the chuck table is rotated in a way that a rotating grindstone is contacted to a rotation center of the wafer, and the grindstone is contacted to the back of the wafer such that the outermost circumference of a rotational orbit of the grindstone corresponds to an inner circumference of the ring-like reinforcement portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The wafer having the predetermined thickness in the whole-back grinding process desirably has a thickness of 300 μm to 400 μm, and the concave portion having the predetermined thickness in the concave-grinding process desirably has a thickness of 20 μm to 100 μm; however, these are not restrictive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">A film formation process of forming a film on the back of the wafer after the concave-grinding process may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The grinding apparatus of the wafer according to the present invention relates to a grinding apparatus for grinding a back surface of a wafer that has a surface including a device region having a plurality of devices formed therein and a peripheral surplus region enclosing the device region. The grinding apparatus includes at least a chuck table for rotatably and movably holding the wafer, a whole-back grinding unit for grinding the whole back of the wafer, and a device-region corresponding region grinding unit for grinding a region on the back corresponding to the device region to form a concave portion so that a ring-like reinforcement portion is formed about a periphery of the concave portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">A grindstone configuring the device-region corresponding region-grinding unit is desirably formed such that the grindstone is contacted to a rotation center of the wafer during grinding, and the outermost circumference of a rotational orbit corresponds to an inner circumference of the ring-like reinforcement portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">According to the processing method of the wafer of the invention, since the region of the back surface corresponding to the device region of the wafer is ground to form the concave portion so that the ring-like reinforcement portion is formed about the periphery of the concave portion, even if thickness of the device region is extremely reduced, the wafer is in a condition that the device region is reinforced at its periphery by the ring-like reinforcement portion. Accordingly, after forming the concave portion, the wafer can be easily removed from the grinding apparatus, and the wafer is easily handled in a subsequent step and in wafer carrying between respective steps. Furthermore, since the whole back is ground to provide the wafer with a predetermined thickness before forming the concave portion, the time required for forming the concave portion in the predetermined thickness is short, and consequently reduction in productivity can be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">When the grindstone is contacted to the rotation center of the wafer such that the outermost circumference of the rotational orbit of the grindstone corresponds to the inner circumference of the ring-like reinforcement portion to be formed, the ring-like reinforcement portion can be efficiently formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">When the film formation process for forming the film on the back of the wafer after the concave-grinding process is performed, the wafer is easily handled in the film formation process and before and after the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Since the grinding apparatus of the invention includes the chuck table that rotatably and movably holds the wafer, the whole-back grinding unit for grinding the whole back of the wafer, and the device-region corresponding region grinding unit for grinding the region of the back surface corresponding to the device region, the chuck table can be moved after the whole surface has been ground by the whole-back grinding unit so that the device-region corresponding region is ground by the device-region corresponding region grinding unit. Accordingly, two stages of grinding can be continuously performed by one grinding apparatus, and consequently grinding is efficiently performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Moreover, when the grindstone configuring the device-region corresponding region grinding unit is formed such that the grindstone is contacted to the rotation center of the wafer during grinding, and the outermost circumference of the rotational orbit corresponds to the inner circumference of the ring-like reinforcement portion, the ring-like reinforcement portion can be efficiently formed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The whole-back grinding unit <b>21</b> includes a spindle <b>210</b> having a vertical axis, housing <b>211</b> for rotatably supporting the spindle <b>210</b>, motor <b>212</b> connected to one end of the spindle <b>210</b>, wheel mount <b>213</b> provided at another end of the spindle <b>210</b>, grinding wheel <b>214</b> attached on the wheel mount <b>213</b>, and grindstone <b>215</b> fixed to a bottom of the grinding wheel <b>214</b>.

The unit <b>29</b> is configured in a way that the up-and-down plate <b>291</b> is moved up and down by the motor <b>292</b> while being guided by the guide rail <b>290</b>, and accordingly the whole-back grinding unit <b>21</b> fixed to the up-and-down plate <b>291</b> is also moved up and down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The device-region corresponding region grinding unit <b>22</b> includes a spindle <b>220</b> having a vertical axis, a housing <b>221</b> for rotatably supporting the spindle <b>220</b>, motor <b>222</b> connected to one end of the spindle <b>220</b>, wheel mount <b>223</b> provided at another end of the spindle <b>220</b>, grinding wheel <b>224</b> attached to the wheel mount <b>223</b>, and grindstone <b>225</b> fixed to a bottom of the grinding wheel <b>224</b>.

The grindstone <b>225</b> has an outer diameter of a rotational orbit smaller than that of the grindstone <b>215</b> configuring the whole-back grinding unit <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The device-region corresponding region-grinding unit <b>22</b> can be vertically moved by a second grind-feed unit <b>30</b>. The second grind-feed unit <b>30</b> includes a guide rail <b>300</b> arranged vertically, an up-and-down plate <b>301</b> slidably contacting the guide rail <b>300</b>, and a motor <b>302</b> for moving the plate <b>301</b> up and down.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">A plurality of wafers W having surfaces adhered with the protection members <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are stored in the first cassette <b>23</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then carried out from the first cassette <b>23</b> <i>a </i>by the carrying in/out unit <b>24</b> to the alignment unit <b>25</b>, and then the center of the wafer W is aligned to a fixed position, and then carried onto the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a </i>by the first carrying unit <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. On the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, the wafer W is held at a protection member <b>1</b> side and consequently formed into a condition in which the back Wb of the wafer W is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Next, the turntable <b>28</b> is rotated counterclockwise by a predetermined angle (90 degrees in a shown example) so that the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is moved to a position directly below the whole-back grinding unit <b>21</b>. Then, the wafer W is rotated with rotation of the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, and the first grinding unit <b>21</b> is lowered by downward grind-feed by the first grind-feed unit <b>29</b> with the grindstone <b>215</b> being rotated with rotation of the spindle <b>210</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rotating grindstone <b>215</b> is contacted to the whole surface of the back Wb of the wafer W and thus the whole surface of the relevant back is ground, so that the wafer W is formed in a predetermined thickness (whole-back grinding process). For example, when the thickness of the wafer W is 700 μm before grinding, it is decreased to about 300 to 400 μm by grinding of the whole back.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">When such grinding of the whole back by the whole-back grinding unit <b>21</b> is finished, the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is rotated counterclockwise by a predetermined angle, so that the wafer W is positioned directly below the device-region corresponding region grinding unit <b>22</b>. Then, the wafer W is rotated with rotation of the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, and the device-region corresponding region grinding unit <b>22</b> is lowered by downward grind-feed by the second grind-feed unit <b>30</b> with the grindstone <b>225</b> being rotated with rotation of the spindle <b>220</b>. Thus, the grindstone <b>225</b> is contacted to a region corresponding to a device region in the back Wb of the wafer W, that is, contacted to the back of the device region W<b>1</b>, and consequently grinding is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Here, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the grindstone <b>225</b> is formed to have a diameter of an outermost circumference of a rotational orbit, the diameter being larger than a radius of the device region W<b>1</b> and smaller than a diameter of the device region W<b>1</b>. The wafer is ground such that the grindstone <b>225</b> is contacted to the rotation center of the wafer W, and the outermost circumference of the rotational orbit of the grindstone <b>225</b> corresponds to an outer circumferential end of a concave portion W<b>3</b> to be formed. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the concave portion W<b>3</b> having a predetermined thickness is formed in a back side of the device region W<b>1</b>, and a ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> having the same thickness as that of the wafer at the end of the whole-back grinding process is formed about the periphery of the concave portion W<b>3</b> (back concave-grinding process). That is, an inner circumference of the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> approximately corresponds to the outermost circumference of the rotational orbit of the grindstone <b>225</b>. The thickness of the concave portion W<b>3</b> is designed to be, for example, about 20 to 100 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Since the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> has the same thickness as that of the wafer at the end of the whole back grinding process, even after the concave portion W<b>3</b> is formed to be extremely thin, the wafer W can be easily handled. For example, it is confirmed that when the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> has a thickness of about 300 to 400 μm, the wafer is handled without hindrance in subsequent carrying or in later steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> is formed in this way, and the turntable <b>28</b> is rotated counterclockwise at a predetermined angle so that the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is positioned near the second carrying unit <b>27</b> <i>b</i>. Then, the wafer W is carried into a cleaning unit <b>26</b> while being held by the second carrying unit <b>27</b> <i>b</i>. During carrying, a holder <b>271</b> <i>b </i>holds the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> by suction. Since the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> is formed comparatively thick, the wafer is easily handled when it is removed from the chuck table <b>20</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">After the wafer W is carried into the cleaning unit <b>26</b>, in which the wafer W is held on a holding table <b>260</b> with the back Wb being exposed, cleaning water is sprayed with the holding table <b>260</b> being rotated, to thereby remove grinding dust adhered to the back Wb. Then, a cleaned wafer W is carried out from the cleaning unit <b>26</b> by the carrying in/out unit <b>24</b>, and stored in the second cassette <b>23</b> <i>b</i>. Since the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> is formed comparatively thick, the wafer is easily handled when it is removed from the holding table <b>260</b> by the carrying in/out unit <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Grinding of another wafer stored in the first cassette <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is performed in the same manner as described above, and wafers having the ring-like reinforcement portions formed therein are sequentially stored in the second cassette <b>23</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">While the grinding apparatus <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes two grinding units, it may include at least three grinding units. For example, when the grinding apparatus includes three grinding units, it performs grinding by using a whole-back coarse-grinding unit for first coarse grinding of the whole back, a whole-back finish-grinding unit for subsequent finish grinding of the whole back, and the device-region corresponding region grinding unit for final grinding of the region corresponding to the device region W<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">On the back of the wafer W in which the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> is formed in the above manner, a film of metal including gold, silver or titanium may be formed. For formation of such a metal film, for example, low-pressure deposition apparatus <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be used. In the low-pressure deposition apparatus <b>4</b>, a holder <b>42</b> for holding the wafer W in an electrostatic manner is provided within a chamber <b>41</b>, and a sputter source <b>44</b> including metal is arranged while being held by an excitation member <b>43</b> in a position oppositely above the holder <b>42</b>. The sputter source <b>44</b> is connected with a high-frequency power supply <b>45</b>. In one side of the chamber <b>41</b>, an inlet <b>46</b> for introducing sputter gas is provided; and in the other side, a decompression port <b>47</b> communicating with a decompression source is provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The wafer is held on the holder <b>42</b> at the protection member <b>1</b> side in the electrostatic manner, such that the back of the wafer W is held oppositely to the sputter source <b>44</b>. When high frequency power of about 40 kHz is applied from the high-frequency power source <b>45</b> to the sputter source <b>44</b> magnetized by the excitation member <b>43</b>, the inside of the chamber <b>41</b> is decompressed to about 10<sup>−2 </sup>Pa to 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa through the decompression port <b>47</b> to create a low-pressure environment, and argon gas is introduced from the inlet <b>46</b> to generate plasma, argon ions in the plasma impact the sputter source <b>44</b> and thus particles are sputtered and deposited on the back of the wafer W, such that a metal film <b>5</b> is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The metal film <b>5</b> has a thickness of, for example, about 30 to 60 nm. When the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> is subjected to masking, the metal film <b>5</b> is formed only on the concave portion W<b>3</b> (film formation process). While the film formation process is performed under a condition that the back of the device region W<b>1</b> has been reduced in thickness by grinding, since the wafer W has the ring-like reinforcement portion W<b>4</b> formed therein, the wafer is easily handled during the film formation process. The film formation process can also be performed by evaporation, CVD and the like.</div>
