<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a rough-polishing method of a semiconductor wafer and a polishing apparatus of a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In a polishing process of a semiconductor wafer, in order to average the roughness of the entire surface of a the semiconductor wafer with etching pits and the like formed during preceding (etching) process, a rough-polishing step is often conducted before final finish-polishing step. During the rough-polishing step, the surface of the semiconductor wafers undergoes one-stage polishing, or, alternatively, multi-stage polishing using different polishing slurries in accordance with the depth of the etching pits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">By the rough-polishing step, the surface of the semiconductor wafer is smoothed to a constant roughness. In the finish-polishing step, the constant surface roughness is removed to create further minute surface roughness condition (Haze).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In order to remove the surface roughness formed during the rough-polishing process by the finish polishing, considerable amount of work is necessary during the finish polishing. The surface roughness of the semiconductor wafer during the rough-polishing step is caused by transcription of polishing pad attached on a polishing table. Accordingly, by further smoothing the polishing pad during the rough-polishing step, the surface roughness of the semiconductor wafer after the rough-polishing step can be made constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In view of the above, it has been traditionally known to apply a seasoning process on the surface of polishing pad using a diamond grinding stone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Alternatively, it has been proposed to gradually raise rotating speed of polishing table during rough-polishing step (see, for instance, Document: JP2000-15571 A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, when a seasoning process is applied before rough-polishing, since the most appropriate polishing condition for a polishing pad of which condition is constantly changing differs at each time, it is difficult to stably obtain a constant surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Further, when a seasoning process is frequently conducted in order to stabilize the surface roughness of semiconductor wafer, productivity of the semiconductor wafer is deteriorated during polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">On the other hand, when a rotating speed of a polishing table is gradually raised during rough-polishing, since polishing table is thermally expanded on account of frictional heat generated against semiconductor wafers, it becomes difficult to keep the flatness of semiconductor wafers.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">An object of the present invention is to provide a polishing method and a polishing apparatus of a semiconductor wafer, in which surface roughness of semiconductor wafer can be stabilized during a rough-polishing step and a finish-polishing step can be efficiently conducted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">A rough-polishing method of a semiconductor wafer according to an aspect of the present invention is conducted before mirror-finish polishing of the semiconductor wafer for processing an etched surface of the semiconductor wafer to a constant roughness, the method including: polishing the surface of the semiconductor wafer while, in a continuous or phased manner, changing a polishing solution from slurry containing colloidal silica to an alkali solution in accordance with progress of the polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In changing the slurry to the alkali solution, the supplying amount of the slurry may be gradually decreased and the amount of the deionized water may be gradually increased and the semiconductor wafer is rinsed solely by deionized water for a predetermined time before supplying the alkali solution. Alternatively, the supply of the slurry is completely shut and the semiconductor wafer is rinsed by deionized water and, thereafter, the alkali solution may be mixed into the deionized water to be supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">According to the above arrangement, sufficient polishing rate can be secured at an initial stage by slurry-polishing, which is transitioned into alkali-solution polishing in a continuous or phased manner to conduct the polishing with small amount of colloidal silica to even the roughness on the surface of the semiconductor wafer. Incidentally, even when only the alkali solution is supplied, since the silica of the slurry is entangled in the polishing pad in the polishing step, the semiconductor wafer can be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In the above aspect of the invention, the polishing preferably include: a first polishing step for polishing the surface of the semiconductor wafer with the slurry containing colloidal silica; and a second polishing step for polishing the surface of the semiconductor wafer with the alkali solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In this case, the second polishing step preferably employs at least one of KOH, NaOH, LiOH and TMAH (TetramethylAmmonium Hydroxide) as the alkali solution and is preferably conducted at a pH value from pH10 or more to less than pH12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">According to the above arrangement, since the process can be transitioned into the second polishing step while checking the polishing level of the surface of the semiconductor wafer by the first polishing step, it is possible to secure necessary polishing level necessary for rough-polishing in the first polishing step and the surface of the semiconductor wafer can be evened at a constant roughness in the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Further, since the above-listed alkali is used as the alkali solution and the pH value is set within a range of 10-12 in the second polishing step, the roughness of the surface of the semiconductor wafer can be further stabilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Further, the pH of the alkali solution in the second polishing step is preferably determined based on a root means square roughness of the surface of the semiconductor wafer after the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The root means square roughness may be determined as a value measured in accordance with, for instance, JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) B0601.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">According to the above arrangement, since the pH of the alkali solution in the second polishing step is determined after checking the surface roughness of the semiconductor wafer after the first polishing step, the second polishing step can be conducted after accurately recognizing the polishing condition in the preceding step, so that the surface roughness in the rough-polishing step can be further securely stabilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">When the rough-polishing is conducted in two-stages, i.e. the first polishing step and the second polishing step, it is preferable that a drive current value of a polishing table of a polishing apparatus for polishing the semiconductor wafer in the first polishing step is detected, a load current of the polishing table is calculated based on the detected drive current of the polishing table, and the pH value of the alkali solution in the second polishing step is determined based on the calculated load current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Specifically, in order to determine the pH value of the alkali solution in the second polishing step, it is preferable that the pH value of the alkali solution is calculated according to the following equation (1), where the root mean square roughness of the surface of the semiconductor wafer in the first polishing step is Rq, the load current value of the polishing table is I, the pH value of the slurry is SpH, the pH value of the alkali solution in the second polishing step is ApH and polishing time in the second polishing step is t,
<br/>
<i>Rq=C</i>(<i>I−Ao</i>)*10<sup>(−λ(SpH−ApH)t)</sup>  (1)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">and where C and Ao are constant, and λ is an empirically-calculated correction coefficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">According to the above arrangement, since the pH value of the alkali solution in the second polishing step can be calculated by the equation (1) only by calculating the load current of the polishing table in the first polishing step, the condition of the second polishing step can be easily determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A polishing apparatus of a semiconductor wafer for polishing a semiconductor wafer according to another aspect of the present invention includes: a polishing table rotated by a drive current and provided with a polishing pad; a slurry-supplying unit for supplying polishing slurry to the polishing table; a controller for controlling the polishing table and the slurry-supplying unit, the semiconductor wafer being pressed onto the polishing table and being polished by the slurry supplied by the slurry-supplying unit; an alkali-concentrate-solution supplying unit for supplying an alkali concentrate solution to the polishing table; a deionized-water supplying unit for supplying deionized water to the polishing table; a flow-regulating valve that adjusts the flow rate of the alkali concentrate solution from the alkali-concentrate-solution supplying unit; and a drive current detecting unit that detects the drive current to the polishing table, the controller includes: a load current calculating unit that calculates a load current generated on the polishing table while polishing using the slurry based on the drive current detected by the drive current detecting unit; a pH value calculating unit that calculates a pH value of an alkali solution supplied from the flow-regulating valve to the polishing table, the alkali solution being prepared by mixing the alkali concentrate solution and the deionized water, and a flow control unit for controlling the flow rate of the flow-regulating valve based on the calculated pH value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The pH value by the pH calculating unit is preferably calculated in accordance with the above-mentioned equation (1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">According to the above aspect, since the automatic control by an arithmetic processing by the controller is possible, the rough-processing method of the semiconductor wafer according to the above aspect of the present invention can be automatically conducted by an polishing apparatus, thereby considerably reducing the workload.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In the above, when a pH value detecting unit for detecting the pH value of the alkali solution to be supplied to the polishing table is provided on a downstream of the flow-regulating valve, the controller preferably includes a command control unit that adjusts a control command from the flow control unit based on the pH value detected by the pH value detecting unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">According to the above arrangement, since the pH value of the alkali solution supplied by the flow control unit is detected and the ratio of alkali concentrate solution and deionized water to be allocated by the flow control unit can be adjusted by the command control unit, the pH value of the alkali solution can be further securely managed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">After completing the polishing of the semiconductor wafer W by the slurry supplied from the slurry-supplying unit <b>4</b> to the polishing table <b>2</b>, the deionized-water supplying unit <b>5</b> supplies deionized water for rinsing.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The aspirator <b>51</b> reduces the pressure inside the pipework from the alkali-concentrate-solution supplying unit <b>6</b> when the deionized water flows through inside of the pipework to mix alkali concentrate solution with the deionized water.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The flow-regulating valve <b>61</b> is an electromagnetic-control valve that changes flow rate based on a control command from the controller <b>8</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The drive current detector <b>7</b> detects the electric current value supplied to the motor <b>21</b> that rotates the table body <b>22</b>. The detected current value is outputted to the controller <b>8</b> as an electric signal.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">On the other hand, when the second polishing step S<b>52</b> is conducted using a new polishing cloth <b>23</b>, it is confirmed that the polishing rate in the second polishing step S<b>52</b> is considerably reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Further, the micro-roughness Rq in the rough-polishing step affects on surface LPD (Light-Point Defect). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. it is confirmed that the magnitude of the micro-roughness Rq is approximately in proportion to the number of DIC (Differential-Interference Contrast) measured by a particle counter SP<b>1</b> (manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Accordingly, by the rough-polishing of the semiconductor wafer W with the first polishing step S<b>51</b> and the second polishing step S<b>52</b>, the surface LPD measured by a particle counter SP<b>1</b> can be considerably reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">[4] Modification of Embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Incidentally, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, but includes the following modifications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In the above embodiment, the rough-polishing is conducted in two stages, i.e. the first polishing step S<b>51</b> for polishing the semiconductor wafer W with the slurry and a second polishing step S<b>52</b> for polishing the semiconductor wafer W with an alkali solution. However, the rough-polishing may be conducted without providing clear distinction between the two steps: for instance, the slurry-polishing may be continuously transitioned into the alkali-solution polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Though the rough-polishing of the semiconductor wafer according to the present invention is conducted with a sheet-feed polishing apparatus <b>1</b>, the rough-polishing method of the present invention may be applied to a double-side polishing apparatus in which a plurality of semiconductor wafers are housed within a carrier and both sides of the plurality of semiconductor wafers are polished at a time by rotating the carrier using an inner gear and an outer gear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Specific process and structure for implementing the present invention may be altered as long as an object of the present invention can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The priority application Number JP 2006-267286 upon which this patent application is based is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
