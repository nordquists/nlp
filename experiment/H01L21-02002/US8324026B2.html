<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is a divisional of parent U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/362,142 filed on Jan. 29, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,071,427, by Phillip Celaya et al., titled “Method for Manufacturing a Semiconductor Component and Structure Therefor,” having publication number US 2010/0187663 A1, and publication date of Jul. 29, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and priority thereto for common subject matter is hereby claimed.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates, in general, to semiconductor components and, more particularly, to semiconductor component support structures.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Semiconductor devices are typically manufactured from a semiconductor wafer. The wafer is diced to form chips or dice, which are mounted to a substrate such as a leadframe. The leadframe is then placed in a mold and a portion of the leadframe is encapsulated in a mold compound whereas another portion of the leadframe remains unencapsulated. The leadframe leads are plated with tin and cut to separate the substrate into individual semiconductor components. A drawback with this approach is that cutting the leadframe leads leaves exposed portions of the leadframe material. The exposed portions may not wet during surface mount processes leading to corrosion creep during extreme atmospheric conditions such as those within an automotive engine compartment. In addition, the exposed portions of the leadframes may form unreliable solder joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a semiconductor component having leadframe leads with improved wetability and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor component. It would be of further advantage for the semiconductor component to be cost efficient to manufacture.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of a semiconductor component <b>10</b> during manufacture in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. What is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are leadframe leads <b>12</b> and a leadframe flag <b>14</b> of a leadframe <b>16</b> partially embedded in a mold compound <b>18</b>, which has sides <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> and edges or side surfaces <b>22</b>. Leadframe leads <b>12</b> and leadframe flag <b>14</b> protrude or extend from side <b>20</b>. Preferably, lead frame <b>16</b> is copper. However, this is not a limitation of the present invention. Other suitable materials for leadframe <b>16</b> include copper alloys, steel, iron, or the like. Leadframe leads <b>12</b> are shown as being rectangular cuboids having side surfaces <b>24</b> and end surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Leadframe flag <b>14</b> is a rectangular cuboid having side surfaces <b>30</b>, end surfaces <b>32</b>, and extensions <b>34</b> extending from end surfaces <b>32</b>. The shapes of the leadframe flag and leadframe leads are not limited to having a rectangular cuboid shape. Other shapes for the leadframe flag and leadframe leads include circular, oval, square, triangular, pentagonal, or any other geometric shape. Extensions <b>34</b> have end surfaces <b>38</b>. A layer of electrically conductive material <b>40</b> is formed over leadframe leads <b>12</b> and flag <b>14</b>. Electrically conductive material <b>40</b> may be tin, lead, solder, a combination of tin and lead, or the like. Electrically conductive material <b>40</b> is absent from end surfaces <b>26</b> of leadframe leads <b>12</b> and end surfaces <b>38</b> of extensions <b>34</b>. Thus, end surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> are exposed regions of leadframe leads <b>12</b>. When leadframe <b>16</b> is copper, end surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> are exposed regions of copper. By way of example, end surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> are exposed when semiconductor components <b>10</b> are separated or singulated from a leadframe strip (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an electrically conductive material <b>42</b> is formed on electrically conductive layer <b>40</b> and on end surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> using, for example, a barrel plating process. Layers <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In accordance with an embodiment, the material of electrically conductive layer <b>42</b> is tin. The material of electrically conductive layer <b>42</b> is not a limitation of the present invention. Other suitable materials for electrically conductive layer <b>42</b> include lead; solder; a combination of tin and lead; silver; nickel; a combination of nickel, lead, and gold; or the like. Similarly, the method for forming electrically conductive layer <b>42</b> is not a limitation of the present invention. Other suitable methods for forming electrically conductive layer <b>42</b> include electroplating, electroless plating, wave soldering, a hot solder dip, vapor deposition, sputter deposition, or the like. Layer of electrically conductive material <b>42</b> may cover or partially cover surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b>. An advantage of forming layers of electrically conductive material <b>42</b> is that it forms a wetable material over surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of semiconductor component <b>10</b> taken along section line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates leadframe leads <b>12</b>, flag <b>14</b>, and electrically conductive layers <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. For the sake of completeness, a semiconductor chip <b>62</b> is shown as being mounted to leadframe flag <b>14</b> through a die attach material <b>63</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top view of a portion of an electrically conductive support <b>51</b> having device or component receiving areas <b>52</b>, interconnect structures <b>54</b>, structural support members <b>56</b>, <b>56</b>A, and <b>57</b>, and opposing sides <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> (opposing side <b>60</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) used in the manufacture of semiconductor components <b>50</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Interconnect structures <b>54</b> are also referred to as electrical interconnect structures or electrically conductive interconnect structures. It should be noted that the term top view is used for the sake of clarity and to distinguish the side of electrically conductive support <b>51</b> to which one or more active circuit elements or one or more passive circuit elements is mounted. In accordance with an embodiment, electrically conductive support <b>51</b> is a leadframe, interconnect structures <b>52</b> are flags, interconnect structures <b>54</b> are leadframe leads, support members <b>56</b> and <b>56</b>A are tie bars, and support members <b>57</b> are rails. By way of example, semiconductor chips or dice <b>62</b> are coupled to side <b>58</b> of leadframe <b>51</b> through a die attach material <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). More particularly, a semiconductor chip <b>62</b> is mounted to each flag <b>52</b> through the die attach material. Semiconductor chips <b>62</b> have bond pads <b>66</b> that are coupled to corresponding leadframe leads <b>54</b> through bond wires <b>68</b>. Bond wires are also referred to as wirebonds. The number of flags and leadframe leads and their shapes are not limitations of the present invention. Although semiconductor chips <b>62</b> have been described as being mounted to flags <b>52</b>, the embodiments are not limited in this respect. Passive circuit elements such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors as well as active circuit elements such as semiconductor chips comprising transistors may be coupled to or mounted on leadframe <b>51</b> in place of or in addition to semiconductor chips <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a bottom view of a portion of leadframe <b>51</b> after a mold compound <b>70</b> has been formed over semiconductor chips <b>62</b> and wirebonds <b>68</b> to form a molded leadframe strip <b>72</b> is shown. It should be understood that mold compound <b>70</b> is formed over side <b>58</b>, i.e., the top side, leaving side <b>60</b> substantially free of mold compound and that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a bottom view of leadframe <b>51</b>. It should be further understood that referring to the views shown in the figures as top views and bottom views and the designation of a view as being a top view or a bottom view is merely to facilitate describing embodiments of the present invention. Broken lines <b>79</b> indicate where portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> will be separated and exposed. Broken lines <b>79</b> also indicate the regions in which tie bars <b>56</b> are removed. Separating and exposing leadframe leads <b>54</b> and removing tie bars <b>56</b> are further described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of molded leadframe strip <b>72</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at a later stage of manufacture. What is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is leadframe <b>51</b> after portions have been removed. More particularly, portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> are removed to form cavities <b>76</b> having sidewalls <b>78</b>. By way of example, the portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> are removed by partially sawing into leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b>. Preferably, the thickness of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> that are removed ranges from about 50 percent (%) to about 100% of the thicknesses of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b>. However, the thicknesses of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> that are removed may be less than 50% and equal to or greater than 100% of their thicknesses. In accordance with an embodiment, about three-fourths of the thickness of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> is removed. Suitable techniques for removing the portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> include sawing, cutting, etching, stamping, punching, or the like. The regions at which the portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> are removed are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and identified by broken lines <b>79</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a layer of electrically conductive material <b>80</b> having a thickness ranging from about 0.5 microinches (12.7 nanometers) to about 3,000 microinches (76.2 micrometers) is formed on leadframe leads <b>54</b>, including the portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> within cavities <b>76</b>. In accordance with an embodiment, electrically conductive material <b>80</b> is tin formed by an electroplating process. The type of electrically conductive material and the method for forming the electrically conductive material are not limitations of the present invention. Other suitable materials for electrically conductive layer <b>80</b> include silver; nickel; a combination of nickel, lead, and gold; or the like. Similarly, the method for forming electrically conductive layer <b>80</b> is not a limitation of the present invention. Other suitable methods for forming electrically conductive layer <b>80</b> include electroplating, electroless plating, wave soldering, a hot solder dip, vapor deposition, sputter deposition, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Although the examples for the material for electrically conductive layer <b>80</b> have been metals, this is not a limitation of the present invention. For example, layer <b>80</b> may be a conductive epoxy. Alternatively, an anti-oxidizing coating or agent may be formed over leadframe leads <b>54</b> and on the exposed portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b>. These types of coatings are electrically non-conductive materials that inhibit the oxidation of metals such as copper at room temperature. During the formation of solder over leadframe leads <b>54</b>, the anti-oxidizing coating evaporates allowing solder to form on the exposed portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b>. The anti-oxidizing coating leaves a clean wetable copper surface after it has evaporated to which solder can adhere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, portions of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and tie bars <b>56</b> remaining in cavities <b>76</b> are removed exposing sidewall portions <b>82</b> of leadframe leads <b>54</b> and portions of mold compound <b>70</b>, and singulating molded leadframe strip <b>72</b> into individual semiconductor components <b>50</b>. In embodiments in which cavities <b>76</b> are formed using a sawing process and molded leadframe strip <b>72</b> is singulated using a sawing process, preferably the width of the saw blade used to singulate molded leadframe strip <b>72</b> is less than the width of the saw blade used to form cavities <b>76</b>. The remaining portions of electrically conductive layer <b>80</b> provide a wetable material over portions of the surfaces of leadframe leads <b>54</b>.</div>
