<heading>FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The invention relates to a method for producing a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">According to the prior art, semiconductor wafers are produced in a large number of successive process steps which can generally be divided into the following groups:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">a) production of a single crystal consisting of semiconductor material (crystal pulling);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">b) separation of the semiconductor single crystal into individual wafers (“wafering”, “slicing”);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">c) mechanical processing of the semiconductor wafers;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">d) chemical processing of the semiconductor wafers;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">e) chemo-mechanical processing of the semiconductor wafers;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">f) thermal treatment of the semiconductor wafers and/or epitaxial coating of the semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In addition to this, there are a large number of secondary steps, such as cleaning, measuring and packaging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">A semiconductor single crystal is usually produced by pulling a single crystal out of a melt (CZ or “Czochralski” method) or by the recrystallisation of a rod of polycrystalline semiconductor material (FZ or “floating zone” method).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Wire sawing (“multi-wire slicing”, MWS) and inner diameter sawing are known as cutting methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In wire sawing, a plurality of semiconductor wafers is cut off from a piece of crystal in one operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The purpose of mechanical processing is to remove sawing undulations, to remove the surface layers which have been crystal-damaged by the relatively rough sawing processes or have been contaminated by the sawing wire and in particular to comprehensively level the semiconductor wafers. Surface grinding (single-side, double-side) and lapping are known in this respect, as are mechanical edge processing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In single-side grinding, the back of the semiconductor wafer is held on a support (“chuck”) and the front is levelled by a cup wheel with the rotation of the chuck and grinding wheel and with a slow radial advance. Methods and devices for the surface grinding of a semiconductor wafer are known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 3,905,162 and from U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,548 or from EP-0955126. In these documents, a semiconductor wafer is secured by one surface on a wafer holder, while the opposite surface is worked by a grinding wheel, in that the wafer holder and grinding wheel rotate and are pressed against one another. In this respect, the semiconductor wafer is attached on the wafer holder such that the centre thereof substantially coincides with the centre of rotation of the wafer holder. Furthermore, the grinding wheel is positioned such that the centre of rotation of the semiconductor wafer passes into a working region or into the peripheral region, formed by teeth, of the grinding wheel. As a result, the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer can be ground without any movement in the grinding plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In simultaneous double-side grinding (“double-disc grinding”, DDG), the semiconductor wafer is simultaneously worked on both sides in a free-floating manner between two grinding wheels which are mounted on opposite collinear spindles and is guided axially in a manner, substantially free from constraining forces, between a water cushion (hydrostatic principle) or air cushion (aerostatic principle) which acts on the front and on the back and is prevented from floating away in a radially loose manner by a surrounding thin guide ring or by individual radial spokes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In lapping, the semiconductor wafers are moved under a specific pressure between an upper and a lower working wheel which mostly consist of steel and are usually provided with channels for an improved distribution of the abrasives, with the supply of a suspension (slurry) containing abrasive substances, as a result of which semiconductor material is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">DE 103 44 602 A1 and DE 10 2006 032 455 A1 describe methods for simultaneously grinding both sides of a plurality of semiconductor wafers with a sequence of movements similar to that of lapping, but they are characterised in that an abrasive is used which is firmly bound into working layers (“films, cloths”) applied onto the working wheels. A method of this type is termed “fine grinding with lap kinematics” or “planetary pad grinding” (PPG).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Working layers which are used in PPG and are bonded onto the two working wheels are described in, for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,407 A and U.S. Pat. No. 6,599,177 B2. During processing, the semiconductor wafers are introduced into thin guide cages, so-called runner wheels which have suitable openings for receiving the semiconductor wafers. The runner wheels have outer teeth which engage into a roll-off device consisting of an inner and an outer toothed ring and are moved by said roll-off device in the working gap formed between the upper and lower working wheel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The edge of the semiconductor wafer including mechanical marks which may be present, such as an orientation notch, is usually also processed (edge rounding, “edge-notch-grinding”). Conventional grinding steps using profiled grinding wheels or belt grinding methods with continuous or periodic tool feed are used for this purpose. These edge rounding methods are used, since in the unworked state, the edge is particularly susceptible to breaking and the semiconductor wafer can be damaged by slight pressure and/or temperature loads in said edge region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In a later processing step, the edge of the wafer which has been ground and treated with an etching medium is usually polished. In this respect, the edge of a centrally rotating semiconductor wafer is pressed against a centrally rotating polishing drum with a specific force (contact pressure). U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,105 discloses a method of this type for edge polishing in which the polishing drum consists of an aluminium alloy and is covered by a polishing cloth. The semiconductor wafer is usually fixed on a flat wafer holder, a so-called chuck. The edge of the semiconductor wafer projects over the chuck, so that it is freely accessible to the polishing drum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The group of chemical processing steps usually includes wet-chemical cleaning and etching steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The group of chemo-mechanical processing steps includes polishing steps, by which the surface is smoothed partly by a chemical reaction and partly by a mechanical material removal (abrasion), and residual damage to the surface is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Whereas single-side polishing methods (“single-side polishing”) usually result in relatively poor plane parallelisms, bilaterally engaging polishing methods (“double-side polishing”) produce semiconductor wafers with an improved evenness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">After the grinding, cleaning and etching steps, according to the prior art the surface of the semiconductor wafers is smoothed by strip polishing. In single-side polishing (SSP), the back of a semiconductor wafer is held on a support plate by putty, vacuum or by adhesion during processing. In double-side polishing (DSP), semiconductor wafers are introduced loosely into a thin toothed wheel and are polished simultaneously on the front and back, while they “float freely” between an upper and a lower polishing disc covered by a polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Furthermore, the fronts of the semiconductor wafers are often polished in a haze-free manner, for example with a soft polishing cloth using an alkaline polishing solution. In the literature, this step is often called CMP polishing (“chemo-mechanical polishing”). CMP methods are disclosed in, for example US 2002-0077039 and in US 2008-0305722.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Also known in the prior art are the so-called “fixed abrasive polishing” (FAP) technologies in which the silicon wafer is polished on a polishing cloth which contains an abrasive bound in the polishing cloth (“fixed-abrasive pad”). A polishing step in which an FAP polishing cloth of this type is used will be abbreviated in the following to an FAP step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">WO 99/55491 A1 describes a two-stage polishing method, with a first FAP polishing step and a subsequent second CMP polishing step. In CMP, the polishing cloth does not contain any bound abrasive. Here, as in a DSP step, abrasive is introduced as a suspension between the silicon wafer and the polishing cloth. A two-stage polishing method of this type is used in particular to remove scratches left behind on the polished surface of the substrate by the FAP step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">German patent application DE 102 007 035 266 A1 describes a method for polishing a substrate consisting of silicon material, the method comprising two FAP-type polishing steps which differ in that, in one polishing step, a polish suspension containing unbound abrasive as solids is introduced between the substrate and the polishing cloth, while in the second polishing step, a polish solution which is free from solids is used instead of the polish suspension.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Semiconductor wafers are often provided with an epitaxial layer, i.e. with a monocrystalline grown-on layer having the same crystal orientation, on which semiconductor components are applied at a later stage. Epitaxially coated or epitaxed semiconductor wafers of this type have particular advantages over semiconductor wafers consisting of homogeneous material, for example the prevention of a charge reversal in bipolar CMOS circuits followed by a short circuit of the component (“latch-up problem”), lower defect densities (for example a reduced number of COPs (“crystal-originated particles”) and the absence of a significant oxygen content, as a result of which the risk of a short circuit due to oxygen precipitates in component-relevant regions can be ruled out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">It is crucial how the previously described mechanical and chemo-mechanical or purely chemical procedural steps are ordered in a process sequence for the production of a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">It is known that the polishing steps such as SSP, DSP and CMP, the etching treatments and the epitaxy step produce a deterioration in the evenness of the semiconductor wafer, particularly in the peripheral region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Therefore, attempts have been made in the prior art to keep the removal of material during polishing as low as possible to also keep the deterioration in the evenness to a minimum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">It is proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 5942445 A to separate a semiconductor wafer from the crystal (sawing), to round off the edge of the semiconductor wafer, to then carry out a grinding step which can comprise a double-side grinding and a single-side grinding of the front and back of the semiconductor wafer, to subject the semiconductor wafer to an alkaline wet etching procedure and finally to polish the semiconductor wafer by DSP. The double-side grinding can also be replaced by a lapping step. Plasma etching can also be carried out following the wet etching procedure. Finally, the grinding steps and the wet etching procedure can be replaced by plasma etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The semiconductor wafers which are polished by DSP and can be obtained by this method have an unsatisfactory shape in the peripheral region due to the use of wet-chemical treatments and to plasma-assisted chemical etching (PACE). Thus, semiconductor wafers with acceptable evenness values are at best available when a peripheral exclusion of at least 2 mm is always taken as a basis, cf. ITRS “Roadmap”. In particular, the nano-topology is adversely affected by etching processes. In order to improve the nano-topology after the etching step, in DSP an increased removal of material is necessary which in turn, however, adversely affects the shape in the peripheral region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Other approaches are required in order to be able to provide semiconductor wafers for future technology generations, which wafers satisfy the high demands made on the edge region of the semiconductor wafer, thus for example to also make available the outermost peripheral region of the wafer to modern lithographic methods (immersion lithography).</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a novel process sequence for the production of semiconductor wafers which particularly have a diameter of 450 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In an embodiment, this can be achieved by a method for the production of a semiconductor wafer, the method comprising these steps in the following sequence:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">(a) bilateral material-removing processing step of the semiconductor wafer, separated from a single crystal;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">(b) rounding off the edge of the semiconductor wafer;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">(c) grinding the front and back of the semiconductor wafer, in each case one side of the semiconductor wafer being held by a wafer holder, while the other side is worked by a grinding tool;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">(d) polishing at least one side of the semiconductor wafer with a polishing cloth which contains firmly bound abrasives;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">(e) treating both sides of the semiconductor wafer with an etching medium with a material removal of not more than 1 μm per side of the semiconductor wafer;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">(f) polishing the front of the semiconductor wafer using a polishing cloth having firmly bound abrasives and simultaneously polishing the back of the semiconductor wafer using a polishing cloth which does not contain any abrasives, in which step, however, a polish containing abrasives is introduced between the polishing cloth and the back of the semiconductor wafer;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">(g) polishing the edge of the semiconductor wafer;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">(h) polishing the back of the semiconductor wafer using a polishing cloth containing firmly bound abrasives and simultaneously polishing the front of the semiconductor wafer using a polishing cloth which does not contain any firmly bound abrasives, a polish containing abrasives being introduced between the polishing cloth and the front of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">First of all, a semiconductor wafer is separated from a single crystal which has been grown using CZ or FZ and consists of semiconductor material. The semiconductor wafer is preferably separated by a wire saw. The semiconductor wafer is separated by a wire saw in the manner known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 4655191, EP 522 542 A1, DE 39 42 671 A1 or EP 433 956 A1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The grown single crystal of semiconductor material is preferably a single crystal of silicon. The semiconductor wafer is preferably a monocrystalline silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In the following, the basic steps of the method according to the invention and the preferred configurations thereof will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">Step (a)—Bilateral Material-removing Processing Step of the Semiconductor Wafer, Separated from a Single Crystal</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In step (a) of the method according to the invention, both sides of the semiconductor wafer are processed such that material is removed therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">This can be carried out by means of simultaneous double-disc grinding (DDG) or by PPG (planetary pad grinding). A lapping step is less preferred in the method according to the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Prior art DDG machines, as described, for example in JP2000-280155A and JP2002-307303A, have two opposing grinding wheels, the axes of rotation of which are arranged collinearly. During the grinding procedure, a wafer-shaped workpiece, positioned between the grinding wheels, is simultaneously worked on both sides by the two grinding wheels which rotate about their axes, while the workpiece is held in position by an annular retaining and rotating means and is simultaneously rotated about its own axis. During the grinding procedure, the two grinding wheels are advanced in the axial direction until the desired final thickness of the workpiece is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The retaining and rotating means can comprise, for example friction wheels which engage on the edge of the workpiece. However, it can also be a means which annularly surrounds the workpiece and engages into a channel, groove or notch which is possibly on the periphery of the workpiece. A means of this type is usually termed a “notch finger”. To work the entire surface of the workpiece, said workpiece is guided relative to the grinding wheels such that the abrasive grinding segments of the grinding wheels describe a circular path which runs consistently over the centre of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The workpiece is not usually firmly fixed, but is held axially in position by two devices for a hydrostatic mounting, termed “hydropads” which are attached to both sides of the workpiece. Devices of this type are described in JP2000-280155A. According to the prior art, the surfaces, facing the workpiece, of the two hydropads are planar and are aligned parallel to one another. Each hydropad comprises a plurality of hydrostatic bearings, between which grooves are arranged for removing the medium used for the hydrostatic mounting (hereafter called “hydro-bearing medium”) and the grinding coolant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Integrated into the hydropads are respectively one or more measuring sensors which allow a measurement of the distance between the surface of the hydropads and the surface of the workpiece during the grinding procedure. This distance measurement is usually carried out as a pneumatic dynamic pressure measurement using dynamic pressure nozzles. The dynamic pressure nozzles are configured as simple holes in the edges of the hydrostatic bearings which form the guide surfaces. In order to be able to measure the distance between the hydropads and the workpiece as closely as possible to the location of the grinding work, the dynamic pressure nozzles are generally attached closely to the edge of the hydropads which is adjacent to the grinding wheels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">PPG is a method for the simultaneous bilateral grinding of a plurality of semiconductor wafers, where each semiconductor wafer is positioned, being freely movable, in a recess in one of several runner wheels set into rotation by a roll-off device and is thus moved on a cycloidal curved path, the semiconductor wafers being processed between two rotating working wheels such that material is removed from the wafers and each working wheel comprising a working layer which contains bound abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The use of a PPG method in step (a) of the method according to the invention is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The semiconductor wafer to be processed by PPG preferably already has a rounded edge, but after the PPG step, it is again subjected to an edge rounding procedure of this type. It has been found that a two-part edge rounding step of this type affords advantages, especially as in the case of semiconductor wafers with rounded edges, the PPG method obviously produces semiconductor wafers with an improved shape and nano-topography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">A hard material with a Mohs hardness ≧6 is preferred as the abrasive bound into the working layers. The following are preferably included as abrasive substances: diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2), corundum (aluminium oxide, Al2O3), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), boron nitride (BN; cubic boron nitride, CBN), also silicon dioxide (SiO2), boron carbide (B4C) right up to substantially softer substances such as barium carbonate (BaCO3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). However, diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminium oxide, Al2O3; corundum) are particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The average grain size of the abrasive should be below 9 μm. The preferred size of the abrasive grains bound in the working layers when diamond is the abrasive is on average 0.1 to 9 μm and more preferably 0.1 to 6 μm. The diamonds are preferably bound individually or as clusters in the binding matrix of the working layer. When there is a cluster formation, the grain diameters, stated as being preferred, relate to the primary particle size of the cluster constituents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Working layers with a ceramic bond are preferably used, a synthetic resin bond being particularly preferred; in the case of working layers with clusters, also a hybrid-bonded system (ceramic bond within the clusters and synthetic resin bond between clusters and working layer matrix).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The hardness of the working layer is preferably at least 80 Shore A. More preferably, the working layer is of a multi-layer construction, with the top layer and the bottom layer having different hardnesses so that point elasticity and long-wave flexibility of the working layer can be adapted independently of one another to the procedural requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Before the first use of a working layer, the abrasive substances bound in the working layer are preferably exposed as a result of removing the uppermost layer in order to utilise the abrasive substances for the grinding procedure. This initial sharpening is carried out using, for example grindstones or blades which are preferably mounted on specifically modified runner wheels and are guided over the two working wheels by the roll-off device. The initial sharpening procedure is also called “dressing” in English.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Dressing is preferably carried out using grindstones containing an abrasive grain which has a similar grain size to the abrasive in the working layers. These “dressing stones” can be annular, for example and can be inserted into an externally toothed driving collar so that they can be guided along between the upper and lower working layers in a suitable manner by the roll-off devices of the grinding machine. When the dressing stones are dressed, they preferably cover the entire surface of the working layers and more preferably they even run slightly beyond the edge thereof, temporarily or constantly. The abrasive grain is preferably bound in the dressing stone such that the wear of the dressing stones still allows an economical dressing operation, but during the dressing process, at least one layer of loose dressing stone grain is always in the working zone between dressing stone surface and working layer surface, so that the dressing procedure is mainly performed by free (unbound) grain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">It has been found that the dressing process produces a disturbed, near-surface layer in the working layer, the depth of which has approximately the extent of the abrasive grain. Thus, a dressing stone with grain which is too coarse imprints a structure onto the working layer which is characterised by the grain of the dressing stone and not by the characteristics of the working layer. This is disadvantageous for the desired self-dressing, which is uniform as far as possible, of the working layer in the subsequent grinding operation. A dressing stone which is too fine removes too little material and results in an uneconomical dressing procedure. Finally, it has been found that dressing mainly by free abrasive grain exerts fewer directed forces onto the working layer due to the roll-off movement of the abrasive grain during the dressing movement than dressing with mainly fixed abrasive grain and a coarser but particularly isotropic, dressed working layer is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">A grain is preferably used for sharpening or dressing the working layer which is softer than the abrasive grain used in the working layer. Abrasive grain consisting of corundum (Al2O3) is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Abrasive substance residues which have become dull as a result of continual wear of the working layer are preferably removed and new, effectively cutting abrasive substances are constantly exposed. Consequently, a continuous operation is possible up until the working layers are completely worn out. This operational condition without an interim re-dressing intervention is called a “self-dressing operation” of the working layers and is particularly preferred. The engagement of the grains, exposed on the surface of the working layers, into the surface of the semiconductor wafers and the material removal effected by the relative movement between working layer and semiconductor wafers is technically termed “multi-grain grinding with a geometrically undetermined cutting edge”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">It is further preferred that the material is removed by a mainly extensive engagement by the working layer. The expression “extensive engagement” is understood as meaning that the part of the surface of the working layer which on average is actually in contact with the semiconductor layer during the grinding work is significantly larger than the contact surface of the grinding coating of a cup wheel during processing by a conventional cup wheel grinding process, for example DDG or SSG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">The runner wheels are preferably produced from a completely metal-free material, for example a ceramic material. However, runner wheels are also preferred which have a core of, for example steel or stainless steel and are covered by a non-metallic coating. A coating of this type preferably consists of thermoplasts or duroplasts, ceramics or organic-inorganic hybrid polymers, diamond (“diamond-like carbon”, DLC), or alternatively of a hard plating or a nickel-phosphorus coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">When the runner wheels are made of metal or they have a metal core, the walls of the recesses for receiving the semiconductor wafers are preferably lined with a ceramic material. Consequently, there is no direct contact between the semiconductor wafer and the metal of the runner wheel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The recesses for receiving the semiconductor wafers in the runner wheels are preferably made eccentrically with respect to the centre of the respective runner wheel such that the centre point of the runner wheel is outside the surface of the semiconductor wafers. One runner wheel preferably has three to eight recesses for semiconductor wafers. During a grinding procedure, there are preferably five to nine runner wheels at the same time in the grinding machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">The pressure by which the working layers are pressed against the semiconductor wafers during processing, and the path speed of the semiconductor wafers over the working layers are preferably selected during the main load step such that the total removal rate, i.e. the sum of the removal rates on both sides of the semiconductor wafers is from 2 to 60 μm/min. The term “main load step” is understood as meaning the processing phase within which the greatest proportion of total removal of the entire grinding treatment is produced, where in turn “processing phase” is understood as a period of time during which all the procedural parameters remain constant. The main load step is generally the processing phase with the highest pressure or with the proportionately longest duration, or both. In the case of a working layer with diamond grinding grains of an average size of 3 to 15 μm, a removal rate of between 2.5 and 25 μm/min is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">For the pressure exerted by the working wheels on the semiconductor wafers during the main load step, a range of from 0.007 to 0.5 bars is preferred and a range of from 0.012 to 0.3 bars is particularly preferred. For these values, the pressure is based on the total surface of the semiconductor wafers located in the device for processing and not on the effective contact surface between working layer and semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Furthermore, an opposite rotation of the working wheels relative to the average rotational speed of the runner wheels during the main load step of the processing is preferred. In addition, it is particularly preferred that the pressures, rotational speeds and thus path speeds assume different values for the different processing phases. Finally, it is also particularly preferred that in specific low pressure processing phases (“spark out” phases), the working wheels rotate in the same direction. A spark out phase of this type is expedient particularly right at the end of the entire grinding treatment and is therefore preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">During the processing, the temperature prevailing in the working gap formed between the working layers is preferably kept constant. For this purpose, the runner wheels can have openings through which cooling lubricant can be exchanged between the lower and upper working wheels, so that the upper and lower working layers are always at the same temperature. This counteracts an undesirable deformation of the working gap formed between the working layers by deformation of the working layers or working wheels due to thermal expansion with a changing load. Furthermore, the cooling of the abrasives bound into the working layers is improved and becomes more uniform and, as a result, the effective service life thereof is prolonged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The cooling lubricant which is used preferably consists of a water-based mixture with viscosity-modifying additives, such as glycols, short- or longer-chain polyethylene glycols, alcohols, sols or gels and similar substances which are known as coolants or lubricants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">However, a particularly preferred cooling lubricant is also pure water without any additives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The quantities of cooling lubricant supplied to the working gap via the leadthrough in the upper working wheel are preferably within a range of between 0.2 and 50 l/min and more preferably between 0.5 and 20 l/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The preferred starting thickness before the processing with step a) of the method according to the invention is from 500 to 1000 μm.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The final thickness of the semiconductor wafers after processing according to step a) of the method according to the invention is preferably from 500 to 950 μm and more preferably from 775 to 870 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The total removal, i.e. the sum of the individual removals from both sides of the semiconductor wafer is preferably from 7.5 to 120 μm and more preferably from 15 to 90 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The shape of the working gap formed between the working layers is preferably determined during the grinding procedure and the shape of the working surface of at least one working wheel is changed mechanically or thermally subject to the measured shape of the working gap such that the working gap has a predetermined shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">During processing, the semiconductor wafers preferably temporarily leave the working gap, defined by the working layers, with a part of their surface, the maximum of the overrun in a radial direction amounting to more than 0% and at most 20% of the diameter of the semiconductor wafer, the overrun being defined as the length measured in a radial direction based on the working wheels, by which length the one semiconductor wafer projects beyond the inner edge or outer edge of the working gap at a specific time during the grinding procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">Step (b)—Rounding Off the Edge of the Semiconductor Wafer:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In step (b), the semiconductor wafer is provided with a rounded edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">For this purpose, the semiconductor wafer is fixed on a rotating table and is advanced with its edge against the also rotating working surface of a machining tool. The machining tools used in this respect can be configured as discs which are attached to a spindle and have peripheral surfaces which are used as working surfaces for processing the edge of the semiconductor wafer. The material-removing grain can be firmly anchored in the working surfaces of the machining tools. For the most part, the grain used has a coarse grain size. The average grain size is preferably greater than or equal to 10 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">These grinding machining tools are suited to providing the semiconductor wafer with rounded edges. However, after the edge rounding step, a particular minimum roughness usually remains on the edge surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">In a later processing step, the ground edge, also treated with an etching medium, of the wafer is thus polished in step (g).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">If PPG is used in step (a) of the method, it is preferred to carry out two edge grinding steps, in which case the first edge rounding step takes place before the PPG step.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">In step (c) of the method, both sides of the semiconductor wafer are ground.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">The front and back are preferably ground sequentially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">For this purpose, the semiconductor wafer, held on a wafer holder, and an opposite grinding wheel are rotated independently of one another, the grinding wheel being in a laterally offset arrangement relative to the semiconductor wafer and being positioned such that an axial centre of the semiconductor wafer passes into a working region of the grinding wheel, the grinding wheel being moved at an advance speed in the direction of the semiconductor wafer, as a result of which the grinding wheel and semiconductor wafer are advanced towards one another while the semiconductor wafer and grinding wheel rotate about parallel axes so that a surface of the semiconductor wafer is ground and, after a specific material removal has been achieved, the grinding wheel is guided back at a return speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">It is preferred for the grinding wheel and the semiconductor wafer to be advanced by a path of 0.03 to 0.5 μm during a rotation of the semiconductor wafer. The choice of advance during a rotation of the semiconductor wafer of 0.03 to 0.1 μm is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">A grinding wheel which has a grain size of greater than or equal to # 2000 is preferably used, a grain size of # 2000 to # 8000 being most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The grain size is usually given in # (“mesh”) according to Japanese Industrial Standard JIS R 6001:1998.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">An average particle size can be calculated from the mesh numbers:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">The use of grinding wheels with a fine granulation is often referred to as fine grinding. Fine grinding wheels of this type have a granulation of, for example, # 1000 to # 4000 and are commercially available from Disco Corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In the conversion into particle sizes, it is found that, for example # 1200 corresponds to an average particle size of 9.5 μm, # 5000 corresponds to an average particle size of 2.5 μm and # 8000 corresponds to an average particle size of 1.2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Thus, the average particle sizes in fine grinding are slightly greater than or equal to 1 μm or are less than or equal to 10 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">A sequence of two series-connected grinding steps is particularly preferred, where the first step is carried out using grinding wheels of a granulation of less than or equal to # 2000 in order to achieve the highest possible removal rates and short processing times (coarse grinding) and the second subsequent step is carried out using grinding wheels of a granulation of greater than # 2000 and less than or equal to # 8000 to obtain particularly smoothly ground wafers with a minimal damage of approximately 1 μm (fine grinding).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">The total removal by the fine grinding step is preferably 25 μm, with a symmetrical removal of approximately 12.5 μm per side.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">The advance speed is preferably 10 to 20 μm/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">Step (d)—FAP Polishing of at Least One Side of the Semiconductor Wafer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">In step (d), at least one side of the semiconductor wafer is polished with a polishing cloth containing abrasives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">In step (d), only the front of the semiconductor wafer is preferably polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">In step (d), only the back of the semiconductor wafer is preferably polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">In step (d), the front and the back of the semiconductor wafer are preferably polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">During the polishing step, a polish solution which is free from solids is preferably introduced between the side, to be polished, of the semiconductor wafer and the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">In the simplest case, the polish solution is water, preferably deionised water (DIW) with the purity conventionally used in the semiconductor industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">However, the polish solution can also contain compounds such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or any mixtures thereof. The use of potassium carbonate is most particularly preferred. In this case, the pH value of the polish solution is preferably within a range of from 10 to 12 and the content of the mentioned compounds in the polish solution is preferably from 0.01 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.2% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Furthermore, the polish solution can contain one or more further additives, for example surface-active additives such as wetting agents and surfactants, stabilisers acting as protective colloids, preservatives, biocides, alcohols and complex formers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">A polishing cloth is used which contains an abrasive substance bound in the polishing cloth (FAP or FA cloth or FA pad).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Suitable abrasive substances include, for example, particles of oxides of the elements cerium, aluminium, silicon, zirconium and particles of hard substances, such as silicon carbide, boron nitride and diamond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">Polishing cloths which are particularly suitable have a surface topography which is characterised by replicated microstructures. These microstructures (“posts”) have, for example, the shape of columns with a cylindrical or polygonal cross section or the shape of pyramids or truncated pyramids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">More detailed descriptions of this type of polishing cloth are provided, for example, in WO 92/13680 A1 and US 2005/227590 A1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">The use of a polishing cloth which has firmly bound abrasives of cerium oxide is most particularly preferred, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,117 B1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">The grain sizes of the FAP polishing cloths which are used (size of the firmly bound abrasives/particles) are preferably greater than or equal to 0.1 μm and are less than or equal to 1.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">A particle size of from 0.1 to 0.6 μm is particularly preferred.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">For the FA polishing, the procedure is preferably carried out with removed amounts of greater than or equal to 1 μm per side and, in this respect, the range of 1 to 3 μm is particularly preferred and a range of 1.5 to 2 μm is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">The wafers processed by the FA polishing have preferably been previously worked on both sides by grinding wheels having a granulation of # 2000 to # 8000 (fine grinding).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">Step (e)—Etching or Cleaning the Semiconductor Wafer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">In step (e) of the method according to the invention, both sides of the semiconductor wafer are treated with an etching medium with a material removal of not more than 1 μm per side of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">The minimum material removal per side of the semiconductor wafer is preferably one monolayer, i.e. approximately 0.1 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">The semiconductor wafer preferably undergoes a wet-chemical treatment using an acidic medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Suitable acidic media are aqueous solutions of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid or acetic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">It is most particularly preferred to treat the semiconductor wafer with a gaseous medium containing hydrogen fluoride and at least one oxidant which oxidises the surface of the semiconductor wafer. In this case, it is particularly advantageous for the gaseous medium to flow onto the surfaces of the semiconductor wafer at a relative speed within a range of from 40 mm/s to 300 m/s.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">Thus, the gaseous medium contains hydrogen fluoride and at least one oxidant. The oxidant should be capable of oxidising the semiconductor material, for example silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">The oxidation of a silicon surface produces, for example a silicon oxide, preferably silicon dioxide. In turn, this is chemically attacked by hydrogen fluoride, thereby producing as reaction products hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6), silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) and water which are removed by the flow of the gaseous medium. The gaseous medium can also contain further constituents, for example inert carrier gases such as nitrogen or argon, to influence the flow conditions and removal rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">At least one oxidant is preferably used which is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen dioxide, ozone and chlorine. The use of pure chlorine necessitates the addition of water vapour to oxidise the silicon surface. In the use of a mixture of nitrogen dioxide and chlorine as well as ozone and chlorine, the addition of chlorine serves the purpose of using the water, released in the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with silicon dioxide, for the further oxidation of the silicon surface, and thus of preventing a condensation of the water, released in the reaction, even at low flow velocities and temperatures. It is particularly preferred to use ozone due to its high oxidation potential, the unproblematic reaction products and the simple preparation by ozone generators widely used in the semiconductor industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">To prepare the gaseous medium, the constituents can be mixed in the desired quantity ratios. The ratio of hydrogen fluoride to oxidant is typically selected within a range of from 1:1 to 4:1. The gaseous medium can either be supplied by the direct feed of the individual components into the processing chamber or can be delivered into a mixer connected upstream, or by passing the gaseous oxidant through a liquid aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride of a suitable concentration. This can take place, for example in a so-called wash bottle or in a comparable device. When the gaseous oxidant passes through the aqueous solution, said oxidant is enriched with water and hydrogen fluoride, thereby producing the required gaseous medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">With the same procedural parameters and with a constant ratio of hydrogen fluoride to oxidant, an increase in temperature and an increase in the concentration exhibit a reaction-accelerating effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">The etching procedure in the gas phase serves to reduce the roughness of the semiconductor wafer, which means that the polishing removal can be reduced, and also serves to remove impurities and to reduce superficial defects in the crystal structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The cleaning and etching processes which have been described are preferably carried out as a single wafer treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">SSEC 3400 ML manufactured by Solid State Equipment Corp./USA which is configured for substrates up to a size of 500 mm×500 mm is specifically suited to a semiconductor wafer which is particularly preferred in the context of the method according to the invention and has a diameter of 450 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">Step (g)—Polishing the Edge of the Semiconductor Wafer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">In step (g), the edge of the semiconductor wafer is polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">Commercially available automatic edge-polishing machines are suitable for carrying out step (g) of the method according to the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,105 discloses a device of this type for edge polishing, in which the polishing drum consists of an aluminium alloy and is covered by a polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">The semiconductor wafer is usually fixed on a planar wafer holder, a so-called chuck. The edge of the semiconductor wafer projects over the chuck so that it is freely accessible to the polishing drum. A centrally rotating polishing drum which is inclined at a specific angle towards the chuck and is covered by a polishing cloth and the chuck with the semiconductor wafer are advanced towards one another and are pressed against one another under a specific contact pressure while the polish is supplied continuously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">For the edge polishing procedure, the chuck is rotated centrally with the semiconductor wafer held thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">One rotation of the chuck preferably lasts from 20 to 300 s, more preferably from 50 to 150 s (rotation time).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">A polishing drum which is covered by the polishing cloth and which is preferably rotated centrally at a speed of from 300 to 1500 min-1, more preferably from 500 to 1000 min-1 and the chuck are advanced towards one another, the polishing drum being positioned obliquely against the semiconductor wafer at a set angle and the semiconductor wafer being fixed on the chuck such that it projects slightly over the chuck and is thus accessible to the polishing drum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">The set angle is preferably from 30 to 50°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">The semiconductor wafer and the polishing drum are pressed against one another with a specific contact pressure while a polish is supplied continuously, preferably with a polish flow of 0.1 to 1 litre/min, more preferably 0.15 to 0.40 litre/min, it being possible for the contact pressure to be set by weights attached to rollers and said contact pressure preferably being 1 to 5 kg, more preferably 2 to 4 kg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">After 2 to 20, more preferably after 2 to 8 rotations of the semiconductor wafer or of the chuck holding the semiconductor wafer, the polishing drum and semiconductor wafer are preferably moved away from one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">In these conventional edge polishing methods, the local shape in the peripheral region of the semiconductor wafer is for the most part adversely affected. This is linked to the fact that with the relatively “soft edge polishing cloths” used in this respect (relatively soft polishing cloths charged with silica sol are usually used), not only the edge itself, but also an outer part of the front and/or back of the semiconductor wafer is polished, which can be explained by “immersion” of the hard edge into the polishing cloth charged with polish suspension. Consequently, not only is material removed in the region of the actual edge, but also in the adjoining region on the front and/or back.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">For this reason, the edge polishing procedure of the semiconductor wafer is preferably carried out in the method according to the invention by fixing the semiconductor wafer on a centrally rotating chuck, advancing the semiconductor wafer and a centrally rotating polishing drum which is inclined towards the chuck and covered by a polishing cloth containing firmly bound abrasives (FAP polishing cloth) and pressing the semiconductor wafer and the polishing drum against one another with the continuous supply of a polish solution which does not contain any solids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">By this edge polishing method, it is possible to influence the edge of the wafer in a targeted manner, without impairing the adjoining region of front and/or back of the semiconductor wafer and thus, for example to set the desired geometrical and surface characteristics only on the edge of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">The FAP cloth which is used is substantially harder and far less compressible than the polishing cloths used as standard and it also affords the advantage of producing the removal without alkaline-charged silica sol, for example only by using an alkaline solution, which also prevents the spread of polish onto the front of the wafer and thus prevents the additional adverse affect on the surface of the wafer, in the form of, for example increased defect rates such as LLS (localised light scatterers) due to etchings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">In addition to this, a short soft polishing step using gently removing silica sol can be subsequently carried out on the same FAP polishing cloth to reduce the edge roughness and the defect rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">The two polishing steps can then be coordinated with one another, so that the wafer edge shape and surface can be influenced in a positive and targeted manner, without an adverse effect on the partial sites on the front and back of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">Thus, in principle the semiconductor wafer is preferably polished by means of a polishing drum, on the surface of which a hard and difficultly compressible polishing cloth is affixed which contains firmly bound adhesives, with the supply of an alkaline solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Thereafter, in a second step, a smoothing step is preferably carried out on the same polishing cloth, with the supply of a silica sol, for example Glanzox 3900* with approximately 1% by weight of SiO2. * Glanzox 3900 is the product name of a polish suspension supplied as a concentrate by Fujimi Incorporated, Japan. The base solution of this concentrate has a pH of 10.5 and contains approximately 9% by weight of colloidal SiO2 with an average particle size of 30 to 40 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">It has been found that an edge polishing step of this type using an FAP cloth completely avoids the impairment, observed in the prior art, in the local shape in the peripheral region of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">A further advantage is that the spread of polish in the removing step of the edge polishing procedure and thus the appearance of surface defects due to uncontrolled etchings on the wafer surface are prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">The polish solution used in the edge polishing procedure is, in the simplest case, water, preferably deionised water (DIW) with the purity conventionally used in the semiconductor industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">However, the polish solution can also contain compounds such as sodium carbonate (NaCO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or any mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">The use of potassium carbonate is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">The pH value of the polish solution is preferably within a range of from 10 to 12 and the content of the mentioned compounds in the polish solution is preferably from 0.01 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.2% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">Furthermore, the polish solution can contain one or more further additives, for example surface-active additives such as wetting agents and surfactants, stabilisers acting as protective colloids, preservatives, biocides, alcohols and complex formers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">In the preferred second step of the edge polishing procedure, a polish containing abrasives is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">The content of abrasive substance in the polish suspension is preferably 0.25 to 20% by weight, more preferably 0.25 to 1% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">The size distribution of the abrasive particles preferably has a monomodal occurrence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">The average particle size is from 5 to 300 nm, more preferably from 5 to 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">The abrasive substance consists of a material which mechanically removes the substrate material, and preferably consists of one or more of the oxides of the elements aluminium, cerium or silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">A polish suspension is particularly preferred which contains colloid-disperse silicic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">In the optional second step of the edge polishing procedure, in contrast to the first step, preferably no additives such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) are added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">However, the polish suspension can contain one or more further additives, for example surface-active additives such as wetting agents and surfactants, stabilisers acting as protective colloids, preservatives, biocides, alcohols and complex formers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">Thus in step (g) of the method according to the invention, a polishing cloth is preferably used which contains an abrasive substance bound in the polishing cloth (FAP cloth or FA pad).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">Suitable abrasive substances include, for example, particles of oxides of the elements cerium, aluminium, silicon, zirconium and particles of hard substances, such as silicon carbide, boron nitride and diamond.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">The flexible layer preferably corresponds to the lowest layer of the polishing cloth. Positioned over the flexible layer is preferably a foam layer, for example of polyurethane which is attached to the flexible layer by an adhesive layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">The different layers are preferably attached to one another by pressure-sensitive adhesive layers (PSA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">The inventor has found that a polishing cloth without the PU foam layer which is always present in prior art FAP polishing cloths produces good results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">In this case, the polishing cloth comprises a layer with the micro-replicates, a flexible layer and a layer consisting of a rigid plastics material such as polycarbonate, where the flexible layer can either be the middle or the bottom layer of the polishing cloth.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0012">Steps (f) and (h)—Bilateral Polishing by FAP and CMP</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">Furthermore, in step (f), the front of the semiconductor wafer is polished using a polishing cloth with firmly bound abrasives and the back of the semiconductor wafer is polished at the same time using a polishing cloth which does not contain any abrasives, but a polishing cloth containing abrasives is introduced between the polishing cloth and the back of the semiconductor wafer.</div>

The conventional DSP step and the subsequent separate CMP step are not required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Steps (f) and (h) can be carried out on existing installations for the double-side polishing of semiconductor wafers, for example on a commercially available double-side polishing machine of type AC2000 manufactured by Peter Wolters, Rendsburg (Germany).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">This polishing machine is fitted with a pin toothing of the outer and inner rings to drive the runner wheels. The installation can be configured for one or more runner wheels. On account of the high throughput, an installation is preferred for a plurality of runner wheels, as described for example in DE-100 07 390 A1 and in which the runner wheels move on a planetary path around the centre of the installation. A lower and an upper polishing disc are part of the installation and are freely horizontally rotatable and are covered by a polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">During the polishing process, the semiconductor wafers are located in the recesses in the runner wheels and between the two polishing discs which rotate and exert a specific polishing pressure on the wafers, while a polish is supplied continuously. In this respect, the runner wheels are also set into rotation, preferably by rotating pin rings which engage into teeth on the periphery of the runner wheels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">A typical runner wheel comprises recesses for receiving three semiconductor wafers. Located on the periphery of the recesses are inserts which are to protect the edges of the semiconductor wafers which are susceptible to breaking, in particular to also protect against a release of metals from the body of the runner wheels. The runner wheel body can consist of, for example metal, ceramics, plastics material, fibre-reinforced plastics material or metal coated with plastics material or with a diamond-like carbon layer (“diamond-like carbon”, DLC layer). However, steels are preferred, more preferably chromium stainless steel. The recesses are preferably configured to receive an uneven number of semiconductor wafers with a diameter of at least 200 mm, preferably 300 mm, most particularly preferably 450 mm and thicknesses of 500 to 1000 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">The polish used for polishing with a polishing cloth which does not contain any firmly bound abrasives, contains abrasives. This polish is a polish suspension.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">The size distribution of the abrasive particles preferably has a monomodal occurrence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">The average particle size is from 5 to 300 nm, more preferably from 5 to 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The abrasive substance consists of a material which mechanically removes the substrate material, and preferably consists of one or more of the oxides of the elements aluminium, cerium or silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">The content of abrasive substance in the polish suspension is preferably 0.25 to 20% by weight, more preferably 0.25 to 1% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">The use of colloid-disperse silicic acid as the polish suspension is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">The aqueous polishes Levasil® 200 produced by Bayer AG and Glanzox 3900® produced by Fujimi, are used for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">The polish preferably contains additives such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">However, the polish suspension can contain one or more further additives, for example surface-active additives such as wetting agents and surfactants, stabilisers acting as protective colloids, preservatives, biocides, alcohols and complex formers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">In the method according to the invention, according to steps (f) and (h), a polishing cloth is also used which contains an abrasive substance bound in the polishing cloth (FAP or FA cloth or FA pad).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">Suitable abrasive substances include, for example, particles of oxides of the elements cerium, aluminium, silicon, zirconium and particles of hard substances, such as silicon carbide, boron nitride and diamond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">Polishing cloths which are particularly suitable have a surface topography which is characterised by replicated microstructures. These microstructures (“posts”) have, for example, the shape of columns with a cylindrical or polygonal cross section or the shape of pyramids or truncated pyramids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">More detailed descriptions of this type of polishing cloth are provided, for example, in WO 92/13680 A1 and US 2005/227590 A1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">The use of a polishing cloth with firmly bound-in abrasives of cerium oxide, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,117 B1 is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">The grain sizes of the FAP polishing cloths used (size of the firmly bound abrasives/particles) are preferably greater than or equal to 0.1 μm and less than or equal to 1.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">A particle size of 0.1 to 0.6 μm is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">A particle size of 0.1 to 0.25 μm is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">One polishing disc is fitted with an FAP cloth of this type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">The second polishing disc is covered by a conventional CMP polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">The CMP polishing cloths used are polishing cloths which have a porous matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">The polishing cloth preferably consists of a thermoplastic or heat-hardenable polymer. A large number of materials are considered, for example polyurethanes, polycarbonate, polyamide, polyacrylate, polyester, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">The polishing cloth preferably contains solid, micro-porous polyurethane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">The use of polishing cloths consisting of foamed sheets or felt or fibre substrates impregnated with polymers is also preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">Coated/impregnated polishing cloths can also be configured such that they have a different pore distribution and different pore sizes in the substrate than in the coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">The polishing cloths can be substantially planar or they can also be perforated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">To control the porosity of the polishing cloth, fillers can be introduced into the cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">Commercially available polishing cloths are for example SPM 3100 by Rodel Inc. or the cloths of the DCP series as well as the cloths of trademarks IC1000™, Polytex™ or SUBA™ by Rohm &amp; Hass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">As previously mentioned, when carrying out a polishing procedure according to steps (f) and (h) of the method according to the invention on a double-side polishing machine, as is the case, for example with type AC 2000 manufactured by Peter Wolfers/Rendsberg, the unilateral haze-free polishing (CMP) which is obligatory in the prior art can be omitted, since the polishing which determines the shape and the polishing which determines the surface quality can be carried out fully on one type of machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">However, in the prior art, the removal polishing and haze-free polishing (DSP and CMP) were carried out separately from one another and on different polishing machines. Only the front of the semiconductor wafer was polished by CMP in the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">To achieve an optimum wafer shape, here in particular the peripheral shape (edge roll-off elimination), a simultaneous double-side polishing with planetary kinematics and a combined use of fixed abrasive and CMP polishing cloths affords advantages, because the fixed abrasive polishing process makes it possible, due to the hard cloth which can optionally be configured with an overrun, to dispense with a silica sol-containing component to achieve the desired polishing removal and it also makes it possible to influence, in a targeted manner, the peripheral region of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">In addition, the CMP polishing is already integrated in the framework of the simultaneous bilateral polishing, in that one of the polishing discs is fitted with a CMP polishing cloth on which the CMP step is carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">The double-side polishing procedure according to the invention takes place in two sub-polishing steps (f) and (h), between which the edge of the semiconductor wafer is polished according to step (g).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">A two-stage edge polishing procedure is preferably carried out in which a first edge polishing procedure takes place between the two sub-steps of the double-side polishing procedure (f) and (h) and the second edge polishing procedure takes place at the end of the entire double-side polishing process, i.e. after step (h), which makes it possible to adjust more finely the edge polishing procedure by this division into two steps and thus to affect as little as possible the peripheral shape of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">Both steps of the edge polishing procedure are preferably carried out using polishing cloths with abrasives bound firmly therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">The second edge polishing procedure is preferably carried out with the supply of a polish suspension which contains abrasives, like the optional soft polishing step described under (g).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">The content of abrasive substances in the polish suspension is preferably 0.25 to 20% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">The abrasive substances in the polish suspension are preferably selected from one or more of the group consisting of oxides of the elements aluminium, cerium or silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">The polish suspension is preferably colloid-disperse silicic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">The pH value of the polish suspension is preferably 9 to 11.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">The pH value of the polish suspension is preferably adjusted by the addition of additives, selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or any mixtures of these compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">To achieve a specifically desired defined roughness of the polished back of the wafer, it can be advantageous to carry out additional unilateral FAP polishing procedures on the back:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">This preferably takes place in three steps, in each case using a polishing cloth which contains an abrasive substance bound in the polishing cloth and is pressed with a polishing pressure onto the back of the semiconductor wafer and, in the first step, a polish which is free from solids, but in the second and third steps a polish which contains abrasive substances is introduced between the polishing cloth and the back of the semiconductor wafer, a polishing pressure in the first and second steps of 8 to 15 psi being reduced in the third step to 0.5 to 5 psi.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">The semiconductor wafer preferably has on the planar surface of its back an average surface roughness Ra within a broad range of from 0.3 to 4.5 nm, based on local wavelengths of less than or equal to 250 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240">Suitable for determining the surface roughness is for example a Chapman Surface Profiler MP 2000 with a 250 μm filter (spatial wavelengths greater than 250 μm=waviness data, cf. Chapman Technical Note-TG-1, Rev-01-09).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0241">If a high back roughness is desired within the above-mentioned range, FAP cloths with grain sizes of from 0.5 to 1.0 μm are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">If a low back roughness is desired, FAP cloths with grain sizes of from 0.1 to 0.25 μm are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0243">The polish solution in the first step of the polishing procedure of the back of the silicon wafer of the method according to the invention is, in the simplest case, water, preferably deionised water (DIW) with the purity conventionally used in the semiconductor industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0244">However, the polish solution can also contain compounds such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or any mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0245">The use of potassium carbonate is most particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0246">In the second step of the polishing procedure of the back of the semiconductor wafer, a polish containing abrasives is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0247">The abrasive substance consists of a material which mechanically removes the substrate material, and preferably consists of one or more of the oxides of the elements aluminium, cerium or silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0248">A polish suspension is particularly preferred which contains colloid-disperse silicic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0249">In the third step of the polishing procedure of the back of the semiconductor wafer, a polish containing abrasives is also used, as in the second step. The polishing pressure is reduced from 8 to 15 psi to 0.5 to 5 psi, compared to the first and second steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0250">Conventional polishing machines, such as the “nHance 6EG” polishing machine manufactured by Strasbaugh Inc. are suitable for performing these polishing procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">The polishing machine by Strasbaugh Inc. has a polishing disc with a polishing cloth and a polishing head which processes a semiconductor wafer in a fully automatic manner. The polishing head is mounted cardanically and comprises a fixed base plate coated with a “backing pad”, and a movable guide ring. Air cushions can be built up through holes in the base plate, in two concentric pressure zones, an inner pressure zone and an outer pressure zone, the semiconductor wafer floating on said air cushions during the polishing procedure. The movable guide ring can be pressurised by a compressed air bellows to thus pre-tension the polishing cloth during contact with the semiconductor wafer and to keep it flat.</div>
