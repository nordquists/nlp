<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a method for etching the front surface of a wafer one by one, where the wafer is rotated while an etching solution is supplied onto the front surface of the wafer.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">In general, the process for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer comprises the steps of obtaining wafers by cutting and slicing out of a single crystal ingot, and chamfering the respective wafers, mechanical grinding (lapping), etching, mirror-polishing, and cleaning, thereby producing a wafer with highly precise flatness. The wafer, which has been subjected to the steps for mechanical processing, such as block-cutting, rounding, slicing, and lapping, has a damaged layer (i.e., a processing-strained layer) on the surface thereof. In the process for device production, such a processing-strained layer causes crystal defects, such as slip dislocation, and the mechanical strength of the wafer is then decreased. In addition, it has adverse effects on electric characteristics. Therefore, the processing-strained layer should be completely removed. For removing such a processing-strained layer, an etching process is carried out. There are two types of etching: dip-etching and single wafer etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Among the etching processes, the single wafer etching has been regarded as the most suitable etching process, which enables the control of the texture-size and surface roughness of a large-sized wafer. The single wafer etching is a process comprising dropping an etching solution onto the front surface of a flattened single wafer and horizontally rotating (spinning) the wafer to spread out the dripped etching solution over the front surface of the wafer. The etching solution supplied on the wafer is spread out over the surface of the wafer from a supplied point by centrifugal force caused by horizontally spinning the wafer, and finally reaches the edge of the wafer, so that the edge of the wafer as well as the front surface thereof can be also etched at the same time. Furthermore, most of the etching solution supplied is blown off from the edge thereof by centrifugal force and then collected into a cup or the like arranged on an etching device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">For example, as a process for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer that can effectively remove a processing-strained layer caused by mechanical grinding and retain the flatness of the wafer, there is disclosed one including the following steps; slicing a silicon single crystal ingot; chamfering the end face of the sliced wafer; flattening at least the front surface thereof obtained by slicing the semiconductor ingot by means of surface grinding or lapping; spin-etching the flattened front surface of the wafer; and polishing the etched front surface of the wafer into a mirror surface (e.g., see Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Patent Document 1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-135464 (claim 1, FIG. 1)</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">However, in the single wafer etching shown in the Patent Document 1, the etching solution is quantitatively dripped through a single supply nozzle, so that etching amount may vary. As a result, the front and back surfaces of a silicon wafer, subjected to the etching process, have deficiencies that the flatness of the wafer cannot be maintained after the flattening process including lapping and grinding. In addition, the desired surface roughness of the wafer cannot be obtained. Therefore, for improving the flatness and surface roughness thereof, a large amount of grinding margin is required in the mirror polishing process, so that the subsequent steps in mirror polishing will bear a heavy burden.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a method for etching a single wafer, which can effectively attain high flatness and improve the productivity thereof.</div>
<heading>Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the invention of claim <b>1</b> is an improvement of a method for etching a single wafer, wherein a single thin disk-like silicon wafer <b>11</b> sliced from a silicon single crystal ingot is spun to etch a front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> with etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> supplied thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The characteristic feature thereof lies in that a plurality of etching solution supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed above and opposite to the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> at different portions in the radial direction of the wafer, respectively and one or more conditions selected from the group consisting of temperatures, kinds, and supply flow rates of etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> from the plurality of supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are then changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In the single wafer etching apparatus as described in claim <b>1</b>, plural etching solution supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed above and opposite to the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> at different portions in the radial direction of the wafer, respectively.

Typically, in the method for etching a single wafer, due to both the generation of heat by reaction and the transfer of a liquid in the peripheral direction of the wafer by centrifugal force, excessive etching may tend to occur in the periphery.

<heading>BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments for carrying out the present invention will be described in more details with reference to the attached drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon single wafer etching apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a wafer chuck <b>12</b> housed in a chamber, on which a thin disk-like silicon wafer <b>11</b> is mounted and retained horizontally. The wafer chuck <b>12</b> comprises a disk-like base member <b>13</b> having a diameter larger than that of the wafer <b>11</b> and a holding axis <b>16</b> in which an axial part <b>16</b> <i>a </i>is inserted through a through hole <b>13</b> <i>a </i>formed in the center of the base member <b>13</b> and extended in the vertical direction. The holding axis <b>16</b> comprises the axial part <b>16</b> <i>a</i>; a wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b </i>having a large diameter, which is integrally formed with the axial part <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and arranged on the front surface of the axial part <b>16</b> <i>a</i>; a through hole <b>16</b> <i>c</i>, which is formed in the center of the holding axis <b>16</b> and extends from the bottom face to the top of the holding axis <b>16</b> in the vertical direction; a plurality of communicating holes <b>16</b> <i>d </i>each having an end communicating with the upper end of the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c </i>and an opposite closed end, where the communicating holes <b>16</b> <i>d </i>radiate outward around the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c </i>in the radial direction of the wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b</i>; a plurality of ring grooves <b>16</b> <i>e </i>concentrically formed in the front surface of the wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b</i>; and a plurality of small pores <b>16</b> <i>f </i>allowing the communicating holes <b>16</b> <i>d </i>and the ring grooves <b>16</b> <i>e </i>to communicate with each other. A vacuum pump (not shown) is connected and communicated with the bottom end of the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c</i>. The front surface of the wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b </i>is configured to mount the wafer <b>11</b> concentrically with the wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b</i>. Then, when the vacuum pump is driven to make the inner pressure of the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c </i>negative, the negative pressure in the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c </i>allows the rear surface of the wafer <b>11</b> to be adsorbed onto the wafer-receiving part <b>16</b> <i>b </i>to retain the wafer <b>11</b> horizontally. In addition, the silicon single wafer etching apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a spinning device <b>17</b> for spinning the wafer <b>11</b> around the vertical axis thereof in a horizontal plane. The spinning device <b>17</b> comprises the holding axis <b>16</b>, a driving motor (not shown) for rotating the holding axis <b>16</b>. It is configured that the driving motor rotates the holding axis <b>16</b> to allow the wafer <b>11</b> retained on the holding axis <b>16</b> to be spun with the holding axis <b>16</b>. Alternatively, it may be configured that when the driving motor rotates the holding axis, the wafer is spun with the holding axis while the base member is being fixed without spinning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed above and opposite to the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> at different positions in the radial direction of the wafer <b>11</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the plurality of the supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> include a first supply nozzle <b>31</b> that supplies a first etching solution <b>21</b> to the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> and a second supply nozzle <b>32</b> that supplies a second etching solution <b>22</b> to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>. These supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> can be independently moved, respectively by nozzle-moving devices <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> disposed separately. The first nozzle-moving device <b>41</b> for moving the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> comprises: a rotary motor <b>41</b> <i>a </i>that directly moves the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> in the axial direction; a ball screw <b>41</b> <i>c </i>coaxially connected to a rotary axis <b>41</b> <i>b </i>of the rotary motor <b>41</b> <i>a</i>; and a female screw member <b>41</b> <i>d </i>for holding the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> in which a female screw that can be screwed by the ball screw <b>41</b> <i>c </i>is formed. By allowing the ball screw <b>41</b> <i>c </i>to rotate by rotating the rotational axis <b>41</b> <i>b </i>of the rotary motor <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> can be directly moved in the axial direction thereof together with the female screw member <b>41</b> <i>d</i>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in detail, the first supply nozzle is configured that it can oscillate between a first evacuation position (i.e., a position represented by a two-dot chain line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) where a first discharge opening <b>31</b> <i>a </i>does not face to the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> and a first liquid supplying position (i.e., a position represented by a solid line) where the first discharge opening <b>31</b> <i>a </i>faces to the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, due to the first nozzle-moving device <b>41</b>. On the other hand, the second nozzle-moving device <b>42</b> that moves the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> is mounted on the base end of the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> and is provided with a stepping motor <b>42</b> <i>a </i>that allows the tip of the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> to oscillate around the base end. Furthermore, the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> is configured that it can oscillate between a second evacuation position (i.e., a position represented by a two-dot chain line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) where the second discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>does not face to the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> and a second liquid supplying position (i.e., a position represented by a solid line) where the second discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>faces to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, due to the second nozzle-moving device <b>42</b>. Here, the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, where the second discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>is positioned on the second liquid supplying position, is a given distance within the range of (0.8 to 1.0)D/2 from the center of the wafer <b>11</b> to the edge thereof, when the outer diameter of the wafer <b>11</b> is D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> is connected to an etching solution supplying device <b>51</b> that discharges the first etching solution <b>21</b> from the first discharge opening <b>31</b> <i>a </i>to the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>. In contrast, the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> is connected to a second etching solution supplying device <b>52</b> that discharges the second etching solution <b>22</b> from the second discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>to the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>. The first etching solution supplying device <b>51</b> comprises a first tank <b>51</b> <i>a </i>for reserving the first etching solution <b>21</b>, a first conduit line <b>51</b> <i>b </i>that allows the first tank <b>51</b> <i>a </i>to connect to and communicate with the base end of the first supply nozzle <b>31</b>, a first pump <b>51</b> <i>c </i>for supplying the first etching solution <b>21</b> from the first tank <b>51</b> <i>a </i>mounted on the first conduit line <b>51</b> <i>b </i>to the first supply nozzle <b>31</b>, and a first flow control valve <b>51</b> <i>d </i>for adjusting the supply flow rate of the first etching solution <b>21</b> to the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> mounted on the first conduit line <b>51</b> <i>b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">One or more selected from the groups consisting of temperature, kind, and supply flow rate of each of the first and second etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> can be changed. When the temperatures of the first and second etching solution <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are changed, the first etching solution <b>21</b> is adjusted to a predetermined temperature of preferably in the range of 15 to 40° C., more preferably in the range of 15 to 30° C. by the first temperature controller and the second etching solution <b>22</b> is adjusted to a predetermined temperature lower than that of the first etching solution <b>21</b>, preferably in the range of 0 to 30° C., more preferably in the range of 5 to 20° C. Here, the reason of why the temperature of the first etching solution <b>21</b> is limited in the range of 15 to 40° C. is that less than 15° C. leads to a decrease in productivity as the etching rate of a main part of the wafer surface lowers and more than 40° C. leads to difficulty in maintenance of the degree of wafer flatness as the viscosity of the etching solution decreases. The reason of why the temperature of the etching solution <b>22</b> is limited in the range of 0 to 30° C. is that less than 0° C. leads to coagulation of the etching solution and more than 30° C. leads to insufficient effects because of a decrease in difference of the etching rates with the first etching solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Furthermore, when each of the kinds of the first and second etching solution <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> is changed, the first etching solution <b>21</b> used is one preferably having an etching rate of 0.2 to 3 μm/sec, more preferably 0.3 to 1 μm/sec at 30° C. and the second etching solution <b>22</b> used is one having an etching rate smaller than the first etching solution, preferably 0.01 to 1 μm/sec, more preferably 0.01 to 0.3 μm/sec. Here, the reason of why the etching rate of the first etching solution <b>21</b> is limited in the range of 0.2 to 3 μm/sec is that less than 0.2 μm/sec leads to a reduction in productivity and more than 3 μm leads to a difficulty in control of the shape of wafer because of being obstructive to the progress of etching as a matter of practice. The reason of why the etching rate of the second etching solution <b>22</b> is limited in the range of 0.01 to 1 μm/sec is that less than 0.01 μm/sec leads to being virtually incapable of processing etching and controlling wafer forming and more than 1 μm/sec leads to insufficient effects because of a decrease in difference of the etching rates with the first etching solution. The above first etching solution <b>21</b> may be one having a weight ratio (% by weight) of fluorinated acid (HF):nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>):phosphate (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>):water (H<sub>2</sub>O)=(5 to 20):(5 to 40):(30 to 40):remainder (rest) after mixing with an aqueous acid solution. The second etching solution <b>22</b> may be one having a weight ratio (% by weight) of fluorinated acid (HF):nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>):phosphate (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>):water (H<sub>2</sub>O)=(0.5 to 10):(20 to 50):(30 to 40) remainder (rest).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Furthermore, when the supply flow rate of each of the first and second etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> is changed, the supply flow rate of the first etching solution <b>21</b> is adjusted to preferably 1 to 10 l/min, more preferably 2 to 5 l/min. The supply flow rate of the second etching solution <b>22</b> is adjusted to one smaller than the supply flow rate, and preferably 0.1 to 5 l/min, more preferably 0.5 to 3 l/min. Here, the reason of why the supply flow rate of the first etching solution <b>21</b> is limited within the range of 1 to 10 l/min is that less than 1 l/min leads to being obstructive to the progress of etching and more than 10 l/min leads to a decrease in effect to plant costs because of enlargement of facilities. The reason of why the supply flow rate of the second etching solution <b>22</b> is limited within the range of 0.1 to 5 l/min is that less than 0.1 l/min leads to offset of the effects of the second etching solution <b>22</b> and more than 5 l/m leads to unstable liquid conditions because of an increase in liquid interference.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The method for etching the wafer <b>11</b> using the single wafer etching apparatus <b>10</b> as constructed above will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">At first, in the state that the wafer <b>11</b> is mounted on the chuck <b>12</b>, a vacuum pump, which is connected to and communicated with the bottom end of the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c </i>of a holding assembly <b>16</b>, is actuated to make the pressures of the through hole <b>16</b> <i>c</i>, communicating hole <b>16</b> <i>d</i>, small hole <b>16</b> <i>f</i>, and ring groove <b>16</b> <i>e </i>negative, and the negative pressures then keep the wafer <b>11</b> in a horizontal position. In this state, the driving motor of the spinning device is actuated to allow the wafer <b>11</b> to spin in horizontal plane together with the holding assembly <b>16</b> and the base member <b>13</b>. Alternatively, only the holding axis <b>21</b> may spin, while the base member <b>19</b> is not allowed to spin and fixed. Subsequently, the rotary motor <b>41</b> <i>a </i>of the first nozzle-moving device <b>41</b> and the stepping motor <b>42</b> <i>a </i>of the second nozzle-moving device <b>42</b> are respectively driven so as to move the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> to a position that allows the discharge opening <b>31</b> <i>a </i>to face to the center of the front surface of the wafer and so as to turn the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> to a position that allows the discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>to face to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer, and then the first and second pumps <b>51</b> <i>c</i>, <b>52</b> <i>c </i>are driven and the first and second flow control valves <b>51</b> <i>d</i>, <b>52</b> <i>d </i>are opened so as to supply the first and second etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> from the first and second discharge openings <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>32</b> <i>a </i>of the first and second supply nozzles <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> to the center of the front surface and the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, respectively. The first etching solution <b>21</b> supplied on the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> gradually moves toward the edge portion of the wafer <b>11</b> from the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> while etching a processing-strained layer on the front surface of the wafer. The centrifugal force with the spinning movement of the wafer <b>11</b> makes most of the first and second etching solutions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> on the wafer <b>11</b> into droplets and scatters these droplets outside of the wafer <b>11</b>, followed by discharging them outside of the chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Here, when the first etching solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to the center of the front surface of the wafer is set to a temperature higher than the temperature of the second etching solution supplied from the second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer, the etching rate of the wafer with the first etching solution increases higher than the etching rate of the second etching solution. As a result, the excessive etching of the periphery of the wafer <b>11</b> can be compensated and the wafer <b>11</b> can be effectively provided with high flatness. In addition, when the first etching solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to the center of the front surface of the wafer is an etching solution having a higher etching rate than that of the second etching solution supplied from the second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer, the etching rate of the wafer with the first etching solution is higher than the etching rate of the wafer with the second etching solution. As a result, the excessive etching of the periphery of the wafer <b>11</b> can be compensated and the wafer can be effectively provided with high flatness. Furthermore, when the supply flow rate of the first etching solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to the center of the front surface of the wafer is higher than the supply flow rate of the second etching solution supplied from the second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer, the etching rate of the wafer with the first etching solution increases higher than the etching rate of the wafer with the second etching solution. As a result, the excessive etching of the periphery of the wafer <b>11</b> is compensated and the wafer can be effectively provided with high flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Note that although the embodiment has been explained for a situation for repairing an excessive etching of a periphery of a wafer <b>11</b> which becomes problematic upon etching by a single supply nozzle, the present invention is not limited thereto. Since a surface shape of a wafer after slicing or of a wafer subjected to a mechanical flattening process including lapping after slicing, is not uniform in a radial direction of the wafer and has a thickness variation, undulations, and the like caused thereon, it is enough to conduct etching so as to repair them. Namely, it is possible to effectively attain high flatness of a wafer <b>11</b>, by previously measuring a surface shape of the wafer <b>11</b> before etching, and by adjusting one or more conditions selected from the group consisting of temperatures, kinds, and supply flow rates of etching solutions to be supplied from the etching solution supply nozzles, depending on the surface shape of the wafer, so as to compensate for a difference between the measured surface shape and an intended surface shape of the wafer <b>11</b> after etching. Furthermore, although the above embodiment has been described for a situation where the number of supply nozzles is two, the supply nozzles may be three, four, or more, in number.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a wafer obtained by slicing a silicon single crystal ingot was subjected to chamfering and mechanical grinding (lapping), so that there was also prepared a silicon wafer <b>11</b> of 300 mm in diameter of which front and back surfaces were flattened. In addition, a first etching solution <b>21</b> was prepared by mixing an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 50%, an aqueous nitric acid solution at a weight concentration of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 85% in a volume ratio of 4:7.4:6 and then reserved in a first tank <b>51</b> <i>a </i>heated at 30° C. On the other hand, a second etching solution <b>22</b> was prepared by mixing 50% by weight concentration of an aqueous fluorine acid solution, 70% by weight concentration of an aqueous nitric acid solution, and 80% by weight concentration of an aqueous phosphoric acid solution in a volume ratio of 4:7.4:6 and then reserved in a second tank <b>52</b> <i>a </i>heated at 20° C. Under such conditions, a wafer <b>11</b> was mounted on a chuck <b>12</b> such that the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> was faced upwardly. Subsequently, the wafer <b>11</b> was horizontally rotated. After that, the first discharge opening <b>31</b> <i>a </i>of a first supply nozzle <b>31</b> was then reciprocated between −50 mm to +50 mm from a basic point (0 mm), which was the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, or the center of the wafer <b>11</b>, at a velocity of 40 mm/sec, while the second discharge opening <b>32</b> <i>a </i>of a second supply nozzle <b>32</b> was then reciprocated between 30 mm to 0 mm from a basic point (0 mm), which was the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>, or the periphery of the wafer <b>11</b>, at a velocity of 40 mm/sec. Under such conditions, the first etching solution <b>21</b> was supplied from the first supply nozzle <b>31</b> onto the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> at a flow rate of 4 l/min, while the second etching solution <b>22</b> was supplied from the second supply nozzle <b>32</b> onto the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b>. By centrifugal force generated by the horizontal spinning of the wafer <b>11</b>, the first etching solution <b>21</b> was spread out from the center of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> to the edge thereof, while the second etching solution <b>22</b> was spread out from the periphery of the front surface of the wafer <b>11</b> to the side end thereof, thereby etching a processing-strained layer caused by the planarization processing of the wafer <b>11</b>.
