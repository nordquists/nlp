<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">A substrate, which is suitable for epitaxial growth of an epitaxial layer in an optoelectronic device, often has poor thermal or electrical conductivity. Therefore, in consideration of the above problems and the epitaxial quality, the fabrication of the optoelectronic device usually includes a step of removing the epitaxial layer from a temporary substrate used for epitaxial growth of the epitaxial layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Usually, a sacrificial layer is formed between the epitaxial layer and the temporary substrate, and thus, the epitaxial layer can be removed from the temporary substrate by etching the sacrificial layer using a fluorine-containing etchant, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">However, although the fluorine-containing etchant can rapidly etch the sacrificial layer, the etchant is likely to result in corrosion of etching equipments and would be harmful to the environment.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the preferred embodiment of a method for fabricating an epitaxial structure according to this invention comprises the following steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In step <b>10</b>, a patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b> is formed over a temporary substrate <b>2</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The temporary substrate <b>2</b> may be made of, for example, silicon, sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon carbide, gallium arsenide, etc., and is exposed partially from the patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b>. The patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b> is made of oxide, and is preferably made of silicon oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In step <b>11</b>, a temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> is grown laterally and epitaxially over the patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b> and the temporary substrate <b>2</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In the preferred embodiment, the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> is made of gallium nitride (GaN).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In step <b>12</b>, a first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> is epitaxially grown over the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> to have a thickness greater than 0.001 micron, and has an epitaxial temperature ranging from 500° C. to 1200° C. The first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> is made of aluminum-containing nitride. Preferably, the aluminum-containing nitride includes at least 5% atomic ratio of aluminum, such as aluminum nitride, aluminum indium gallium nitride, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In step <b>13</b>, an epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> is grown over the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) so as to form an intermediate epitaxial structure. The epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> may be a gallium nitride layer for epitaxial growth of different elements thereon in subsequent processes, or may be a light emitting diode (LED) element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In step <b>14</b>, a permanent substrate <b>7</b> is formed over the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> oppositely of the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b>. The permanent substrate <b>7</b> may be made of silicon, copper-containing material, molybdenum, flexible material, etc. Besides, based on actual requirements, the permanent substrate <b>7</b> may be made of a material having superior thermal conductivity to serve as a heat-dissipation substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In step <b>15</b>, the patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b> is removed using a first etchant (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b> has an etching rate greater than that of the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b>. The first etchant is preferably a fluorine-containing solution, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF), a buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution, etc., and is more preferably HF. Because the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> is patterned, the fluorine-containing solution, which has adverse affect to etching equipments and the environment as previously described in the Description of the Related Art, can be used in a reduced amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">After removing the patterned sacrificial layer <b>3</b>, channels <b>40</b> are formed between the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> and the temporary substrate <b>2</b>. Thus, the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> has an increased surface area that can be reactive to a second etchant, thereby resulting in an increase in the etching rate of the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">In step <b>16</b>, the second etchant is introduced into the channels <b>40</b> to etch and remove the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the temporary substrate <b>2</b> is removed from assembly of the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b>, the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b>, and the permanent substrate <b>7</b>. The second etchant is preferably selected from a potassium hydroxide solution and a phosphoric acid solution, and is more preferably a phosphoric acid solution. In this step, the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> has an etching rate greater than that of the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b>. Preferably, the etching rate of the temporary epitaxial film <b>4</b> is at least five times greater than that of the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b>. As such, the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> can be used to protect the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> from etching by the second etchant. Thus, with the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b>, the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> is unlikely to be etched by the second etchant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In other embodiments, a second etching-stop layer <b>8</b> may be formed on at least one of upper and lower surfaces of the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>). The second etching-stop layer <b>8</b> is preferably made of a material selected from a nitrogen-containing material and a silicon-containing material, has a thickness greater than 0.001 micron, and has an epitaxial temperature ranging from 500° C. to 1200° C. Examples of the nitrogen-containing material include gallium nitride, indium gallium nitride, etc. The nitrogen-containing material is preferably a silicon nitride material (for example, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) that includes at least 20% atomic ratio of nitrogen. Examples of the silicon-containing material include silicon, silicon nitride, etc. The silicon-containing material is preferably a silicide material (for example, CrSi<sub>x</sub>, TaSi<sub>x</sub>) that includes at least 30% atomic ratio of silicon. With the first and second etching-stop layers <b>5</b>, <b>8</b>, the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b> can be protected in a more efficient way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Finally, in step <b>17</b>, the first etching-stop layer <b>5</b> and the second etching-stop layer(s) <b>8</b> (if any) are removed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). An inductive coupling plasma etching process (ICP), a reactive ion etch process (RIE), or a polishing process can be used in this step without causing damage to the epitaxial layer unit <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">While the present invention has been described in connection with what are considered the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretations and equivalent arrangements.</div>
