<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 13/348,752 filed on Jan. 12, 2012 which is based on and claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-7056 filed on Jan. 17, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present disclosure relates to a compound semiconductor substrate and a manufacturing method of a compound semiconductor substrate.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">A power semiconductor device formed in a SiC semiconductor substrate, which has a larger property value than Si, can achieve a greater performance than a power semiconductor device formed in Si. Specifically, because SiC can function as semiconductor to a high temperature due to a wide energy gap (about 3 times wider than Si), SiC can have a high breakdown voltage due to a high dielectric breakdown voltage (about 10 times higher than Si), and SiC has an excellent radiation performance due to high thermal conductivity (about 3 times higher than Si), SiC can achieve higher current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">This kind of SiC semiconductor substrate has polar faces of Si-face ((0001) Si-face) and C-face ((000-1) C-face), and properties depend on the polar faces. Thus, when a device is formed using a SiC semiconductor substrate, a choice of polar face becomes important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The polar face means a surface which is an ideal surface without defects and on which exposure probabilities of atoms constituting of a compound semiconductor (Si and C in a case of SiC) are not equal to each other. In other words, on a C-face in a SiC semiconductor substrate, mainly C is exposed from a substrate surface and an exposure probability of C is higher than Si, and on a SiC-face, mainly Si is exposed from a substrate surface and an exposure probability of Si is higher than C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">For example, in a case of SiC semiconductor substrate, a C-face has a lower contact resistance than a Si-face (for example, see Patent Document No. 1), and a C-face has a higher thermal oxidation rate than a Si-face (for example, see Patent Document No. 2). Furthermore, in a case where a MOSFET and the like is formed on a C-face, a channel mobility is high (for example, see Nonpatent Document No. 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The same as a SiC semiconductor substrate holds true for a gallium nitride (hereafter, referred to as GaN) semiconductor substrate. Specifically, a GaN semiconductor substrate has polar faces of a Ga-face and a N-face. In a GaN semiconductor substrate, it is known that growth on a Ga-face provides a high crystal quality, and it is general to form a device using a Ga-face as a front surface so that a high-quality epitaxial layer can be formed (for example, see Patent Document No. 3). On the other hand, in a GaN semiconductor substrate, a Ga-face has a lower contact resistance than a N-face. Thus, it is preferable that a rear surface is a Ga-face in order to reduce a contact resistance with a rear electrode (for example, see Nonpatent Document No. 2).</div>

</ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, in a SiC semiconductor substrate and a GaN semiconductor substrate, a front surface and a rear surface have different polar faces. Thus, in a case where a vertical device is formed, the same polar face cannot be chosen on both of the front surface and the rear surface. Thus, in a case of a SiC semiconductor substrate, when a Si-face is set to a front surface, a C-face has to be a rear surface, and when a C-face is set to a front surface, a Si-face has to be a rear surface. Thus, for example, when a vertical MOSFET is formed using a C-face as a front surface, a drain electrode has to be formed on a Si-face, and a contact resistance becomes high. Similarly, in a GaN semiconductor substrate, when a Ga-face is set to a front surface, a N-face has to be a rear surface, and when a N-face is see to a front surface, a Ga-face is set to a rear surface. In this way, in a conventional compound semiconductor substrate, a preferable polar face can be used on only one of a front surface and a rear surface.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A SiC semiconductor substrate according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Using the SiC semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, for example, a vertical power MOSFET can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vertical power MOSFET is made of n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>. Plane directions of both surfaces of a front surface and a rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> are (000-1) C-faces. The n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> has an n type impurity, such as nitrogen, concentration of, for example, 1.0×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and has a thickness of about 300 μm. The n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> is formed by bonding an n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and an n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> in a state where a (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and a (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> face each other, and both of exposed surfaces are (000-1) C-faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">On a surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, an n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> made of SiC is epitaxially grown. The n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> has an n type impurity, such as, nitrogen, concentration of, for example, from 5.0×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2.0×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and has a thickness of from 8 to 15 μm. Because the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is formed on the surface of the (000-1) C-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, a plane direction of the surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is a (000-1) C-face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">At predetermined region in a surface portion of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b>, p type base regions <b>3</b> having a predetermined depth are formed so as to be away from each other. In addition, in a surface portion of the p type base region <b>3</b>, an n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> shallower than the p type base region <b>3</b> and having a high impurity concentration is formed. Furthermore, in the surface portion of the p type base region <b>3</b>, a p<sup>+ </sup>type contact layer <b>5</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The p type base region <b>3</b> has a p type impurity, such as boron or aluminum, concentration of, for example, from 5.0×10<sup>16 </sup>to 2.0×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and has a thickness of about 2.0 μm. The n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> has an n type impurity, such as phosphorous, concentration (surface concentration) of, for example, 1.0×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>in a surface portion, and has a thickness of about 0.3 μm. The p<sup>+ </sup>type contact layer <b>5</b> has a p type impurity, such as boron or aluminum, concentration (surface concentration) of, for example, 1.0×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>in a surface portion, and has a thickness of about 0.3 μm. In one cell, two n<sup>+ </sup>type source regions <b>4</b> are disposed opposite each other with a predetermined distance therebetween. The p<sup>+ </sup>type contact layers <b>5</b> are disposed on both sides of the n<sup>+ </sup>type source regions <b>4</b> to sandwich the n<sup>+ </sup>type source regions <b>4</b>, which are disposed opposite each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The p type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> are formed by implanting ions into the surface portion of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> or by epitaxially grown on the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b>. In each case, the p type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> inherit the (000-1) C-face, which is the plane direction of the surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, in a manner similar to the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b>, and plane directions of the surfaces are the (000-1) C-faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Furthermore, a gate insulation layer <b>6</b> is formed on a surface portion of the p<sup>− </sup>type base region <b>3</b> between the n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> and the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> and on a surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b>, and a gate electrode <b>7</b> is formed on the gate insulation layer <b>6</b>. In addition, the gate electrode <b>7</b> is covered with an interlayer insulation layer <b>8</b>, and a source electrode <b>9</b> is formed on the interlayer insulation layer <b>8</b>. The source electrode <b>9</b> is electrically coupled with the n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> and the p<sup>+ </sup>type contact region <b>5</b> through a contact hole provided in the interlayer insulation layer <b>8</b>. On a rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, a drain electrode <b>10</b> is formed. The vertical power MOSFET has the above-described configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one cell of the vertical power MOSFET in the SiC semiconductor device. Actually, a plurality of cells having a cross-sectional structure similar to the cross-sectional structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is continuously arranged to form the SiC semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The SiC semiconductor device including the vertical power MOSFET having the above-described structure is formed using the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> in which both of the plane directions of the front surface and the rear surface are the (000-1) C-faces. Thus, all of the plane directions of n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> and the p<sup>+ </sup>type contact region <b>5</b>, which are in contact with the source electrode <b>9</b>, and a contact surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, which is in contact with the drain electrode <b>10</b>, are (000-1) C-faces. Thus, compared with a case where one of the surfaces of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> is a (0001) Si-face, a contact resistance with the drain electrode <b>10</b> can be reduced. In addition, a thermal oxidation rate in a case where the gate insulation layer <b>6</b> is formed by thermal oxidation can be high, and channel mobility can also be high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Next, a manufacturing method of a SiC semiconductor substrate that can be used in manufacture of the SiC semiconductor device having the above-described configuration will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> made of single crystal 4H—SiC are prepared. Each of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> is high quality and has flat surfaces, and a plane direction of one surface is a (0001) Si-face and a plane direction of the other surface is a (000-1) C-face. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, 4H—SiC has a hexagonal crystal structure in which Si and C are alternately bonded to form hexagonal shapes. Thus, 4H—SiC has two polar faces. One of the polar faces is a (000-1) C-face in which mainly C atoms are exposed from a substrate surface, and the other is a (0001) Si-face in which mainly Si atoms are exposed from a substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">As the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, not only on-substrates in which a plane direction of a front surface and a plane direction of a rear surface are just surfaces of a (0001) Si-face and the (000-1) C-face but also off-substrates having an off-angle with respect to the just surfaces can be used. When off-substrates are used, off-directions and off-angles of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> may be different from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">After the (0001) Si-faces of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are planarized so that surface roughness Ra become less than or equal to 5 nm, a surface treatment with HF is performed. Then, hydrogen ions or rare gas ions are implanted from one of the surfaces of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b>, which is planarized and is treated with HF. For example, hydrogen ions or rare gas ions are implanted from the (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate with an acceleration energy of 200 keV and a dose amount of 2.0×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. By performing the ion implantation in such a manner that a hydrogen ion concentration or a rare gas ion concentration becomes maximum at a position of a predetermined depth, a damage layer <b>13</b> in which hydrogen ions or rare gas ions and crystal defects are high-densely segregated is formed. The acceleration energy and the dose amount are set based on a required forming depth of the damage layer <b>13</b>. On the above-described condition, the damage layer <b>13</b> can be formed at a depth of about 1.3 μm. After that, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> are arranged in such a manner that the (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> face each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">A cap oxidation layer for preventing a channeling may be formed on the surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> during the ion implantation and may be removed after the ion implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a die <b>14</b> having a hollow cylindrical shape and made of carbon and a punch <b>15</b> having a column shape and having the same diameter as a hollow portion of the die <b>14</b> are prepared. Then, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> in which the damage layer <b>13</b> is formed and the n<sup>+ </sup>type substrate <b>12</b> are disposed in the die <b>14</b>. After that, the punch <b>15</b> is arranged on both sides of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and a pressure of 100 kgf/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied. Accordingly, the (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the (0001) Si-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> are bonded to each other. If the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are heated when the pressure is applied, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are bonded more tightly. Thus, in various processes of forming elements performed in later processes, a detachment at bonded surfaces can be restricted with certainty. However, when both of the bonded surfaces are planarized as the present embodiment, bonding is possible without heating. Thus, a heating process can be omitted, a recombination in the damage layer <b>13</b> during the heating process can be restricted, and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> can be detached at the damage layer <b>13</b> with certainty in a next detaching process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> after bonding are removed from a mold including the die <b>14</b> and the punch <b>15</b>. Then, the detaching process in which a portion of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> is detached is performed. For example, when the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> removed from the mold is placed in a heating furnace and a heat treatment is performed in the heating furnace at 900° C. for 30 minutes, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> is detached at the damage layer <b>13</b> in which crystal defects are generated by implanting hydrogen ions. Accordingly, a thickness of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> becomes a desired thickness, and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate in which both surfaces are the (000-1) C-faces is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, Si atoms are bonded in a joint interface and C atoms are arranged on exposed surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, on one surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b>, which works as an active region, is formed by epitaxially growing SiC having a low impurity concentration. At this time, because the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is formed on the surface of the single crystal n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, a crystalline of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> inherits a crystalline of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, and a surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is also a (000-1) C-face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">After the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is formed on the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> through the above-described process, a known device forming process is performed. Accordingly, the vertical power MOSFET shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is manufactured. In other words, the p type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type source region <b>4</b> are formed by ion-implanting impurities to the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> using a mask and performing an activation thermal process, and then the gate insulating layer <b>6</b> is formed, for example, by thermal oxidation. After that, the gate electrode <b>7</b> is formed by forming a layer of doped Poly-Si and patterning. Then, through a forming process of the interlayer insulation layer, a forming process of the contact hole, a patterning process of the source electrode <b>9</b> and the gate wiring, and a forming process of the drain electrode <b>10</b>, the vertical power MOSFET shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is completed.</div>

<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">A GaN semiconductor substrate according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. Using the GaN semiconductor substrate according to the present embodiment, for example, a vertical Schottky barrier diode can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vertical Schottky barrier diode is formed using an n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> as a GaN semiconductor substrate. Both of a front surface and a rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> are (0001) Ga-faces. In a manner similar to the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> described in the first embodiment, the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> is formed by bonding two n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> in a state where a (000-1) N-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>31</b> and a (000-1) N-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>32</b> face each other, and both of exposed surfaces are (0001) Ga-faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">On a surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>, an n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> made of GaN is formed. Because the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> is formed on the surface of the (0001) Ga-face of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>, a plane direction of the surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> is a (0001) Ga-face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">On a surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b>, a Schottky electrode <b>23</b> made of, for example, Au is formed. On a rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>, a rear electrode <b>24</b> made of Ti, which forms an ohmic contact with the rear surface, is formed. The GaN semiconductor device including the vertical Schottky barrier diode has the above-described configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The GaN semiconductor device including the vertical Schottky barrier diode having the above-described configuration is formed using the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> in which plane directions of both of the front surface and the rear surface are (0001) Ga-faces. Thus, the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> of high crystal quality can be formed at a front-surface side of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>, and a contact resistance between the rear electrode <b>24</b> and a GaN contact surface can be reduced at a rear-surface side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Next, a manufacturing method of a GaN semiconductor substrate that is used in manufacture of the GaN semiconductor device having the above-described configuration will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The manufacturing method of the GaN semiconductor substrate according to the present embodiment is almost similar to the manufacturing method of the SiC semiconductor substrate according to the first embodiment. Thus, a different part will be mainly described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the two single crystal n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are prepared. Each of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> is high quality and has flat surfaces, and a plane direction of one surface is a (0001) Ga-face and a plane direction of the other surface is a (000-1) N-face. Single crystal GaN has two polar faces. One of the polar faces is a (0001) Ga-face in which mainly Ge atoms are exposed from a substrate surface, and the other is a (000-1) N-face in which mainly N atoms are exposed from a substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">As the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, not only on-substrates in which a plane direction of a front surface and a plane direction of a rear surface are just surfaces of a (0001) Ga-face and the (000-1) N-face but also off-substrates having an off-angle with respect to the just surfaces can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">After the (000-1) N-faces of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are planarized so that surface roughness Ra become less than or equal to 5 nm, a surface treatment with HF is performed. Then, the (000-1) N-faces of the two n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are arranged so as to face each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a mold including a die <b>14</b> and a punch <b>15</b> similar to the first embodiment is used. The n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed in the mold in a state where the (000-1) N-faces face each other. After that, the punch <b>15</b> is arranged on both sides of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and a pressure of 100 kgf/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied. Accordingly, the (0001) N-faces of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are bonded to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> after bonding are removed from the mold including the die <b>14</b> and the punch <b>15</b>. Then, one of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> is polished so as to have a thickness of about 10 μm. Accordingly, the sum of thicknesses of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> becomes a desired thickness, and the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> whose both surfaces are (0001) Ga-faces is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, on one surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> completed as described above, the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> is formed by epitaxially growing GaN having a low impurity concentration. At this time, because the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> is formed on the surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>, which is (0001) Ga-face, the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> having a high crystal quality can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">After the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> is formed on the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> through the above-described process, a known device forming process is performed. Accordingly, the vertical Schottky barrier diode shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is manufactured. In other words, the Schottky electrode <b>23</b> is formed by forming Au layer on the surface of the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> and then patterning. Furthermore, the rear electrode <b>24</b> made of Ti is formed on the rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b>. At this time, because the rear surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> is also the (0001) Ga-face, the rear electrode <b>24</b> can make the ohmic contact with a low contact resistance with respect to the GaN contact surface. In this way, the vertical Schottky barrier diode shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As described above, in the present embodiment, by bonding the (000-1) N-faces of the two n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>21</b> whose both surfaces are (0001) Ga-faces can be manufactured. Accordingly, a compound semiconductor substrate in which a desired polar face can be used both on the front surface and the rear surface can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In addition, when a vertical element, such as, a vertical Schottky barrier diode, is formed using the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate whose both surfaces are (0001) Ga-face, the n<sup>− </sup>type epitaxial layer <b>22</b> of high crystal quality can be formed on the front-surface side of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>1</b>, and a contact resistance between the rear electrode <b>24</b> and the GaN contact surface can be reduced at a rear-surface side.</div>
<heading>Third Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">A third embodiment according to the present invention will be described. In the present disclosure, a configuration and a manufacturing method of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> are changed from the first embodiment. Because the others are similar to the first embodiment, only a part different from the first embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, also in the present embodiment, a vertical power MOSFET having a structure similar to the first embodiment is provided. As the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> are bonded with a conductive adhesive agent <b>16</b> having a high conductivity. The conductive adhesive agent <b>16</b> may be made of, for example, carbon adhesive having a volume resistance of 1.0×10<sup>−2 </sup>Ω·cm and has a thickness of, for example, about 1 μm. The other configurations are similar to the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">A manufacturing method of the SiC semiconductor device according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, which has been described in the first embodiment, is performed. Then, in a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, after the conductive adhesive agent <b>16</b> is applied to the (0001) Si-face of one of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, the (0001) Si-faces of the two n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are faced each other, and the two n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are bonded to each other through the conductive adhesive agent <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">After that, in a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, which has been described in the first embodiment, is performed. Accordingly, a portion of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> is detached, and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate having a desired thickness and whose both surfaces are (000-1) C-faces is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In this way, also when the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> between which the conductive adhesive agent <b>16</b> is arranged is used as the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b>, effects similar to the first embodiment can be achieved.</div>
<heading>Other Embodiments</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In the first and third embodiments, the cases in which the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> made of 4H—SiC are used, has been described. However, not limited to 4H—SiC, SiC having other crystal structure may also be used. The crystal structure may also be different. For example, the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> may be made of 4H—SiC, and the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>12</b> may be made of 6H—SiC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In the first and the third embodiment, the cases in which the vertical power MOSFET is formed in the SiC semiconductor substrate as the vertical semiconductor element has been described. However, other vertical semiconductor element, such as a vertical Schottky barrier diode as described in the second embodiment, may also be formed. In contrast, in the second embodiment, the case in which the vertical Schottky barrier diode is formed in the GaN semiconductor substrate as the vertical semiconductor element has been described. However, other vertical semiconductor element, such as a vertical power MOSFET as described in the first embodiment, may also be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Because the n channel type vertical power MOSFET has been described as an example in the above-described embodiments, the structure in which the n<sup>− </sup>type drift layer <b>2</b> is formed on the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>1</b> has been described. However, in a case of an n channel type vertical IGBT, a p<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate is used. In this case, a p<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate whose both surfaces are (000-1) C-faces may be manufactured by the above-described manufacturing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In the first and third embodiments, the n channel type vertical power MOSFET has been described as an example. However, a p channel type vertical power MOSFET in which a conductivity type of each part is inverted may also be manufactured. It is needless to say that, also other vertical semiconductor element, such as IGBT, can be manufactured using the SiC semiconductor substrate manufactured by the above-described manufacturing method regardless of a conductivity of each of two substrates. In this case, one of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> may be changed to a p<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate, and SiC substrates having different conductivities may be bonded to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In the first and third embodiments, the portion of the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> is detached at the damage layer <b>13</b> by the heat treatment. The portion of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>31</b> can be detached from the damage layer <b>13</b> by applying external force. In addition, although the case in which the damage layer <b>13</b> is formed in the n<sup>+ </sup>type SiC substrate <b>11</b> and the portion is detached at the damage layer <b>13</b> has been described, the detachment of the n<sup>+ </sup>type GaN substrate <b>31</b> as the second embodiment can also be performed by forming a damage layer by implanting hydrogen gas or rare gas ion.</div>
