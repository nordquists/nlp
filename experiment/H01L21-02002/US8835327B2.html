<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-58582, filed on Mar. 15, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments discussed herein are related to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A semiconductor device such as an LSI is manufactured by undergoing various processes including etching, CVD (chemical vapor deposition), and the like. A semiconductor manufacturing apparatus configured to perform these processes includes a substrate pedestal located inside a chamber. A semiconductor substrate is heated to a given temperature by the substrate pedestal and is then subjected to various processes in this state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known that particles may be generated by rubbing between the substrate pedestal and the semiconductor substrate in the course of the processes because there is a difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the substrate pedestal and the semiconductor substrate. Such particles lead to reduction in yield of semiconductor devices and it is therefore preferable to suppress generation of the particles in order to improve the yield.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">There is proposed a method applicable to a case of using an electrostatic chuck as the substrate pedestal. The method intends to suppress generation of particles by using a pulse voltage as a voltage for generating an electrostatic attractive force after a semiconductor substrate is mounted on the electrostatic chuck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this method, the semiconductor substrate is allowed to slide on the electrostatic chuck because the electrostatic attractive force disappears in a period when the voltage is set to 0 V. Thus, a stress attributed to a difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the semiconductor substrate and the electrostatic chuck is relaxed and the number of particles is supposed to be reduced as a consequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, if the electrostatic attractive force is caused to disappear frequently as described above, then it takes a long time for starting a process after the semiconductor substrate is mounted on the electrostatic chuck because generation of a sufficient electrostatic attractive force for fixing the semiconductor substrate uses time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The techniques related to this application are disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications No. 2000-21964, No. 2000-260855, No. 2005-38947, and No. 05-304196.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Researches conducted by the inventor of the present application will be explained prior to description of embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus used in the researches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The semiconductor manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b> is an ICP (inductively coupled plasma) etching apparatus which includes a chamber <b>2</b> housing an electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>. The chamber <b>2</b> may be one of multiple chambers or a single chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is provided at a bottom surface of the chamber <b>2</b> and is electrically connected to a first high-frequency power source <b>7</b> used for biasing. A protection ring <b>11</b> made of quartz is provided beside the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> in order to prevent the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> from being damaged by plasmas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, induction coils <b>6</b> are provided above the chamber <b>2</b> while interposing a quartz plate <b>5</b> in-between. Among them, the quartz plate <b>5</b> has a supply port <b>5</b> <i>a </i>for an etching gas G<sub>E </sub>while the induction coils <b>6</b> are electrically connected to a second high-frequency power source <b>8</b> used for plasma generation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Here, a ceramic plate may be provided instead of the quartz plate <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the chamber <b>2</b> includes exhaust ports <b>2</b> <i>a </i>at the bottom surface, and a quartz window <b>4</b> provided on a side surface thereof and used for observing the inside of the chamber <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In actual use, the etching gas G<sub>E </sub>is supplied from the supply port <b>5</b> <i>a </i>into the chamber <b>2</b> while discharging the etching gas G<sub>E </sub>from the exhaust ports <b>2</b> <i>a</i>. In this state, when high-frequency power having a frequency of 13.56 MHz is applied from the second high-frequency power source <b>8</b> to the induction coils <b>6</b>, the etching gas G<sub>E </sub>is transformed into a plasma. Subsequently, when high-frequency power having a frequency of 13.56 MHz is applied from the first high-frequency power source <b>7</b> to the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, the etching gas G<sub>E </sub>transformed into the plasma is attracted to the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and a semiconductor substrate W on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is subjected to etching accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the above-described electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> includes a main body <b>13</b> made of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the like. In addition, a coolant flow channel <b>14</b>, a high-frequency electrode <b>15</b>, chuck electrodes <b>16</b>, and a heater <b>17</b> are provided inside the main body <b>13</b> from bottom up in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Among them, a coolant C such as cooling water cooled by an unillustrated chiller is supplied to the coolant flow channel <b>14</b>. Meanwhile, the high-frequency electrode <b>15</b> is electrically connected to the aforementioned first high-frequency power source <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In the meantime, two polarities of a direct-current voltage V generated by a direct-current power source <b>25</b> are applied to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b>. Meanwhile, the heater <b>17</b> is a heater of a resistive heating type, for example, which is provided in a surface layer of the main body <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The main body <b>13</b> is also provided with first holes <b>13</b> <i>a </i>for helium gas He and second holes <b>13</b> <i>b </i>for lift pins. Among them, helium gas He used for cooling is supplied to the first holes <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and the semiconductor substrate W is cooled from its back surface by the helium gas He.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Meanwhile, a vertically movable lift pin <b>23</b> is inserted through each of the second holes <b>13</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated with dotted lines, the lift pins <b>23</b> move upward when the semiconductor substrate W is accepted in the chamber <b>2</b> or when the semiconductor substrate W is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b>. This movement forms a clearance between the semiconductor substrate W and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, which allows entry of a transport robot arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, when the semiconductor substrate W is subjected to etching, the lift pins <b>23</b> move downward to bring the back surface of the semiconductor substrate W into contact with an upper surface of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, and the semiconductor substrate W is fixed to the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> by an electrostatic attractive force generated by the chuck electrodes <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, the semiconductor substrate W is heated by applying electricity to and thereby turning on the heater <b>17</b>. Etching is promoted by heating the semiconductor substrate W as described above. In addition, a volatile reaction product generated by etching is quickly discharged from the chamber <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, either a pressure of the helium gas He to be supplied from the first holes <b>13</b> <i>a </i>may be increased or a flow rate of the coolant C flowing on the coolant flow channel <b>14</b> may be increased in order to bring the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W down to a room temperature (about 20° C.). An etching reaction is suppressed by lowering the temperature as described above. As a consequence, processing accuracy of etching with a resist film serving as an etching mask is improved by preventing wear of the resist film or reducing deformation of the resist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that the heater <b>17</b> does not always have to be turned off at the time of lowering the temperature. Instead, the heater <b>17</b> may be constantly turned on while reducing a current to be fed to the heater, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, it may be also possible to improve etching shift, etching selectivity, in-plane uniformity of an etching amount, and the like by controlling the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> in the course of etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Meanwhile, a thermometer <b>26</b> such as a thermocouple for monitoring the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is provided on a back surface of the main body <b>13</b>. In the following description, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> means the temperature measured with the thermometer <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In the meantime, when etching is started, the semiconductor substrate W is mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> by moving the lift pins <b>23</b> downward. However, the semiconductor substrate W is in a state of standby in an atmosphere outside the chamber <b>2</b> before being mounted. The semiconductor substrate W stands by in any of an unillustrated load lock chamber, an unillustrated transfer chamber, and the like located outside the chamber <b>2</b>. The atmosphere in the chambers other than the chamber <b>2</b> is set to a room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">For this reason, if the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is always heated to a temperature higher than the room temperature before the semiconductor substrate W is mounted thereon, a temperature difference occurs between the semiconductor substrate W and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at the point when the semiconductor substrate W is mounted thereon. Such a temperature difference is thought to be a cause of expansion of the semiconductor substrate W and generation of particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">With that in mind, the inventor of the present application has conducted researches on aspects of changes in the number of particles at various temperatures of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at the point when the semiconductor substrate W is mounted thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates results of the researches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In each of researches A to E in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an increase in the number of particles on the semiconductor substrate W is counted by comparing a state before the semiconductor substrate W is put into the chamber <b>2</b> with a state after the semiconductor substrate W is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In the researches, a silicon substrate having bare silicon surfaces is used as the semiconductor substrate W, and the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W before being put into the chamber <b>2</b> is set to a room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Meanwhile, among the researches A to E, a research having a plurality of bars in the corresponding graph represents the research conducted for a plurality of times under the same conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the research A, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is set to 60° C. Then, after the semiconductor substrate W is brought into contact with the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at 60° C. by moving the lift pins <b>23</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) downward, the lift pins <b>23</b> are moved upward and the semiconductor substrate W is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b> without etching the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The increase in the number of particles turns out to be high values in a range from about 270 to 470 under the condition of setting the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> to a high temperature such as 60° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The increase in the number of particles may also depend on cumulative use time of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, a well-used electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> having cumulative use time of about a half year is employed in the next research B, and the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is set to 60° C. as in the case of the research A. In the research B, however, the semiconductor substrate W is mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> by moving the lift pins <b>23</b> downward, and is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b> after etching the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The increase in the number of particles reaches high values in a range from about 190 to 230 in this case as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In the next research C, the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is replaced with a new component in order to check whether or not the high value mentioned above will reflect the cumulative use time. Note that the conditions in the research C are the same as those in the research B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the increase in the number of particles reaches high values in a range from about 80 to 340 in the research C as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">It is evident from the results of the researches A to C that a number of particles are generated irrespective of whether or not etching is performed in the chamber <b>2</b>, and whether or not the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is new.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Hence, the inventor of the present application considers that the generation of particles is attributable to the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>. In the research D, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is set to 40° C. which is lower than the temperature in the researches A to C. Here, the conditions in the research D are the same as those in the research B except the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, and the well-used electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> having cumulative use time of about a half year is employed therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the research D, the increase in the number of particles is reduced to about 30 even though the well-used electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is employed therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, in the research E, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is set to 40° C. as in the case of the research D, and a new electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is employed therein. Here, the conditions in the research E are the same as those in the research C except the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the increase in the number of particles is reduced to about 30 in this case as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The results of the researches A to E described above demonstrate the fact that lowering the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at the point when the semiconductor substrate W is mounted is effective for reducing the number of particles irrespective of the cumulative use time of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and regardless of whether or not etching is performed inside the chamber <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">This is thought to be attributed to the following reasons. Specifically, the temperature difference between the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and the semiconductor substrate W is reduced by lowering the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, and thermal expansion of the semiconductor substrate W attributed to the temperature difference is suppressed. Hence, the semiconductor substrate W is rubbed less with the surface of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> as a result of less thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Suppression of the thermal expansion of the semiconductor substrate W may also be understood from the following formula (1). The formula (1) is a formula expressing a relation between an expansion amount ΔL of the semiconductor wafer W with respect to its original diameter L and a temperature change Δt of the semiconductor substrate W:
<br/>
Δ<i>L=L∫</i> <sub>T</sub> <sub> <sub2>b</sub2> </sub> <sup>T</sup> <sup> <sub2>a</sub2> </sup> <i>αdt=αL</i>(<i>T</i> <sub>b</sub> <i>−T</i> <sub>a</sub>)=α<i>LΔT</i>  (1)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, T<sub>a </sub>denotes the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W before being mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and T<sub>b </sub>denotes the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Meanwhile, α is a linear expansion coefficient of the semiconductor substrate W, which is defined by the following formula (2):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Note that the thermal expansion coefficient α is defined as a constant in the formula (1) regardless of the temperature T because temperature change is little.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">It is clearly understood from the formula (1) that the expansion amount ΔL becomes smaller as the temperature difference ΔT is smaller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">While the thermal expansion of the semiconductor substrate W is considered as a cause of generation of the particles as described above, the helium gas He used for cooling is also considered as a cause of promoting generation of the particles as described below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In the following, description will be given of a case in which silicon <b>30</b> provided with a silicon oxide film <b>31</b> on its surfaces is used as the semiconductor substrate W, and the semiconductor substrate W is to be mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at the temperature of 60° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">First, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the lift pins <b>23</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are moved upward before the semiconductor substrate W is mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, and the semiconductor substrate W is therefore detached from the main body <b>13</b>. Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate W is not heated by the main body <b>13</b> at this point and the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W is around a room temperature (20° C.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">A plurality of grooves <b>13</b> <i>a </i>for circulating the helium gas He are provided on the surface of the main body <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, the semiconductor substrate W is mounted on the main body <b>13</b> by moving the lift pins <b>23</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) downward as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Thereafter, the semiconductor substrate W is fixed to the main body <b>13</b> by the electrostatic attractive force by applying the direct-current voltage V from the direct-current power source <b>25</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">At this time, the semiconductor substrate W expands as indicated with an arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> due to the temperature difference between the semiconductor substrate W and the main body <b>13</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Then, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, when the helium gas He blows on the back surface of the semiconductor substrate W for the purpose of lowering the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W and the like, the particles P are scattered along the flow of the helium gas He.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The aspect of the silicon oxide film <b>31</b> being peeled off and turning into the particles P has been described above. On the other hand, even if the silicon oxide film <b>31</b> is not provided, other particles P adhering to the back surface of the semiconductor substrate W from the beginning may be scattered by the helium gas He instead. Such particles P are likely to adhere to the back surface of the semiconductor substrate W at the time of resist patterning in a process prior to putting the semiconductor substrate W into the chamber <b>2</b> or at the time of measurement with a measuring instrument.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Meanwhile, when an etching process takes place by using a plurality of chambers, particles may adhere to the back surface of the semiconductor substrate W when the semiconductor substrate W is processed in one of the chambers to which the semiconductor substrate is transported in the first place. In this case, when the semiconductor substrate W is transported to the subsequent chamber and is mounted on the electrostatic chuck, the particles may be scattered due to the expansion caused by the temperature difference between the semiconductor substrate W and the electrostatic chuck and due to the flow of the helium gas, and then the particles P may adhere to the surface of the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">From the results of the researches described above, the temperature difference between the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and the semiconductor substrate W at the point of mounting the substrate W on the chuck <b>3</b> has been specified as the cause of generation of the particles. It is therefore considered to be effective to reduce the temperature difference between the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and the semiconductor substrate W as much as possible in order to suppress generation of the particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">An embodiment designed to suppress generation of the particles by reducing the above-described temperature difference will be described below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">First, trenches for element isolation are formed on a silicon substrate <b>40</b> and a silicon oxide film serving as an element isolation insulating film <b>41</b> is buried into the trenches.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Subsequently, a p-well <b>42</b> is formed by ion implanting a p-type impurity into the silicon substrate <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, an oxide film serving as a gate insulating film <b>43</b> is formed in a thickness of about 0.8 nm to 1.2 nm by thermally oxidizing a surface of the silicon substrate <b>40</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Thereafter, a photoresist is coated on the antireflection film <b>45</b>, and a resist film <b>46</b> in the shape of a gate electrode is formed by subjecting the photoresist to exposure and development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The processes so far provide the semiconductor substrate W to be subjected to etching by the semiconductor manufacturing apparatus <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the semiconductor substrate W is put into the chamber <b>2</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Then, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, low-concentration n-type source-drain extensions <b>51</b> are formed at the portion of the silicon substrate <b>40</b> beside the gate electrode <b>44</b> <i>a </i>by ion implantation while using the gate electrode <b>44</b> <i>a </i>as a mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Subsequently, an insulating film is formed on the entire upper surface of the silicon substrate <b>40</b>, and insulative side walls <b>52</b> are formed beside the gate electrode <b>44</b> <i>a </i>by etching back the insulating film.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In this way, a basic structure of a MOS transistor TR is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, the temperature profile of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> during the process illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view schematically illustrating the temperature profile of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>. Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is maintained at an etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>at time t<sub>0 </sub>before the semiconductor substrate W is accepted. Note that the etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>is a temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at the time of etching a previous semiconductor substrate W, which represents an example of a third temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Although the etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>is not particularly limited, the etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>is set to about 60° C. in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">At this point, the semiconductor substrate W is placed outside the chamber <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate W is maintained at an outside temperature T<sub>2 </sub>which is lower than the etching temperature T<sub>3</sub>. Note that the outside temperature T<sub>2 </sub>represents an example of a second temperature, which is a temperature lower than an acceptance temperature T<sub>1</sub>. The outside temperature T<sub>2 </sub>is a room temperature, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Hence, there is a temperature difference equivalent to T<sub>3</sub>−T<sub>2 </sub>between the semiconductor substrate W and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>. If the semiconductor substrate W is mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> at this point, the particles are generated as described above due to the temperature difference therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">For this reason, the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is cooled in a period from time t<sub>1 </sub>to time t<sub>2 </sub>so as to bring the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> down to the acceptance temperature T<sub>1 </sub>which is lower than the etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>(step S<b>1</b>). The acceptance temperature T<sub>1 </sub>is an example of a first temperature and is set around 40° C., for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Accordingly, the temperature difference between the semiconductor substrate W placed outside the chamber <b>2</b> and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is reduced to T<sub>1</sub>−T<sub>2</sub>, which is smaller than the aforementioned temperature difference T<sub>3</sub>−T<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Although the length of the cooling period (t<sub>2</sub>−t<sub>1</sub>) is not particularly limited, the length of the period is set in a range from about 10 seconds to 30 seconds in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Moreover, in this embodiment, the inside of the chamber <b>2</b> is subjected to cleaning in the course of cooling the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>, thereby removing a reaction product which has adhered to an inner wall of the chamber <b>2</b> at the time of etching the previous semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">This cleaning process is performed by supplying a cleaning gas from the supply port <b>5</b> <i>a </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) into the chamber <b>2</b> without exposing the chamber to the atmosphere, and then transforming the cleaning gas into a plasma by using the first high-frequency power source <b>7</b> and the second high-frequency power source <b>8</b>. This cleaning process is also referred to as dry cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Damages on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> due to the heat may be reduced by performing dry cleaning while cooling the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The cleaning gas to be used in this embodiment is not particularly limited. If silicon is included in the reaction product, then SF<sub>6 </sub>gas, NF<sub>3 </sub>gas or the like may be used as the cleaning gas, for example. Alternatively, oxygen gas may be used as the cleaning gas in order to remove an organic substance in the reaction product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The dry cleaning process is terminated when the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is stabilized at the aforementioned acceptance temperature T<sub>1</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Here, the period for performing the dry cleaning process is not particularly limited. For example, the dry cleaning process may be started during the period from the time t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>2 </sub>when the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is being lowered and may be terminated during this period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Meanwhile, the dry cleaning process may be performed later than the time t<sub>2</sub>, after the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is stabilized at the acceptance temperature T<sub>1</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In the meantime, the dry cleaning process may be initiated before the time t<sub>1 </sub>to start cooling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, at time t<sub>3</sub>, the semiconductor substrate W is placed on the lift pins <b>23</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and then the lift pins <b>23</b> are moved downward so as to mount the semiconductor substrate W on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> (step S<b>2</b>). The period from the time t<sub>2 </sub>to the time t<sub>3 </sub>is set in a range from about 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Here, the temperature difference between the semiconductor substrate W and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is reduced to the value T<sub>1</sub>−T<sub>2 </sub>as described previously.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Although the value of the temperature difference T<sub>1</sub>−T<sub>2 </sub>is not particularly limited, it is preferable to set the temperature difference T<sub>1</sub>−T<sub>2 </sub>equal to or below 20° C. in the light of efficiently suppressing generation of the particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Subsequently, at time t<sub>4</sub>, the direct-current voltage V is applied to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b> and the semiconductor substrate W is thereby fixed onto the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> with the electrostatic attractive force (step S<b>3</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In this embodiment, the direct-current voltage V having a fixed value is constantly applied to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b> without providing a period when the voltage applied to the chuck electrodes becomes equal to 0 V as seen in the conventional method. As a consequence, the electrostatic attractive force is generated at a sufficiently strong level simultaneously with application of the voltage, and fixation of the semiconductor substrate W to the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> therefore takes less time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Then, the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is heated during a period from time t<sub>5 </sub>to time t<sub>6</sub>, and the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is set to the above-mentioned etching temperature T<sub>3 </sub>(step S<b>4</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Thereafter, when the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is stabilized at the etching temperature T<sub>3</sub>, the high-frequency power is applied from each of the first high-frequency power source <b>7</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second high-frequency power source <b>8</b> to the atmosphere in the chamber <b>2</b>, thereby etching the semiconductor substrate W (step S<b>5</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Here, the antireflection film <b>45</b> is etched in the first place. At this time, a mixed gas prepared by adding any one of Cl<sub>2</sub>, HBr, and SO<sub>2 </sub>to oxygen and further adding He gas as a diluents gas thereto is used as the etching gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, the polycrystalline silicon film <b>44</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) is subjected to an etching process which includes four steps. In the first step, an upper portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <b>44</b> is etched by using CF<sub>4 </sub>or Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas in order to remove a natural oxide film (not illustrated) which may often be formed on the polycrystalline film <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In the next second step, a large portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <b>44</b> is etched by using an etching gas, which is a mixed gas of HBr gas, Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas, O<sub>2 </sub>gas, and CF<sub>4 </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In the next third step, the etching gas is changed into a mixed gas of HBr gas and O<sub>2 </sub>gas, and the remaining portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <b>44</b> is subjected to etching. Thus, the gate electrode <b>44</b> <i>a </i>is formed and the gate insulating film <b>43</b> is exposed on the side of the gate electrode <b>44</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Then, in the last fourth step, over-etching is performed in such a manner as not to remove the gate insulating film <b>43</b>, thereby leaving no etching residues on the gate insulating film <b>43</b> exposed in the third step. The etching gas used in this step is a mixed gas of HBr gas, O<sub>2 </sub>gas, and He gas, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">After conducting the etching process as described above, application of the direct-current voltage V to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b> is stopped at time t<sub>7</sub>, thereby releasing the semiconductor substrate W from the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> (step S<b>6</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Then, the lift pins <b>23</b> are moved upward at time t<sub>8 </sub>(step S<b>7</b>). After a lapse of a predetermined time period, the semiconductor substrate W is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b> by way of a transport robot at time t<sub>9 </sub>(step S<b>8</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Thus, the basic steps of the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the embodiment are completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The processes to be performed on the single semiconductor substrate W have been described above. However, when this embodiment is applied to a mass production facility for semiconductor devices, a plurality of the semiconductor substrates W may be prepared and each semiconductor substrate W may be subjected to the series of the steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">In this case, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is cooled down to the above-described acceptance temperature T<sub>1 </sub>in step S<b>1</b> at the point after the previous semiconductor substrate W is taken out in step S<b>8</b> and before step S<b>2</b> in which another semiconductor substrate W in process is mounted on the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Alternatively, the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> may be cooled in a period (step S<b>1</b>) after moving the lift pins <b>23</b> upward (step S<b>7</b>) to detach the semiconductor substrate W from the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and before starting transport of the semiconductor substrate W (step S<b>8</b>). In this way, step <b>8</b> and step <b>1</b> are carried out concurrently and processing time may therefore be shortened. In this case, it is preferable to clean the chamber <b>2</b> after the semiconductor substrate W is taken out of the chamber <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">According to the above-described embodiment, the temperature difference between the semiconductor substrate W to be accepted and the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is reduced by cooling the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> in advance in step S<b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, it may be possible to suppress expansion of the semiconductor substrate W attributed to the temperature difference, to reduce the number of particles generated by the semiconductor substrate W being rubbed with the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> in the course of expansion of the semiconductor substrate W, and to improve yield of the semiconductor devices as a consequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Moreover, in this method, the direct-current voltage V having the fixed value is constantly applied to the chuck electrodes <b>16</b> in step S<b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, the time for fixing the semiconductor substrate W to the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> may be made shorter as compared to the conventional example configured to provide the period in which the voltage applied to the chuck electrodes is set to 0 V for the purpose of suppressing generation of the particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Furthermore, the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is provided with a cooling mechanism which uses the coolant C, the helium gas He, and the like from the beginning. Accordingly, the temperature difference between the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> and the semiconductor substrate W may be reduced by using the cooling mechanism without modifying the apparatus. Thus, a mechanism for reducing the temperature difference does not have to be provided outside the chamber <b>2</b>. In addition, it may be also possible to prevent a drop in throughput which might have been incurred by use of such a mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Next, an investigation carried out for confirming an effect of the embodiment will be described.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">On the other hand, in the case of the second semiconductor substrate W, the temperature of the electrostatic chuck <b>3</b> is cooled down to the acceptance temperature T<sub>1 </sub>as in the embodiment at the time <b>0</b> when the semiconductor is fixed.</div>
