<h2>Description</h2>

<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">Electronic devices typically include one or more components that are formed from semiconductor wafers. The semiconductor wafers include a number of transistors, sometimes on the order of thousands of transistors up to billions of transistors, to accomplish the functions of the electronic devices. In some cases, electronic device designers often attempt to improve the performance of electronic devices and/or increase the functionality of electronic devices while reducing cost, by adding more transistors to semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Semiconductor device manufacturers have responded by continuing to decrease the size of the transistors formed on the semiconductor wafers. However, the extent of the decrease in size of the transistors may be limited due to limitations of processes used to form certain components of the transistor. For example, the decrease in size of the p-type or n-type junctions of a transistor may be limited due to the ability of semiconductor manufacturers to effectively dope semiconductor wafers such that the concentration of the dopant in the semiconductor wafer is uniform and at a shallow enough depth to support a smaller junction size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In particular, as the need for the depth of junctions of transistors to decrease below the 14 nm mark has increased and as transistors have been formed in three-dimensional shapes (e.g. finFETs), semiconductor manufacturers have encountered problems forming properly doped junctions and source/drain extensions, when using traditional doping methods, such as ion implantation. For example, ion implantation of dopants can damage the surface of the substrates, which affects the performance of the junction. Ion implantation may also suffer from limited lateral diffusion control resulting in greater short channel effects which decrease transistor performance. Additionally, since ion implantation is a line of sight doping technique, as the features of three-dimensional transistors decreases, the ion implantation devices are unable to access the entire surface of the substrate, which leads to a non-uniform doping of the substrate surface. When the junctions of transistors included in electronic devices are not uniformly doped, the performance of electronic devices including these transistors can decrease due to the inability of the transistors to signal discrete on and off states.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">This disclosure describes formulations of solutions and processes to form a substrate including a dopant. In particular implementations, the dopant may include arsenic (As). Substrates doped with arsenic may have improved electrical characteristics versus the electrical characteristics of phosphorous doped substrates. For example, the diffusion coefficient for As is significantly lower than the diffusion coefficient for other dopants, such as P. Thus, using As as a dopant may produce doped substrates with junctions that are shallower than doped substrates that include other n-type dopants. Additionally, using As as a dopant may produce a doped substrate that is able to withstand higher temperatures before diffusion of the dopant atoms occurs than substrates that include other n-type dopants. Accordingly, arsenic doped substrates can have improved performance with respect to substrates doped with phosphorous. In some cases, arsenic doped substrates can be used to produce semiconductor wafers that may be used in high performance electronic devices. Furthermore, this disclosure describes formulations and processes that may be used to form a uniformly doped substrate that may include three-dimensional transistor structures with junctions having depths less than 20 nm. In some cases, the substrates formed according to embodiments herein may include silicon-on-insulator substrates, germanium-on-insulator substrates, conventional silicon substrates, silicon substrates that may present multiple crystal orientations (e.g., substrates having a triangular shaped fin where the orientation of Si atoms may be a function of the position of the Si atoms on the three dimensional structure), conventional germanium substrates, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow diagram of a process <b>100</b> to form a substrate including an arsenic-containing dopant. In an embodiment, the substrate may be rigid, while in another embodiment, the substrate may be flexible. Additionally, the substrate may include a semiconducting material. For example, in one embodiment, the substrate may be a silicon containing substrate. In another embodiment, the substrate may be a germanium-containing substrate. In still another embodiment, the substrate may include a combination of silicon and germanium. In some cases, the substrate may include at least 40% silicon, at least 55% silicon, or at least 70% silicon. In other cases, substantially all of the substrate may include silicon, no greater than about 95% of the substrate may include silicon, or no greater than about 80% of the substrate may include silicon. In one non-limiting illustrative example, Si atoms of the substrate may have a <b>100</b> orientation. In another non-limiting illustrative example, Si atoms of the substrate may have a <b>111</b> orientation. In yet another non-limiting illustrative example, Si atoms of the substrate may have a <b>110</b> orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">At <b>102</b>, the process <b>100</b> includes preparing a solution that includes a solvent and a dopant. In some instances, the solution that includes the solvent and the dopant may be referred to herein as a “dopant solution.” In an embodiment, the dopant may include at least one arsenic atom. In one example, the dopant may include an arsenic-containing compound. The arsenic-containing compound may include an inorganic arsenic-containing compound, an organoarsenic compound, or an organic arsenic-containing compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In some cases, the arsenic-containing compound may include at least one functional group that is capable of reacting with atoms at the surface of a substrate and/or is capable of interacting with atoms at the surface of the substrate. The at least one functional group of the arsenic-containing compound may react and/or interact with atoms at the surface of the substrate via chemisorption, physisorption, or both. In particular embodiments, the reaction and/or interaction between the at least one functional group of the arsenic-containing compound and atoms at the surface of the substrate may include covalent bonding, dative bonding, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, or a combination thereof. In some situations, the arsenic-containing compounds and the atoms at the surface of the substrate may have a localized or supramolecular interaction that is sufficiently strong such that the arsenic-containing compound remains at the surface of the substrate when subjected to some subsequent processing conditions. In other instances, the reaction and/or interaction between the arsenic-containing compound and the atoms at the surface of the substrate may be disrupted when subjected to other subsequent processing conditions, such as the conditions of an annealing process. In this way, the arsenic atoms may be released and available to diffuse into the substrate.</div>

Additionally, in some embodiments, the arsenic-containing compounds may include one or more As(III) atoms. In other embodiments, the arsenic-containing compounds may include one or more As(V) atoms. In still other embodiments, the arsenic-containing compounds may include one or more As(III) atoms and one or more As(V) atoms. In some cases, the arsenic-containing compound may be a polyarsenic compound.</div>

Additionally, the surface of the substrate may be modified such that endgroups on the surface of the substrate are reactive toward the arsenic-containing compounds included in the dopant solution prepared with respect to operation <b>102</b>. In one illustrative example, the surface of the substrate may include a number of silicon atoms that are treated in such a way that silanols are formed followed by contacting the substrate with a solution that includes an ester-containing molecule. In another illustrative example, the surface of the substrate may be contacted with a nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In some instances, treating the surface of the substrate to produce a modified surface of the substrate may include one or more rinse cycles, one or more drying cycles, or a combination thereof.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">At <b>106</b>, the process <b>100</b> may include contacting the modified surface of the substrate with the dopant solution prepared with respect to operation <b>102</b>. Contacting the modified surface of the substrate with the dopant solution may cause a reaction between atoms of the modified surface of the substrate and the arsenic-containing molecules in the dopant solution. In this way, arsenic-containing compounds can be chemisorbed or physisorbed to atoms at the surface of the substrate. In particular, the arsenic-containing compounds may have a localized or supramolecular interaction that is sufficiently strong such that the arsenic-containing compound remains on the surface of the substrate when subjected to subsequent processing. In some cases, the interaction between the arsenic-containing compound and the atoms at the surface of the substrate may include covalent bonding, dative bonding, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, or a combination thereof. Particular examples of interactions between arsenic-containing compounds and atoms on the surface of the substrate may include hydrosilylation of alkenes and/or alkynes with surface silanes; ester interchange between ester moieties and surface silanols of other attached hydroxyls; carboxamide formation from an ester and amino functionalized surface; arsonous and/or asinous ester formation from surface silanols and amino arsines, such as trisdimethylaminoarsine; arsonous or arsinous ester formation from surface silanols and arsenic(III)-containing compounds, such as for example, arsenic-amine compounds with no more than 1 arsenic-nitrogen bond, no more than 2 arsenic-nitrogen bonds, or no more than 3 arsenic-nitrogen bonds; or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In one embodiment, the surface of the substrate can be contacted with the dopant solution for a duration of at least 0.05 hours, 0.3 hours, at least 0.9 hours, at least 1.4 hours, or at least 1.8 hours.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In some scenarios, the substrate may be rinsed after being contacted by the dopant solution. In one embodiment, the substrate may be rinsed with the solvent included in the dopant solution. In one illustrative example, the substrate may be rinsed with tetraglyme when tetraglyme is used to prepare the solution of <b>102</b>. In another illustrative example, the substrate can be rinsed with acetonitrile when acetonitrile is used to prepare the solution of <b>102</b>. In an additional illustrative example, the substrate can be rinsed with THF when THF is used to prepare the solution of <b>102</b>. In an additional illustrative example, the substrate can be rinsed with n-methylpyrolidone (NMP) when NMP is used to prepare the solution of <b>102</b>. In certain instances, the substrate may undergo an additional rinse after being rinsed with the solvent included in the dopant solution. In a non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the substrate may undergo an additional rinse using a low boiling point solvent. An example of a low boiling solvent may be isopropanol. In yet another illustrative example, the substrate can be rinsed with water. In certain cases, the substrate may also undergo one or more drying operations. In one case, the substrate may be dried after being contacted with the dopant solution. In another case, the substrate may be dried after being rinsed with the solvent of the dopant solution. In a further scenario, rinsing the substrate with the low-boiling point solvent may be part of a process to dry the substrate. In some cases, the substrate may not undergo rinsing after modifying the surface of the substrate and before contacting the substrate with a dopant solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In an embodiment, rinsing can include contacting the substrate with a heated solvent, such as the solvent included in the dopant solution. In a particular embodiment, the temperature of the solvent may be room temperatures, such as within a range of about 15° C. to about 25° C., up to a minimum temperature capable of initiating a reaction between the dopant solution and the substrate within a specified duration. In some cases, the heated solvent may be applied to a substrate after contacting the surface of the substrate with a surface modification solution or after the substrate has been contacted with a dopant solution. In one embodiment, after contacting the substrate with the heated solvent, the substrate may be rinsed with either water or a low boiling organic solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In another situation, rinsing the substrate can include contacting the substrate with a solvent and providing sonic energy into the liquid. In some instances, the sonic energy may be ultrasonic or megasonic. In one embodiment, the sonic energy may be provided to the solvent for a duration of at least 10 seconds, at least 30 seconds, at least 2 minutes or at least 5 minutes. In a particular embodiment, the sonic energy may be provided continuously or in a pulsed manner, and the frequency may be fixed, swept, or any combination thereof. In a further embodiment, the solvent provided with the sonic energy may be the solvent present in the dopant solution, another organic solvent, such as a low boiling organic solvent, or de-ionized water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In a particular illustrative embodiment, the processes described with respect to operation <b>106</b> can be repeated. To illustrate, after the substrate is contacted with the dopant solution, the substrate may undergo an additional process to contact the substrate with the dopant solution. In some situations, the substrate may be rinsed each time the substrate is contacted with a dopant solution, while in other cases, the substrate may not be rinsed after at least one of the applications of the dopant solution to the substrate. Accordingly, multiple layers of the arsenic-containing compound in the dopant solution may be added to the surface of the substrate. In some instances, the duration and temperature of subsequent operations of contacting the substrate with the dopant solution may be similar to the duration and temperature of a previous operation of contacting the substrate and the dopant solution. In other instances, the duration and temperature of subsequent operations directed to contacting the substrate with the dopant solution may be different than the duration and temperature of a previous operation of contacting the substrate with the dopant solution. Accordingly, the use of more than one dopant solution for the corresponding dopant layers may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">At <b>108</b>, the process <b>100</b> includes adding the dopant to a body of the substrate. In some cases, the dopant may be added to the body of the substrate via diffusion. In particular instances, arsenic atoms included in the arsenic-containing compounds bonded to the surface of the substrate may diffuse from the surface of the substrate into the body of the substrate under suitable conditions. In some cases, the arsenic-containing compounds bonded to the surface of the substrate may be organoarsenic compounds. In other situations, the arsenic-containing compounds bonded to the surface of the substrate may be inorganic. In a particular instance, organic functional groups of an organoarsenic compound that is bonded to atoms at the surface of the substrate may react with trace amounts of water to cleave the organic functional groups and produce an inorganic arsenic-containing compound. For example, when tris(dimethylamino)arsine (TDMA) is bonded to silanol groups at the surface of the substrate, trace amounts of water may react with the dimethylamine groups of TDMA to remove these organic functional groups. In an illustrative embodiment, arsenic atoms diffusing into the body of the substrate may displace silicon atoms, germanium atoms, or both, within the lattice structure of the body of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In particular embodiments, the arsenic atoms may diffuse to a particular depth with respect to the surface of the substrate. In one example, the arsenic atoms may diffuse into the body of the substrate such that the peak concentration of the dopant is achieved at a depth of no greater than about 20 nm from the surface of the substrate, no greater than about 10 nm from the surface of the substrate, no greater than about 7 nm from the surface of the substrate, or no greater than about 4 nm from the surface of the substrate. Additionally, the distribution of dopant in the substrate may be such that substantially no dopant in the silicon is present at a distance of 20 nm from a location of the peak dopant concentration in the substrate, at a distance of 10 nm from a location of a peak dopant concentration in the substrate, at a distance of 7 nm from a location of the peak dopant concentration in the substrate, or at a distance of 5 nm from the a location of the peak dopant concentration in the substrate. In an illustrative embodiment, the arsenic atoms may diffuse into the body of the substrate such that a location of the peak concentration of arsenic is achieved at a depth within a range of about 0.5 nm to about 9 nm and substantially no arsenic is present at a depth of about 3 nm to about 10 nm from a location of the peak arsenic concentration. In another illustrative embodiment, the arsenic atoms may diffuse into the body of the substrate to a depth within a range of about 1 nm to about 5 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In an embodiment, adding the dopant to the body of the substrate may include an anneal process. In some cases, the anneal process may be conducted in an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, environment. In one embodiment, the anneal process may have a duration of at least 10 milliseconds, at least 0.5 seconds, at least 4 seconds, at least 20 seconds, at least 30 seconds, or at least 45 seconds. In another embodiment, the anneal process may have a duration of no greater than 135 seconds, no greater than 100 seconds, no greater than 75 seconds, or no greater than 50 seconds. In an illustrative embodiment, the anneal process can have a duration within a range of about 10 seconds to about 90 seconds, within a range of about 25 seconds to about 75 seconds, or within a range of about 30 seconds to about 60 seconds. In another illustrative embodiment, the anneal process may have a duration within a range of about 10 milliseconds to about 700 milliseconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">In an additional embodiment, the anneal process may be conducted at a temperature of at least 600° C., at least 750° C., at least 900° C., or at least 1000° C. In a further embodiment, the anneal process may be conducted at a temperature of no greater than about 1200° C., no greater than about 1125° C., or no greater than about 1050° C. In an illustrative embodiment, the anneal process may be conducted at a temperature within a range of about 800° C. to about 1150° C. or within a range of about 900° C. to about 1050° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In some cases, prior to the annealing operation, a capping layer may be applied to the surface of the substrate. The capping layer may overlie the arsenic-containing compounds bonded to atoms of the substrate. In one embodiment, the capping layer may include SiO<sub>2</sub>. In another embodiment, the capping layer can include silicon oxide formed using a plasma enhanced tetraethyl-orthosilicate process. In another embodiment, the capping layer can include silicon oxide formed with a liquid spin-on dielectric material. In some cases, the capping layer may have a thickness of at least 10 nm, at least 25 nm, or at least 40 nm. In other situations, the capping layer may have a thickness no greater than about 100 nm, no greater than about 80 nm, or no greater than about 60 nm. In an illustrative embodiment, the capping layer may have a thickness within a range of about 15 nm to about 55 nm or within a range of about 25 nm to about 45 nm. In a particular embodiment, after annealing of the substrate, the capping layer may be removed. For example, the capping layer may be removed by contacting the capping layer with a solution of dilute hydrofluoric acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Although the process <b>100</b> includes operations described with respect to blocks <b>102</b>-<b>108</b>, in some cases, the process <b>100</b> can include additional operations. To illustrate, once the dopant has been added to the substrate, one or more additional operations can be performed to form a semiconductor device that includes ultra-shallow junctions formed from the doped substrate. In another illustration, the substrate may be contacted with a material that blocks some silicon atoms at the surface of the substrate from forming a bond with the arsenic-containing compound.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Substrates formed according to embodiments herein may have certain advantages over the state of the art. In particular, substrates formed according to embodiments described herein may have a more uniform distribution of dopant atoms than the distribution provided by conventional processes, such as ion implantation.

Furthermore, the depth of the diffusion of the dopant atoms can be controlled such that semiconductor devices with ultra-shallow junctions less than 14 nm can be formed.

The mixture is stirred at room temperature, with perhaps a very, very mild exothermic reaction upon addition/dissolution of the acid chloride. Upon complete dissolution in about 5 min, about 1-3 mL of water is added dropwise and the product precipitates as a colorless powder. The precipitate is removed by suction filtration and dried on the filter for about 16 hours to yield about 3.96 g of the product. Two more crops of about 0.9 g and about 1.1 g of the product are recovered. A 1HNMR analysis indicates that the additional crops have a small amount of contamination of p-arsinilic acid.

The mixture is heated to reflux under nitrogen for about 1.5 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Removal of the solvent in vacuum gives crude N,N,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxarsinan-2-amine as an oil.
