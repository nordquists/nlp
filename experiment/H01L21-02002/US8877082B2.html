<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a processing method, more particularly; to a processing method which is capable of processing highly efficiently and accurately a surface of a high-performance material difficult in processing such as SiC (silicon carbide) and GaN (gallium nitride).</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">In recent years, as materials for next-generation power semi-conductor devices, attention has been given to materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), diamond, sapphire and aluminum nitride (AlN) which are wide bandgap semiconductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">For example, silicon carbide (SiC) has excellent physical values, that is, three times greater in bandgap and about seven times greater in dielectric breakdown electric-field strength than a Si semiconductor. As compared with presently available Si power devices, it is excellent in terms of low loss, high-frequency characteristics and high-temperature operability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">However, SiC is high in hardness which is next to diamond and quite stable thermally and chemically, which makes it difficult to process SiC. Thus, it is difficult to apply conventional silicon processing technologies as these are.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">It is noted that conventional technologies for processing a SiC substrate include CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) and high-temperature hydrogen anneal in which a substrate cut out from a single crystal of SiC is mechanically polished by using diamond grind particles to make a surface flat and an altered layer on the surface due to the processing is subsequently removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, in the above-described technologies for processing a SiC substrate, a finishing surface is slightly damaged, which makes it difficult to provide a sufficient surface as a substrate for epitaxial growth. It has been, therefore, strongly demanded to develop a processing technology which is capable of providing efficiently a damage-free surface of a SiC substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In accordance with the demand; there has been proposed a processing method in which a work piece is arranged in an oxidizing agent solution and constrained on a surface plate or a processing head by way of a magnetic field, magnetic fine particles of a transition metal which are spatially controlled are brought into contact with a to-be-processed surface of a work piece under extremely low loads, the to-be-processed surface and the magnetic fine particles are subjected to relative displacement, and compounds generated by chemical reactions of oxidizing active-species generated on surfaces of the magnetic fine particles with atoms on the surface of the work piece are removed or eluted through catalysis of the magnetic fine particles, by which the work piece is processed (refer to Patent Document 1, for example).</div>

<heading>Patent Document</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Patent Document 1: Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2008-71857</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, the technology described in Patent Document 1 does not provide a sufficient processing rate, and another improvement in processing rate has been demanded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The present invention has been made in view of the above situation of an object thereof is to provide a processing method capable of achieving a high processing rate.</div>
<heading>Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In order to achieve the above object, the processing method of the present invention includes a step in which on a surface of a work piece arranged in an alkaline solution, light having energy greater than a bandgap of the work piece is irradiated, and also in a state that a processing member is kept in contact with the surface of the work piece on which the light has been irradiated, the work piece and the processing member are subjected to relative displacement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">In this instance, the light having energy greater than the bandgap of the work piece is irradiated to excite the surface of the work piece, thus making it possible to induce oxidation/reduction reactions on the surface of the work piece. Then, oxidation/reduction reactions rake place on the surface of the work piece, by which the surface of the work piece can be modified to form a layer softer than a base material. For example, where the work piece is a SiC substrate, a SiOx layer can be formed as a layer softer than the work piece. Where the work piece is a GaN substrate, a Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer can be formed as a soft layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Furthermore, a work piece is arranged in an alkaline solution, thus making it possible to chemically remove a soft layer formed oil the surface of the work piece. Still furthermore, in a state that a processing member is kept in contact with the surface of the work, piece, the work piece and the processing member are subjected to relative displacement, by which the soft layer formed on the surface of the work piece can be removed mechanically (physically).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">That is, the soft layer formed on the surface of the work piece is, (1) chemically removed by an alkaline solution, or (2) mechanically removed by using a processing member, or (3) chemically removed by an alkaline solution and also mechanically removed by using a processing member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Where light to be irradiated at a work piece is irradiated directly above or directly below the work piece, the light is to be irradiated evenly at the work piece. Therefore, a soft layer formed on the surface of the work piece is also formed evenly, thus making it possible to improve surface roughness at a processed area and provide a smoother processed surface.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Hereinafter, an explanation will be made for modes (hereinafter, referred to as embodiments) for carrying out the present invention. The explanation will be made by the following order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">1. First embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">2. Second embodiment</div>
<heading>1. First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram which explains a processing unit for carrying out one example of a processing method to which the present invention is applied. The processing unit (polishing unit) <b>1</b> given here includes a processing tank <b>3</b> which contains a potassium hydroxide solution (0.1 mol/liter) <b>2</b>, a sample holder <b>4</b> which holds a SiC substrate <b>8</b>, and an ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> which irradiates ultraviolet light. The SiC substrate is one example of a work piece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">A bottom <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the processing tank <b>3</b> is composed of a synthetic quartz, surface plate, and the work piece is to be polished on an upper face (upper face in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the synthetic quartz surface plate. Furthermore, a side wall <b>3</b> <i>b </i>of the processing tank <b>3</b> is formed with a resin material excellent in drug resistance, for example, a fluororesin or a polyvinyl chloride resin. It is noted that the synthetic quartz surface plate is one example of a processing member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Here, in the present embodiment, an explanation is made for a case where the bottom <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the processing tank <b>3</b> is formed with synthetic quartz, for example. However, any material will be sufficient which has such, transmittance that ultraviolet light to be irradiated from the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> arrives at the upper face of the bottom <b>3</b> <i>a</i>. And, the bottom <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is not necessarily formed with synthetic quartz but may be formed with, for example, sapphire or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Furthermore, the center of the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is coupled with a rotating shaft <b>7</b> <i>a </i>which is connected to a motor <b>6</b>. The processing tank <b>3</b> is constituted so as to rotate by the motor <b>6</b> in a direction indicated with symbol A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Here, in the present embodiment, an explanation is made for a case where, as an alkaline solution to be contained in the processing tank <b>3</b>, used is a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. However, as will be described later, any alkaline solution will, be sufficient as long as it is capable of removing chemically a modified layer portion formed on a surface of a work piece. And, the alkaline solution is not necessarily a potassium hydroxide solution but may be that which contains at least one of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, a sodium hydroxide (NaOK) solution, an alkaline electrolyte and a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) solution. That is, the alkaline solution may be replaced with various materials depending on a combination of a work piece, processing conditions, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Furthermore, the sample holder <b>4</b> is constituted so as to rotate in a direction indicated by symbol B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at the center of a rotating shaft <b>7</b> <i>b </i>which is made eccentric to the rotating shaft <b>7</b> <i>a </i>of the processing tank <b>3</b>. The sample holder <b>4</b> comes down from above to a position at which the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other, with the SiC substrate <b>8</b> being held.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Here, in the present embodiment, an explanation is made for a case where the SiC substrate <b>6</b> is taken as a work piece held with the sample holder <b>4</b>. However, the work piece shall not be limited to the SiC substrate but may include a substrate composed of, for example, silicon nitride, GaN, diamond, sapphire or AlN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Furthermore, the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> is constituted so as to irradiate ultraviolet light on the upper face of the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a</i>. That is, it is constituted so that ultraviolet light can be irradiated at an area where the SiC substrate <b>6</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other. It is noted that the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> is arranged directly below the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quarts surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact, with each other and constituted so as to irradiate ultraviolet light directly above from the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Here, as long as ultraviolet light can be irradiated at the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quarts surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other, the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> is not necessarily arranged directly below the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other. However, the ultraviolet light source Sis arranged directly below the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other in such a mariner that the ultraviolet light can be irradiated directly above. Thereby, it is possible to irradiate the ultraviolet light evenly at the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other. Therefore, it is preferable that the ultraviolet light source <b>5</b> is arranged directly below the area where the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In the present embodiment, an explanation is made for a case where light irradiated at the SiC substrate <b>8</b> is ultraviolet light. However, any light will be sufficient as long as it has energy greater than a bandgap of the SiC substrate <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Hereinafter, an explanation will be made for a processing method in which the above-constituted processing unit <b>1</b> is used. That is, there will be explained one example of the processing method to which the present invention is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">First, ultraviolet light is irradiated at the SiC substrate <b>8</b>, by which, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, a layer <b>9</b> is formed which is softer than the SiC substrate <b>8</b>. More specifically, the ultraviolet light is irradiated at the SiC substrate <b>8</b> to form the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>9</b> on a surface layer of the SiC substrate <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">That is, the ultraviolet light is irradiated at the SiC substrate <b>8</b>, by which a surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b> is excited to induce oxidation/reduction reactions on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b>. Then, oxidation/reduction reactions take place on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b>, by which the surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b> is modified. As described, above, the soft layer (SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer) <b>9</b> is formed on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>9</b> formed on the surface layer of the SiC substrate <b>8</b> is removed by chemical etching actions resulting from a potassium hydroxide solution (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>) and also mechanically removed by the synthetic quartz surface plate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>(refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(C)</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In the processing method of the present embodiment, the soft SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>9</b> is formed on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>8</b> and removed chemically and mechanically. It is, thereby, possible to achieve highly efficient and highly accurate processing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">That is, symbol A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates a processing rate at which the surface of the SiC substrate is oxidized by OH radical (OH; hydroxyl radical) generated, through reactions of the processing member (Fe) with the hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen dissolved in the hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to form a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer and the processing member is then moved in a reciprocating manner, thereby removing the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer. This technology has been described in Patent Document 1 described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Furthermore, symbol B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates a processing rate at which the SiC substrate is arranged in hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), ultraviolet light is irradiated at the SiC substrate, and quartz is kept in contact with the SiC substrate and moved in a reciprocating manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">That is, symbol B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates a processing rate at which the surface of the SiC substrate is oxidized by OH radical generated through decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) due to influences of the ultraviolet light and oxygen dissolved in the hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to forma SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer and the quartz is then moved in a reciprocating manner, thereby removing the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">On the other hand, symbol C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates a processing rate by the processing method of the present embodiment.</div>
