<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein generally relate to systems and methods for fabricating semiconductor device structures and more particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to systems and methods for fabricating semiconductor devices wherein the systems and methods determine measurements of physical features, dimensions, or other attributes of semiconductor device structures using measurements obtained from different metrology tools in combination with available data and/or information pertaining to the fabrication of those features, dimensions, or other attributes of the semiconductor device structure.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Semiconductor devices, such as transistors, are the core building block of the vast majority of electronic devices. In practice, it is desirable to accurately and precisely fabricate transistors and other semiconductor devices with physical features having specific physical dimensions to thereby achieve semiconductor devices having their intended performance characteristics and to improve yield. However, the hardware tools used to fabricate the devices may exhibit performance variations. As a result, devices may be fabricated with features that deviate from their specified physical dimensions, which, in turn, could lead to failures at wafer test and, accordingly, reduce yield. Thus, it is desirable to measure physical features, critical dimensions and/or other properties of devices during fabrication to correct any deviations from the intended physical dimensions and thereby reduce the likelihood of failures at wafer test and improve yield. However, obtaining highly accurate measurements typically takes an undesirably long amount of time or involves destructive metrologies that reduce yield. At the same time, non-destructive measurement tools may be limited in their ability to accurately measure all of the physical features, critical dimensions, and profile information of a device, which, in turn, limits the ability of a foundry (or fab) to maximize yield.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the application and uses of such embodiments. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate to methods and systems for fabricating semiconductor device structures that involve determining process-enhanced hybrid (or composite) measurements of attributes of semiconductor device structures using measurements obtained from different metrology tools along with process information obtained from one or more processing tools, process control systems, factory control systems, or the like. In this regard, the process information is used to adjust, modify, or otherwise influence feature measurements obtained using metrology tools (or the manner in which those feature measurements obtained using metrology tools are combined) to achieve adjusted feature measurements that are more accurate and/or reliable than an individual feature measurement obtained using an individual metrology tool. Relative to hybrid measurements calculated using measurements obtained from metrology tools, process-enhanced hybrid metrology accounts for additional information or data describing or otherwise quantifying the actual fabrication processes to which a wafer was exposed or otherwise subject to during fabrication of the semiconductor device structure (or the features thereof) along with information or data describing or otherwise quantifying the particular processing tool(s) used for those fabrication processes to provide more accurate and reliable feature measurements while also reducing metrology costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Depending on the embodiment, an attribute being measured may be a physical feature, structure or dimension, an absence of a physical feature or structure (e.g., a recess, void or the like), or an intrinsic property (e.g., ion concentration, index of refraction, bulk modulus, electron mobility, or other compositional and/or optical properties). Thus, although the subject matter may be described herein in the context of measuring physical features and/or dimensions of semiconductor device structures, it should be understood that the subject matter is not limited to physical features and/or dimensions and may be utilized to obtain process-enhanced hybrid measurements of intrinsic properties or other attributes of a semiconductor device structure and/or wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Hybrid Metrology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a hybrid measurement may be calculated using measurements obtained from more than one metrology tool to provide a composite measurement of a particular attribute. For example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, each metrology tool determines measurements of one or more physical features and/or dimensions of a semiconductor device structure based on measurement data measured or otherwise obtained using measurement hardware associated with that metrology tool. The measurements obtained from the different metrology tools are weighted based on their relative accuracy and/or reliability or other characteristics of their respective metrology tool to provide a composite measurement with an accuracy and/or reliability that is greater than the accuracy and/or reliability of the individual measurements obtained by the individual metrology tools.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a measurement system <b>100</b> includes, without limitation, a plurality of metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> communicatively coupled to a host computing device <b>106</b> over a communications network <b>108</b>, such as a computer network (e.g., a wide area network, a wireless local area network, or the like), a cellular network, an ad-hoc or peer-to-peer network, or the like.

In this regard, a hybrid measurement is calculated or otherwise determined based on different measurements from different metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and other factors in a manner that achieves a composite measurement for a particular physical feature and/or critical dimension of the device structure(s) on the wafer <b>110</b> that is more accurate and/or reliable than an individual measurement for that feature and/or dimension from an individual metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.

In this regard, each metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may use a different measurement technique than the other metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in the measurement system <b>100</b>. In exemplary embodiments, each metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> utilizes a non-destructive measurement technique (or technology) so that the wafer <b>110</b> is still suitable for its intended operation after being measured. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the host computing device <b>106</b> communicates with the metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to signal, command, or otherwise indicate, to a respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, which features on the wafer <b>110</b> are to be measured by that respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> along with additional information pertaining to how that respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> should perform the measurement. After a respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> finishes measuring the physical feature(s) on the wafer <b>110</b>, the metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may provide the feature measurements to the host computing device <b>106</b> and/or another metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.

For purposes of explanation, in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the metrology tool <b>102</b> which obtains the feature measurements from the other metrology tools <b>104</b> and determines final hybrid measurements may be alternatively referred to as the primary metrology tool, while the remaining metrology tool(s) <b>104</b> in the measurement system <b>100</b> may be alternatively referred to as the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b>. As described in greater detail below, a secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> may also obtain a hybrid measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and potentially other feature measurements from other secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b> to adjust the feature measurements obtained by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>. Thus, the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b> may also determine hybrid (or composite) measurements.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and with continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> involves obtaining measurements for one or more physical features, dimensions and/or other attributes on a wafer from one or more secondary metrology tool(s) (task <b>302</b>). For example, after the physical features and/or dimensions to be measured have been fabricated, the wafer <b>110</b> is placed in a chamber proximate to or otherwise associated with a secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> such that the wafer <b>110</b> is aligned with the measurement arrangement <b>204</b> of the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> notifies the host computing device <b>106</b> of the presence of the wafer <b>110</b>, wherein the host computing device <b>106</b> provides commands and/or instructions to the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> to initiate measurement of the semiconductor device structures on the wafer <b>110</b>. In response to receiving commands and/or instructions from the host computing device <b>106</b>, the processing module <b>206</b> of the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> signals or otherwise operates the measurement arrangement <b>204</b> to measure the physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b> in the manner indicated by the host computing device <b>106</b>. As described above, in accordance with one or more embodiments, to measure physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b>, the measurement arrangement <b>204</b> transmits or otherwise directs a reference signal towards the wafer <b>110</b>, wherein the physical features of the wafer <b>110</b> modulate or otherwise influence the reference signal resulting in a response signal that is sensed or otherwise received by the measurement arrangement <b>204</b>. The processing module <b>206</b> receives or otherwise obtains the raw feature measurement data from the measurement arrangement <b>204</b>, calculates or otherwise determines measurements for the corresponding physical features and/or critical dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b> based on characteristics of the response signal (e.g., the response signal spectra, waveforms, or the like), and stores or otherwise maintains the feature measurements in memory <b>208</b>. The secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> communicates or otherwise provides the obtained feature measurements to the host computing device <b>106</b> and/or the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> for use in determining hybrid measurements for physical features and/or critical dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b>, as described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> also obtains measurements for one or more physical features, dimensions and/or other attributes on a wafer from the primary metrology tool (task <b>304</b>). In a similar manner as described above, the wafer <b>110</b> is placed in a chamber proximate to or otherwise associated with a primary metrology tool <b>102</b> such that the wafer <b>110</b> is aligned with the measurement arrangement <b>204</b> of the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, and the host computing device <b>106</b> provides commands and/or instructions to the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> regarding which physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b> should be measured. In response to receiving commands and/or instructions from the host computing device <b>106</b>, the processing module <b>206</b> of the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> signals or otherwise operates the measurement arrangement <b>204</b> to measure the physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b> in the manner indicated by the host computing device <b>106</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> continues by calculating or otherwise determining hybrid measurements for one or more physical features, dimensions and/or other attributes of the wafer based on the feature measurements obtained using the secondary metrology tool(s) and the feature measurements obtained using the primary metrology tool (task <b>306</b>). In an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid feature measurements for a particular feature and/or dimension are calculated as a function of the measurement for that feature and/or dimension obtained using the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and one or more feature measurements from one or more secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b>. The secondary metrology tool feature measurement(s) used in determining a hybrid measurement for a feature may be for that feature or a different feature on the wafer <b>110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and/or the host computing device <b>106</b> determines the hybrid measurement for a particular feature and/or dimension by weighting the primary metrology tool feature measurement and the secondary metrology tool feature measurement(s) in accordance with their relative accuracy and/or reliability. For example, as described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for each respective secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, the metrology tool <b>102</b> and/or the host computing device <b>106</b> may determine a weighting factor representative of the relative quality of feature measurements from that secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> with respect to the metrology tool <b>102</b> and/or the other secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> in the measurement system <b>100</b>. In this regard, the quality weighting factor for a particular metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be based on or influenced by the total measurement uncertainty (TMU) and/or reference measurement system uncertainty (RMSU) of the respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> along with other characteristics of the respective metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> that may influence measurement quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In accordance with one embodiment, the metrology tool <b>102</b> and/or the host computing device <b>106</b> calculates the hybrid measurement for a particular feature on the wafer <b>110</b> as a weighted sum of the feature measurements from the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b> and the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> using the quality weighting factors. For example, for a particular critical dimension measured by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and a secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may calculate a hybrid measurement of a critical dimension (CD) using the equation CD<sub>H</sub>=γ<sub>S1</sub>CD<sub>S</sub>+γ<sub>P1</sub>CD<sub>P</sub>, where CD<sub>S </sub>is the measurement for the critical dimension that was determined or otherwise measured by the secondary tool <b>104</b>, CD<sub>P </sub>is the measurement for the critical dimension that was determined or otherwise measured by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, γ<sub>S1 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, and γ<sub>P1 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the sum of the quality weighting factors is equal to one, where γ<sub>P1</sub>=1−γ<sub>S1</sub>, such that the quality weighting factor associated with the primary metrology tool corresponds to and compensates for the relative difference between the secondary tool feature measurement (e.g., CD<sub>S</sub>) and the weighted secondary tool feature measurement (e.g., γ<sub>S1</sub>CD<sub>S</sub>). As described above, in some embodiments, the secondary tool feature measurement may be for a different physical feature and/or dimension than the primary tool feature measurement. For example, the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> may be realized as an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tool that measures a sidewall angle of a gate structure fabricated on the wafer <b>110</b> and the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> may be realized as an optical critical dimension (OCD) tool that measures a gate dielectric undercut and determines a hybrid measurement for the gate dielectric undercut based on its own measurement of the gate dielectric undercut and the measurement of the gate sidewall angle obtained from the AFM metrology tool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> continues by identifying or otherwise determining whether a desired number of iterations have been performed, and when the desired number of iterations have not been performed, providing the hybrid measurement(s) to one or more of the secondary metrology tool(s) for adjusting the feature measurements obtained by the respective secondary metrology tool (tasks <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>). For example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, after the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> calculates hybrid measurements using the feature measurements measured by the metrology tool <b>102</b> and feature measurements measured by the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b>, the metrology tool <b>102</b> provides the hybrid measurements for the physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b> to the host computing device <b>106</b>. When the host computing device <b>106</b> determines that a desired number of iterations have not been performed, the host computing device <b>106</b> either transmits the hybrid measurements obtained from the metrology tool <b>102</b> to one or more of the secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> or the host computing device <b>106</b> signals the metrology tool <b>102</b> to transmit the hybrid measurement to the one or more secondary metrology tools <b>104</b>. After the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> obtains the hybrid measurement for a particular physical feature and/or dimension from the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> calculates or otherwise determines an adjusted measurement for a particular physical feature and/or dimension (which may or may not be the same feature corresponding to the hybrid measurement) using the hybrid measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and the previous feature measurement measured by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> (e.g., the feature measurement previously calculated using the raw feature measurement data obtained using its measurement arrangement <b>204</b>). In this regard, in a similar manner as described above, the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> may determine quality weighting factors and calculate the adjusted feature measurement as a weighted sum of the hybrid feature measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and the feature measurement obtained using its own measurement hardware. Thus, the hybrid measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> is utilized to augment or otherwise modify the feature measurements determined by the secondary tool <b>104</b>. For example, the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> may calculate an adjusted measurement of the critical dimension (CD) using the equation CD<sub>S</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>ADJ</sub>=γ<sub>S2</sub>CD<sub>S</sub>+γ<sub>P2</sub>CD<sub>H</sub>, where CD<sub>S </sub>is the previous measurement for the critical dimension determined by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, CD<sub>H </sub>is the hybrid measurement for the critical dimension that was determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, γ<sub>S2 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> determined by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, and γ<sub>P2 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> determined by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>. In this regard, the adjusted secondary metrology tool feature measurement is also a hybrid (or composite) feature measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">After a secondary metrology tool determines an adjusted feature measurement, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> repeats the step of determining a hybrid measurement for that physical feature and/or dimension based on the adjusted feature measurements determined by the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b> (task <b>306</b>). In this regard, the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> obtains an adjusted feature measurement from a secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> and calculates an adjusted hybrid feature measurement as a function of the adjusted feature measurement and the previous feature measurement determined by the metrology tool <b>102</b>. In one or more embodiments, the metrology tool <b>102</b> calculates the adjusted hybrid measurement as a weighted sum of the previous feature measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> and the adjusted feature measurement determined by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>. For example, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may calculate an adjusted hybrid measurement of a critical dimension (CD) using the equation CD<sub>H</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>ADJ</sub>=γ<sub>S1</sub>CD<sub>S</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>ADJ</sub>+γ<sub>P1</sub>CD<sub>P</sub>, where CD<sub>S</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>ADJ </sub>is the adjusted measurement for the critical dimension determined by the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, CD<sub>P </sub>is the measurement for the critical dimension that was obtained using the measurement hardware of the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>. In this manner, the adjusted secondary metrology tool feature measurement augments or otherwise modifies the hybrid measurement determined by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In an exemplary embodiment, the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> repeats the steps of iteratively adjusting the secondary metrology tool measurements and determining updated hybrid feature measurements until a desired number of iterations have been performed (tasks <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>). In this regard, the desired number of iterations to be performed is chosen to achieve final hybrid feature measurements having a desired level of accuracy and/or reliability. For example, in one or more embodiments, the metrology tool <b>102</b> provides the hybrid feature measurements determined at the end of each iteration to the host computing device <b>106</b>. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, the host computing device <b>106</b> determines that the desired number iterations have been performed when the difference between successive hybrid feature measurements provided by the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> is less than a threshold amount. For example, when a hybrid feature measurement determined by the metrology tool <b>102</b> differs from the previous hybrid feature measurement provided by the metrology tool <b>102</b> by less than a threshold amount (e.g., a percentage of the previous hybrid feature measurement or a fixed amount), the host computing device <b>106</b> commands, signals, or otherwise indicates to the metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> that the desired number of iterations have been performed. In other embodiments, the host computing device <b>106</b> counts or otherwise monitors the number of iterations performed by the metrology tool <b>102</b> and commands, signals, or otherwise indicates to the metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> that the desired number of iterations have been performed when the counted number of iterations exceeds a threshold number chosen to result in hybrid measurements with a desired accuracy and/or reliability.

In this regard, the processing module <b>116</b> stores the final hybrid measurements obtained from the metrology tool <b>102</b> in memory <b>118</b>, and when a user subsequently accesses the host computing device <b>106</b> to view measurements for the physical features and/or dimensions on the wafer <b>110</b>, the processing module <b>116</b> presents or otherwise displays the final hybrid measurements (or a graphical representation thereof) on the display device <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an exemplary weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> suitable for implementation by a measurement system <b>100</b> in connection with the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to determine quality weighting factors. The various tasks performed in connection with the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description refers to elements mentioned above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. In practice, portions of the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> may be performed by different elements of the measurement system <b>100</b>, such as, for example, the primary metrology tool <b>102</b>, the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>104</b>, and/or the host computing device <b>106</b>. It should be appreciated that the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks need not be performed in the illustrated order and/or the tasks may be performed concurrently, and/or the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown and described in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> could be omitted from a practical embodiment of the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In an exemplary embodiment, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> begins by determining or otherwise identifying the number of different feature measurements from different metrology tools to be utilized by a particular tool in determining a hybrid measurement (task <b>402</b>). For example, the primary metrology tool <b>102</b> may identify the total number of secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> in the system as the number of different feature measurements to be utilized by the metrology tool <b>102</b> when determining hybrid measurements. After identifying the number of different feature measurements to be utilized, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> continues by determining initial quality weighting factors for each respective feature measurement based on correlation metrics for the respective feature measurement and/or characteristics of the metrology tool associated with the respective feature measurement (task <b>404</b>). In accordance with one embodiment, the metrology tool <b>102</b> determines a numerical range for the quality weighting factors, and then determines, for each respective feature measurement, an initial quality weighting factor value based on one or more correlation metrics (e.g., TMU, RMSU, R<sup>2 </sup>values or other correlation coefficients, and the like) associated with that feature measurement and/or one or more characteristics of the secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> (e.g., FMP or other tool matching metrics, the precision of the tool, the throughput of the tool, the configuration and/or type of tool, the age of the tool, performance characteristics of the measurement arrangement, and the like) providing that feature measurement that are likely to impact the reliability of that feature measurement. In other words, each quality weighting factor is determined as a function of one or more correlation metrics and/or one or more characteristics of the respective metrology tool providing that feature measurement to reduce or otherwise eliminate measurement noise and thereby improve the metrology performance of the hybrid measurement using that feature measurement. The initial quality weighting factor associated with a feature measurement provided by a first secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> may be greater than the initial quality weighting factor associated with a feature measurement provided by a second secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> when the correlation metric(s) and/or tool characteristic(s) of the first secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> are indicative of the measurements from the first secondary metrology tool <b>104</b> being more accurate than measurements from the second secondary metrology tool <b>104</b>, and vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, after determining initial quality weighting factors for the different measurements, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> continues by determining an initial hybrid measurement as a function of the initial quality weighting factors and different measurements from the different metrology tools (task <b>406</b>). For example, the metrology tool <b>102</b> determines an initial hybrid measurement for a physical feature and/or dimension as a function of the measurement for that feature and/or dimension obtained using the metrology tool <b>102</b>, the quality weighting factor associated with the metrology tool <b>102</b>, one or more additional measurements obtained from one or more of the secondary metrology tools <b>104</b>, and the initial quality weighting factors associated with those one or more additional measurements and/or secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> in a similar manner as described above. After determining an initial hybrid measurement, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> continues by iteratively adjusting the quality weighting factors to reduce the uncertainty of the hybrid measurement by reducing the difference between the hybrid measurement and a reference measurement (task <b>408</b>). In this regard, the equation and/or function used to calculate a hybrid measurement is optimized by adjusting the different weighting factors used to calculate the hybrid measurement. For example, in accordance with one embodiment, a reference measurement for the physical feature and/or dimension may be obtained using a highly accurate metrology, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using the reference measurement, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may iteratively adjust one or more of the quality weighting factors associated with one or more of the measurements obtained from the secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> to reduce or eliminate the difference between the hybrid measurement calculated by the metrology tool <b>102</b> and the reference measurement. In this regard, in some embodiments, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may modify any equations and/or functions used to determine the initial quality weighting factors so that those equations and/or functions provide different quality weighting factor values that reduce the difference (or error) between the hybrid measurement and the reference measurement. In other embodiments, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may determine the hybrid measurement multiple times using different feature measurement values obtained using the metrology tools <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> (e.g., by measuring the same wafer and/or semiconductor devices multiple times), wherein the metrology tool <b>102</b> iteratively adjusts the quality weighting factors to reduce or eliminate the difference between the different hybrid measurements calculated by the metrology tool <b>102</b>. In other words, the metrology tool <b>102</b> quality weighting factors are iteratively adjusted so that the different hybrid measurements converge to reduce the difference between the different hybrid measurements until the difference between the different hybrid measurements is below a threshold amount. In this regard, a previous and/or subsequent hybrid measurement functions as a reference measurement when adjusting the quality weighting factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">After iteratively adjusting the quality weighting factors to optimize the hybrid measurement calculation, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> continues by maintaining the final quality weighting factors for use in subsequent hybrid measurement determinations (task <b>410</b>). In an exemplary embodiment, the metrology tool <b>102</b> stores the final quality weighting factors (or the final quality weighting factor equations and/or functions) resulting from the iterative adjustments in its memory <b>208</b> for use in calculating subsequent hybrid measurements, as described above in the context of the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b>. In other embodiments, the metrology tool <b>102</b> may provide the final quality weighting factors to the host computing device <b>106</b>, which maintains the quality weighting factors in memory <b>118</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b> is performed for each different hybrid measurement determined by a metrology tool <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and/or the host computing device <b>106</b>, including the adjusted measurements determined by the secondary metrology tools <b>104</b> and/or the host computing device <b>106</b>, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">With the hybrid measurement method <b>300</b> and the weighting factor determination method <b>400</b>, accurate and/or reliable hybrid measurements for physical features and/or dimensions on a wafer are determined using measurements from different metrology tools, which might otherwise provide less accurate and/or less reliable measurements. To put it another way, composite measurements determined as a function of measurements from different non-destructive metrology tools may achieve a level of accuracy and/or reliability on par with highly accurate metrology tools which require longer amounts of measurement time and/or rely on destructive metrology techniques. Thus, highly accurate measurements can be obtained in a reduced amount of time and in a non-destructive manner by combining independent measurements from different metrology tools, as described above, thereby allowing a foundry or other fabrication entity to achieve a higher yield. For example, a foundry may fabricate a particular physical feature and/or dimension of interest for a semiconductor device or integrated circuit on a wafer of semiconductor material using conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques and utilize multiple metrology tools to measure that physical feature and/or dimensions and determine a hybrid measurement of that physical feature and/or dimension which is accurate and/or reliable without utilizing a destructive metrology technique (e.g., TEM or the like), thereby allowing the semiconductor device structure to function in the desired manner after being measured.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">After the hybrid recipe is determined, the fabrication method <b>600</b> configures the individual metrology tools of the hybrid measurement system to implement the hybrid recipe by modifying the measurement recipes and/or measurement algorithms of the individual metrology tools (task <b>612</b>).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">For example, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and with continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, the computing device <b>516</b> and/or the hybrid measurement system <b>506</b> receives or otherwise obtains, from one or more of the preceding processing tools <b>502</b> and/or the fabrication automation system <b>508</b>, information pertaining to the fabrication processes performed by the preceding processing tools <b>502</b>, and based on that fabrication process information, identifies the physical characteristics of features fabricated on the wafer <b>510</b>. Based on that information, the computing device <b>516</b> and/or the hybrid measurement system <b>506</b> is capable of automatically (i.e., without or otherwise independent of any manual input or other manual intervention) identifying or otherwise determining, in real-time, which physical feature(s) on the wafer <b>510</b> are to be measured.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In one exemplary embodiment, based on the identified feature to be measured (e.g., the gate dielectric undercut), the physical characteristics and/or material properties of that feature, and the metrology tool characteristics, the computing device <b>516</b> may identify that an optical critical dimension (OCD) tool should function as the primary metrology tool <b>514</b> that determines a hybrid measurement for the gate dielectric undercut and that an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tool and a critical dimension scanning electron microsopy (CDSEM) tool should function as secondary metrology tools <b>512</b> that measure other features of the wafer <b>510</b>. For example, the computing device <b>516</b> may determine that the AFM tool should obtain measurements of the gate sidewall angle, that the CDSEM tool should obtain measurements of the gate critical dimension (e.g., the gate width), that the gate sidewall angle measurements from the AFM tool should be provided to the CDSEM tool for augmenting the gate critical dimension measurement, and that the gate sidewall angle measurements and the gate critical dimension measurements should be provided to the OCD tool for determining the hybrid gate dielectric undercut measurement. In this regard, the hybrid recipe determined by the computing device <b>516</b> includes a sampling plan indicating a measurement sequence that begins with the wafer <b>510</b> being measured by the AFM tool first, then the CDSEM tool, followed by the OCD tool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Continuing the above example, to implement the hybrid recipe, the computing device <b>516</b> modifies the recipe of the AFM tool so that the AFM tool measures the sidewall angle of the gate structure fabricated on the wafer <b>510</b> and provides the gate sidewall angle measurement to the CDSEM tool, the OCD tool, and/or the computing device <b>516</b>. Similarly, the computing device <b>516</b> modifies the recipe of the CDSEM tool so that the CDSEM tool measures the critical dimension of the gate structure fabricated on the wafer <b>510</b> and modifies the algorithms utilized by the CDSEM tool to determine a hybrid gate critical dimension based on the raw feature measurement data obtained via its measurement arrangement <b>204</b> and the gate sidewall angle measurement from the AFM tool provided to the CDSEM tool by the AFM tool and/or the computing device <b>516</b>. In this regard, the algorithm used by the CDSEM tool when calculating the gate critical dimension may be modified using the gate sidewall angle measurement from the AFM tool. For example, one or more algorithm parameters or settings (e.g., a grayscale threshold or the like) may be modified (e.g., increased and/or decreased) based on the gate sidewall angle measurement from the AFM tool.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, in exemplary embodiments, process-enhanced hybrid measurements are calculated or otherwise determined using measurements obtained from one or more metrology tools in a manner that is influenced by process information obtained from the one or more processing tools, process control systems, factory control systems, or the like that quantifies or otherwise describes the fabrication processes the semiconductor device structure and/or wafer were subject to that is obtained from one or more processing tools, process control systems, factory control systems, or the like. The process information may be utilized to modify or otherwise adjust the weighting factors associated with feature measurements from multiple metrology tools to achieve an adjusted feature measurement that accounts for the actual processing of the semiconductor device structure and/or wafer. Alternatively, the process information may be appropriately weighted and combined with the feature measurements from multiple metrology tools to achieve an adjusted feature measurement. In other words, in exemplary embodiments, a process-enhanced hybrid measurement for a particular feature of interest is determined as a function of a measurement of that feature from a first metrology tool, one or more feature measurements (either of the feature of interest or another feature of the semiconductor device structure) obtained using one or more additional metrology tools (which may precede or succeed the first metrology tool in a measurement sequence), and process information that quantifies or otherwise describes the processing of the wafer having the particular feature of interest formed thereon by one or more processing tools, wherein each of the feature measurements and each of the different pieces of the process information are weighted or factored in a manner that corresponds to their accuracy, reliability and/or correlation with the actual dimensions of the feature of interest. Additionally, in some embodiments, the measurement configuration information (e.g., the measurement recipes or one or more of the measurement parameters or settings defined by a respective measurement recipe) for the respective metrology tools may also be utilized to determine the process-enhanced hybrid feature measurement. That is, a process-enhanced hybrid measurement may be determined using a function of a measurement of a feature from a primary metrology tool, one or more feature measurements from one or more secondary metrology tools, metrology configuration information for the primary metrology tool and/or one or more of the secondary metrology tool(s), and process information corresponding to processing by preceding processing tools.</div>

Thus, the subject matter described herein is not necessarily limited to any particular manner of combining feature measurements from different metrology tools and process information to achieve adjusted (i.e., process-enhanced) hybrid feature measurements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In a similar manner as described above in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for a particular feature of interest, weighting factors for different pieces of the process information are determined based on correlation of that respective piece of process information with the actual dimensions of the feature of interest. Thus, a model for a dimension of a feature as a function of different pieces of process information may be determined, with the weighting factors for a respective piece of process information being determined based on the correlation metric for that respective piece of process information with respect to the dimension of the feature. By using the correlation between process information and the feature dimensions in combination with the feature measurements from the metrology tools, process-enhanced hybrid feature measurement may be achieved with a desired level of accuracy and/or reliability while performing fewer measurements, thereby reducing metrology costs.</div>

For example, for a particular critical dimension measured by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, the computing device <b>716</b> and/or the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> may calculate a process-enhanced measurement of a critical dimension (CD) using the equation CD<sub>PS</sub>=γ<sub>S1</sub>CD<sub>S</sub>, where CD<sub>PS </sub>is the process-enhanced measurement for the critical dimension, CD<sub>S </sub>is the measurement for the critical dimension that was determined or otherwise measured by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> and γ<sub>S1 </sub>is a quality weighting factor for the feature measurement obtained by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> that is dependent on the values of the process information obtained for the preceding processing tool(s) <b>702</b>. In other words, the quality weighting factor may be a function of the process information obtained for the preceding processing tool(s) <b>702</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the quality weighting factor for the feature measurement obtained by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> may be a function of the measurement parameters or settings dictated by the measurement recipe implemented by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> in addition to the process information obtained for the preceding processing tool(s) <b>702</b>. In this manner, the feature measurement obtained by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> is adjusted or otherwise influenced by the obtained process information and the obtained measurement parameters or settings for the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">In other embodiments, the process-enhanced measurement for a particular feature on the wafer <b>720</b> may be calculated as a weighted sum of the feature measurement from the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, process information obtained from the process control system <b>708</b>, and the process information obtained from the factory control system <b>710</b> using the quality weighting factors. For example, for a particular critical dimension measured by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, the computing device <b>716</b> and/or the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> may calculate a process-enhanced measurement of a critical dimension (CD) using the equation CD<sub>PS</sub>=γ<sub>S1</sub>CD<sub>S</sub>+γ<sub>P1</sub>P<sub>1</sub>+γ<sub>P2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, where CD<sub>S </sub>is the measurement for the critical dimension that was determined or otherwise measured by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, P<sub>1 </sub>is a value representative of or otherwise influenced by the process information obtained from the process control system <b>708</b>, P<sub>2 </sub>is a value representative of or otherwise influenced by the process information obtained from the factory control system <b>710</b>, γ<sub>S1 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, γ<sub>P1 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the process information obtained from the process control system <b>708</b>, and γ<sub>P2 </sub>is the quality weighting factor associated with the process information obtained from the factory control system <b>710</b>. In one embodiment, the sum of the quality weighting factors is equal to one. Again, in some embodiments, the quality weighting factor for the feature measurement obtained by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> may be a function of the measurement parameters or settings dictated by the measurement recipe implemented by the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In a similar manner as described above in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to determine the quality weighting factors for the feature measurement from the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b> and the different pieces of process information used to calculated the process-enhanced feature measurement, the host computing device <b>716</b> may determine or otherwise identify the number of different pieces of process information from the process control system <b>708</b> and/or the factory control system <b>710</b> to be utilized in determining the process-enhanced measurement based on a feature measurement from the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, determine initial quality weighting factors for each respective piece of process information based on correlation metrics for the respective piece of process information with respect to the feature measurement (e.g., TMU, RMSU, R<sup>2 </sup>values or other correlation coefficients, and the like) along with an initial quality weighting factor for the feature measurement from the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>. After determining initial quality weighting factors for the different pieces of process information, an initial hybrid measurement is calculated or otherwise determined as a function of the initial quality weighting factors, the feature measurement from the secondary metrology tool <b>712</b>, and the pieces of process information, and the quality weighting factors may be iteratively adjusted or otherwise optimized to reduce the difference between the process-enhanced measurement and a reference measurement.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the process-enhanced measurement method <b>800</b> continues by obtaining process information pertaining to the fabrication of the semiconductor device structure on the wafer by one or more subsequent processing tools (task <b>808</b>). In this regard, after features on the wafer <b>720</b> are measured by the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>712</b>, the wafer <b>720</b> is transferred to one or more subsequent processing tools <b>704</b> for further processing. As described above, in some embodiments, the fabrication recipes used by the subsequent processing tools <b>704</b> may be influenced by the process-enhanced feature measurements that were determined based on the feature measurements from the secondary metrology tool(s) <b>712</b>. After the wafer <b>720</b> is processed by a processing tool <b>704</b> to further fabricate the semiconductor device structure on the wafer <b>720</b>, the host computing device <b>716</b> obtains process information that quantifies or otherwise describes the process environment that the semiconductor device structure to be measured was subjected to during fabrication of the semiconductor device structure by the processing tool <b>704</b>, such as, sensor data obtained by the processing tool <b>704</b> during processing of the wafer <b>720</b>, qualification data for the processing tool <b>704</b>, fault detection control data for the processing tool <b>704</b>, a position of the sensor device structure and/or the wafer <b>720</b> within the processing tool <b>704</b>, a duration of time for which the wafer <b>720</b> was processed by the processing tool <b>704</b>, and the like.</div>
