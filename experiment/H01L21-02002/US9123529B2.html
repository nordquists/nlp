<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention to be disclosed relates to a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. In addition, the invention to be disclosed relates to a method for manufacturing a reprocessed semiconductor substrate with the use of the method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, and relates to a method for manufacturing an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, instead of a bulk silicon wafer, integrated circuits using an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate that includes a thin single crystal silicon layer formed on an insulating surface have been developed. The characteristics of the thin single crystal silicon layer formed on the insulating surface make it possible to completely separate transistors formed in the integrated circuit from each other. Further, since fully-depleted transistors can be formed, a semiconductor integrated circuit with high added values such as high integration, high speed driving, and low power consumption can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, a hydrogen ion implantation separation method is known. The hydrogen ion implantation separation method is a method by which a single crystal silicon layer is obtained in the following manner: a single crystal silicon substrate (a bond substrate) into which hydrogen ions are implanted is bonded to another substrate (a base substrate) with an insulating layer provided between the substrates, and then the single crystal silicon substrate (the bond substrate) is separated along an ion implantation region by heat treatment. With the above hydrogen ion implantation separation method, an SOI substrate in which a single crystal silicon layer is provided over an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate can be manufactured (see Patent Document 1 as an example).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2004-87606</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">When a hydrogen ion implantation separation method is employed as a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, a plurality of SOI substrates can be manufactured from one bond substrate; therefore, there is an advantage that cost for the bond substrate in manufacturing an SOI substrate can be reduced. This is because, when the bond substrate from which a single crystal silicon layer has been separated is subjected to reprocessing treatment, the used bond substrate can be reused for manufacturing another SOI substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Here, a peripheral portion of the bond substrate, which is used for the above hydrogen ion implantation separation method, has a region called an edge roll off (E.R.O.) that is caused by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) treatment in a manufacturing step of the SOI substrate. This region is formed when an edge of the bond substrate is polished with a polishing cloth. The edge roll off region of the bond substrate has a curved surface and a thickness smaller than that in a central region of the bond substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">When an SOI substrate is manufactured by the ion implantation separation method, a bond substrate and a base substrate are bonded to each other by a mechanism of intermolecular force or the Van der Waals force; therefore, surfaces to be bonded need to have a predetermined degree of planarity. It is natural that the bond substrate and the base substrate be not bonded in the edge roll off region where the surface planarity is not secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, in the bond substrate from which the single crystal silicon layer has been separated, a single crystal silicon layer region and an insulating layer remain as a projection in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate including the above edge roll off region. This projection becomes a problem in a stage of reprocessing treatment of the bond substrate. The difference in height between the projection and the other region (a region where the bonding is performed properly) is only about several hundred nanometers. However, in order to remove the projection by polishing the surface through CMP treatment and reprocess the bond substrate as a novel bond substrate, the substrate has to be removed part of the substrate, which has a thickness of about 10 Î¼m in the thickness direction, so that there is a problem in that the number of times of reprocessing and using the bond substrate cannot be sufficiently secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the above problem, one object of an embodiment of the disclosed invention in this specification is to provide a method suitable for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. Another object of an embodiment of the present invention is to manufacture a reprocessed semiconductor substrate with the use of the method suitable for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. Still another object of an embodiment of the present invention is to manufacture an SOI substrate with the use of the reprocessed semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">An embodiment of the present invention is to remove a projection containing a single crystal silicon layer region and an insulating layer using a method capable of removing a semiconductor region damaged by ion addition or the like (hereinafter, also referred to as a damaged semiconductor region) preferentially, in other words, selectively. Further, the above method is used to manufacture a reprocessed semiconductor substrate, and an SOI substrate is manufactured using the reprocessed semiconductor substrate. Specifically, the following method can be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment of the present invention is a reprocessing method of a semiconductor substrate including the steps of subjecting a semiconductor substrate in which a projection including a damaged semiconductor region and the insulating layer is provided in a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate to etching treatment for removing an insulating layer and subjecting the semiconductor substrate in which the projection including the damaged semiconductor region and the insulating layer is provided in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate to etching treatment for selectively removing the damaged semiconductor region with a non-damaged semiconductor region left using a mixed solution including acid and, a substance dissolving a semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate and oxidized by the nitric acid, a substance controlling a speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and a speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, and nitrous acid, in which a concentration of the nitrous acid is higher than or equal to 10 mg/l and lower than or equal to 1000 mg/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, another embodiment of the present invention is a reprocessing method of a semiconductor substrate comprising the steps of subjecting a semiconductor substrate in which a projection including a damaged semiconductor region and an insulating layer remain in a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate to etching treatment for removing the insulating layer by separating a part of the semiconductor substrate as a semiconductor layer through irradiation with ions and heat treatment and subjecting the semiconductor substrate in which the projection including the damaged semiconductor region and the insulating layer remain in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate to etching treatment for selectively removing the damaged semiconductor region with a non-damaged semiconductor region left using a mixed solution including nitric acid, a substance dissolving a semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate and oxidized by the nitric acid, a substance controlling a speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and a speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, and nitrous acid, in which a concentration of the nitrous acid is higher than or equal to 10 mg/l and lower than or equal to 1000 mg/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above methods, the ion irradiation is preferably performed without mass separation. Further, the ion preferably includes an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In the reprocessing method of the semiconductor substrate, hydrofluoric acid is preferably used as the substance dissolving the semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate and oxidized by the nitric acid, and acetic acid is preferably used as the substance controlling the speed of oxidation and the speed of dissolution of the semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Another embodiment of the present invention includes a manufacturing method of a reprocessed semiconductor substrate in which any one of the reprocessing methods of the semiconductor substrate described above is used, and the reprocessed semiconductor substrate is manufactured from the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Still another embodiment of the present invention is a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, in which ions are added to a reprocessed semiconductor substrate manufactured using the aforementioned method to form an embrittlement region therein, the reprocessed semiconductor substrate is bonded to a base substrate with an insulating layer provided therebetween, and the reprocessed semiconductor substrate is separated by a heat treatment, whereby a semiconductor layer is formed over the base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Note that in this specification and the like, an SOI substrate refers to a substrate in which a semiconductor layer is formed on an insulating surface, and is not limited to a structure where a silicon layer is provided over an insulating layer. For example, an SOI substrate includes a structure where a silicon layer is directly formed on a glass substrate, a structure where a silicon carbide layer is formed over an insulating layer, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that in this specification, in contrast to a single crystal semiconductor region in which atoms constituting a crystal are arranged in a spatially ordered manner, the damaged semiconductor region refers to a region partly including disordered arrangements (crystal structures) of atoms constituting crystals, crystal defects, crystal lattice distortion, and the like due to the introduction of ions and the like. Further, in this specification, a non-damaged semiconductor region refers to a single crystal semiconductor region with atoms constituting a crystal which are arranged in a spatially ordered manner, and is equivalent to a single crystal semiconductor region which is not subjected to the introduction of ions and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the disclosed invention in this specification, a damaged semiconductor region can be selectively removed with respect to a non-damaged semiconductor region or a semiconductor region which is less damaged. Accordingly, the amount of loss of the semiconductor substrate due to removal by polishing or the like in reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate can be reduced, and the number of times of reprocessing and using the semiconductor substrate can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, when a reprocessed semiconductor substrate is manufactured by the above method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, the productivity of the semiconductor substrate in the reprocessing treatment can be improved. Accordingly, cost for manufacturing the reprocessed semiconductor substrate can be reduced.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment, an example of a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate and an example of a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate which is used for manufacturing the SOI substrate will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">&lt;Process for Manufacturing SOI Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">A process for manufacturing an SOI substrate is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref>. First, a base substrate <b>120</b> and a bond substrate are prepared (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">As the base substrate <b>120</b>, a substrate made of an insulator can be used. For example, variety of glass substrates used in the electronics industry, such as an aluminosilicate glass substrate, an aluminoborosilicate glass substrate, or a barium borosilicate glass substrate; a quartz substrate; a ceramic substrate, or a sapphire substrate can be given. Note that when the above glass substrate contains a large amount of boron oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), the heat resistance of glass is improved; and when it contains a larger amount of barium oxide (BaO) than boron oxide, more-practical heat-resistant glass can be obtained. Therefore, it is preferable that a glass substrate containing more BaO than B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>be used. Further, a substrate with high heat resistance may be used as the base substrate. Examples of a substrate with high heat resistance include a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, semiconductor substrates (e.g., a single crystal silicon substrate and a polycrystalline silicon substrate), and the like. Note that in this embodiment, a description is given of the case where a glass substrate is used as the base substrate <b>120</b>. The use of a glass substrate as the base substrate <b>120</b>, which realizes a larger size device and is inexpensive, can reduce costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">A semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be used as the bond substrate. For example, a single crystal semiconductor substrate formed using an element of Group 14, such as a single crystal silicon substrate, a single crystal germanium substrate, or a single crystal silicon germanium substrate, can be used. Further, a compound semiconductor substrate using gallium arsenide, gallium arsenide phosphide, indium gallium arsenide, or the like can be used. Typical examples of commercially available silicon substrates are circular silicon substrates which are 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, and 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter. Note that the shape of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is not limited to a round shape and can be a rectangular shape or the like obtained by processing. Further, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be manufactured by the Czochralski (CZ) method or the floating zone (FZ) method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, an embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed at a predetermined depth from a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Then, the base substrate <b>120</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are bonded to each other with insulating layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> provided therebetween (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above structure, the embrittlement region <b>104</b> can be formed by irradiating the insulating layer <b>123</b> formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> with hydrogen ion beams and introducing hydrogen ions into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the insulating layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> can be formed using a single layer or a stacked layer of insulating layers such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film. These films can be formed by a thermal oxidation method, a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that in this specification and the like, the term oxynitride means a substance that contains more oxygen (atoms) than nitrogen (atoms). For example, a silicon oxynitride is a substance including oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen in ranges of 50 at. % to 70 at. %, 0.5 at. % to 15 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 0.1 at. % to 10 at. %, respectively. Further, the term nitride oxide means a substance that contained more nitrogen (atoms) than oxygen (atoms). For example, silicon nitride oxide is a substance including oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen in ranges of 5 at. % to 30 at. %, 20 at. % to 55 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 10 at. % to 30 at. %, respectively. Note that the above ranges are obtained by measurement using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) or hydrogen forward scattering spectrometry (HFS). Moreover, the total of the percentages of the constituent elements does not exceed 100 at. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, by heat treatment or the like, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is separated along the embrittlement region <b>104</b> into a semiconductor layer <b>124</b> and a separated semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>, whereby the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is formed over the base substrate <b>120</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The separated semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> becomes a reprocessed semiconductor substrate through a reprocessing method of a semiconductor substrate described below and can be reused for manufacturing an SOI substrate. Note that, although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref>, a projection exists in a peripheral portion of the separated semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">When the heat treatment is performed, atoms added are separated out into microvoids which are formed in the embrittlement region <b>104</b> by ion beam irradiation, and internal pressure of the microvoids is increased. The increased pressure causes a crack in the embrittlement region <b>104</b>, so that the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is separated along the embrittlement region <b>104</b>. Since the insulating layer <b>122</b> is bonded to the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is left over the base substrate <b>120</b> with the insulating layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> interposed therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">After that, by subjecting the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> to surface treatment or the like, a flat semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is formed. As the surface treatment, there are irradiation treatment with a laser beam, etching treatment, and polishing treatment such as CMP, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Through the above process, an SOI substrate in which the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is provided over the base substrate <b>120</b> with the insulating layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> therebetween can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">&lt;Process for Forming Reprocessed Bond Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, a process for reprocessing the separated bond substrate <b>121</b> is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A projection <b>126</b> exists in a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The projection <b>126</b> includes an insulating layer <b>123</b>, an unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b>, and a semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added. Note that both the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added are damaged and include many crystal defects, voids, or the like, due to adding treatment of ions or the like in a manufacturing process of an SOI substrate. Therefore, the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added can be collectively referred to as a damaged semiconductor region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The above projection <b>126</b> includes an edge roll off region of the semiconductor substrate. The edge roll off region is caused by surface treatment (CMP treatment) of the semiconductor substrate. The CMP treatment is a treatment for flattening a surface of an object with a combination of chemical and mechanical actions. Since the thickness of the semiconductor substrate in the vicinity of the edge roll off region is smaller than that of a central region of the semiconductor substrate before the semiconductor layer is separated, bonding is not performed in the edge roll off region in manufacturing an SOI substrate. As a result, the projection <b>126</b> is left in the edge roll off region of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that a semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added exists in a region of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>, other than the projection <b>126</b>, (especially in a region surrounded by the above edge roll off region). The semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is formed in such a manner that a region to which ions are added, which is formed in the manufacturing process of the SOI substrate, is left in the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> after the semiconductor layer is separated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Here, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is sufficiently thin as compared to the semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added). Further, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added includes many crystal defects or the like generated due to damage by ions. Therefore, like the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added can also be referred to as a damaged semiconductor region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a schematic view in which the projection <b>126</b> is enlarged. The projection <b>126</b> includes a region corresponding to the edge roll off region and a region corresponding to a chamfer portion. In this embodiment, the edge roll off region refers to a set of points at which an angle Î¸ between a tangent plane of a surface of the projection <b>126</b> and a reference surface is 0.5Â° or less. Here, as the reference surface, a plane parallel to a front surface or a back surface of the semiconductor substrate is employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, when the chamfer portion is a region at a distance shorter than 0.2 mm from the end of the substrate, the edge roll off region can be defined as a region which is inside the chamfer portion and in which bonding is not performed. Specifically, for example, a region at a distance longer than or equal to 0.2 mm and shorter than or equal to 0.9 mm from the end of the substrate can be referred to as the edge roll off region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that because the chamfer portion does not affect the bonding between the base substrate and the bond substrate, the planarity of the chamfer portion does not matter in the reprocessing treatment of the substrate. On the other hand, the vicinity of the edge roll off region has an influence on the bonding between the base substrate and the bond substrate. Therefore, depending on the planarity of the edge roll off region, a reprocessed semiconductor substrate cannot be used in a manufacturing process of an SOI substrate in some cases. From such a reason, to remove the projection <b>126</b> in the edge roll off region to improve the planarity of the semiconductor substrate is quite important in the reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate includes not less than two etching treatments: an etching treatment for removing the insulating layer <b>123</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a first etching treatment) and an etching treatment for removing the damaged semiconductor region (hereinafter, referred to as a second etching treatment). These are described in detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">First, the first etching treatment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. As described above, the first etching treatment is etching treatment for removing the insulating layer <b>123</b> from the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be removed by wet etching treatment using a solution containing hydrofluoric acid as an etchant. As the solution containing hydrofluoric acid, a mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, ammonium fluoride, and a surfactant (e.g., product name: LAL 500, produced by Stella Chemifa Corporation) or the like is preferably used. Alternatively, a 5% hydrofluoric acid solution may be used. The wet etching treatment is preferably performed for approximately 180 seconds to 300 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Since wet etching treatment can be performed in such a manner that the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is soaked in a solution in a treatment tank, a plurality of semiconductor substrates <b>121</b> can be processed at once. Accordingly, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, as a first etching treatment, dry etching treatment may be performed. Alternatively, wet etching treatment and dry etching treatment may be used in combination. For the dry etching treatment, a parallel plate reactive ion etching (RIE) method, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the second etching treatment is described. In the second etching treatment, the damaged semiconductor regions, that is, the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added, which are included in the projection <b>126</b>, and the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added, are selectively removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, wet etching treatment is performed using, as an etchant, a mixed solution which includes nitric acid which is a substance that oxidizes a semiconductor material, a substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material by the nitric acid, a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, and nitrous acid which functions as an autocatalyst. The concentration of nitrous acid in a mixed solution is preferably higher than or equal to 10 mg/l and lower than or equal to 1000 mg/l, more preferably higher than or equal to 50 mg/l and lower than or equal to 300 mg/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The second etching treatment is preferably performed for approximately 30 seconds to 120 seconds. For example, in the case where a mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid, which is described below, at a volume ratio of 1:2:10 is used, the second etching treatment is preferably performed for approximately 45 seconds to 105 seconds. In addition, the temperature of the mixed solution is preferably approximately 10Â° C. to 40Â° C., for example, 30Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, as the substance dissolving the oxidized semiconductor material by the nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid is preferably used. Moreover, as the substance controlling the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, acetic acid is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In the case where a mixed solution of nitric acid (concentration of 70 weight %), hydrofluoric acid (concentration of 50 weight %), acetic acid (concentration of 97.7 weight %), and nitrous acid is used as an etchant, it is preferable that the volume of nitric acid be more than 0.01 times and less than one time as large as that of acetic acid and be more than 0.1 times and less than 100 times as large as that of hydrofluoric acid, and the volume of hydrofluoric acid be more than 0.01 times and less than 0.5 times as large as that of acetic acid. For example, it is preferable that the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid be 1:2:10 (the concentration of nitrous acid is higher than or equal to 10 mg/l and lower than or equal to 1000 mg/l).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, nitric acid contained in a mixed solution oxidizes a material included in a semiconductor substrate. For example, in the case where a silicon wafer is used as a semiconductor substrate, nitric acid oxidizes silicon, and this chemical reaction can be represented as the following formula (1).
<br/>
3Si+4HNO<sub>3</sub>â3SiO<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O+4NOââ(1)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Here, the formula (1) includes elementary process represented by the following formulae (2) and (3).
<br/>
HNO<sub>2</sub>+HNO<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>Oâ2HNO<sub>2</sub>+2OH<sup>â</sup>+2<i>h</i> <sup>+</sup>ââ(2)
<br/>
Si+4<i>h</i> <sup>+</sup>+2H<sub>2</sub>OâSiO<sub>2</sub>+4H<sup>+</sup>ââ(3)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In the formula (2), HNO<sub>2 </sub>functions as an autocatalyst for promoting its synthesis, and the amount of HNO<sub>2 </sub>is increased when the reaction progresses. Further, with the increase in the amount of HNO<sub>2</sub>, the oxidation rate of silicon is increased. In etching of a silicon wafer, the reaction occurs by dissolving oxidized silicon (SiO<sub>2</sub>); therefore, the oxidation rate of silicon is increased, whereby the etching rate of silicon is also increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Note that here, âetching rateâ means the etching amount (amount etched) per unit time. That is, âa film whose etching rate is highâ represents a film which is easily etched, and âa film whose etching rate is lowâ represents a film which is difficult to be etched. In addition, âto obtain etching selectivityâ means that, for example, a layer A and a layer B are etched under the condition where there is a sufficient difference between the etching rate of the layer A and the etching rate of the layer B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, when the concentration of nitrous acid in a mixed solution is low, a reaction represented by the above formula (2) is less likely to occur in initial state; therefore, the etching amount with respect to the etching time changes slightly. When the concentration of HNO<sub>2 </sub>is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, the reaction rate in the formula (2) is increased at an accelerated pace in proportion to the concentration of HNO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the etching rate of a mixed solution which has been left for a certain period is different from that in an initial state, and thus a stable etching rate cannot be easily obtained in the case where a substrate is continuously processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">On the other hand, in the mixed solution described in this embodiment, the concentration of nitrous acid is high (e.g., higher than or equal to 10 mg/l, preferably higher than or equal to 50 mg/l); therefore, reaction in the formula (2) is performed stably even in initial state. As a result, the etching amount with respect to the etching time can be increased linearly, so that stabilization of the etching rate can be achieved. Therefore, a substrate can be processed continuously, so that productivity can be improved. Further, in the mixed solution described in this embodiment, the etching rate is high; therefore, the treatment time can be shortened by performing reprocessing treatment using the mixed solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Note that in order that the concentration of nitrous acid in the mixed solution be high, a dummy substrate is subjected to wet etching treatment using, as an etchant, a mixed solution which includes nitric acid, a substance that dissolves the semiconductor material oxidized by the nitric acid, and a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, when the concentration of nitrous acid in the mixed solution is set too high, dissolution of the semiconductor material by a substance that dissolves the semiconductor material oxidized by the nitric acid is a rate-controlling factor of wet etching; therefore, the concentration of nitrous acid is set lower than or equal to 1000 mg/l, preferably lower than or equal to 300 mg/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Crystal defects, voids, and the like formed due to addition of ions exist in the damaged semiconductor region, and an etchant penetrates easily thereinto. Accordingly, in the damaged semiconductor region, etching progresses not only from a surface but also from the inside.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Specifically, the etching tends to progress in such a manner that a deep hole is formed in a direction perpendicular to the plane surface of the substrate and then the hole is expanded. In other words, in the damaged semiconductor region, etching treatment progresses at a higher etching rate than in a less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Note that in this specification and the like, the less-damaged semiconductor region refers to a semiconductor region in which the degree of damage is relatively low as compared to that of the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b>, the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The etching rate of the damaged semiconductor region in the case where the etchant is used is 1.7 times or more as high as that of the non-damaged semiconductor region (or the less-damaged semiconductor region). That is, the etching selectivity of the damaged semiconductor region to the non-damaged semiconductor region (or the less-damaged semiconductor region) becomes 1.7 or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In this manner, when the wet etching treatment is performed using, as an etchant, the mixed solution which includes nitric acid which is the substance that oxidizes the semiconductor material, the substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material by the nitric acid, the substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, and nitrous acid which functions as an autocatalyst, the damaged semiconductor region can be selectively removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Accordingly, in reprocessing treatment of a substrate, the amount of loss of the substrate due to removal by polishing or the like can be significantly smaller than ever before, and the number of times of reprocessing and using the substrate can be increased. Further, by the wet etching treatment, a plurality of semiconductor substrates <b>121</b> can be processed at one time; therefore, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment of the substrate can be increased. Furthermore, since the second etching treatment can be performed in a short time compared to the CMP treatment, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment of the substrate can be increased also for this reason.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the etchant used for a reprocessing method of the semiconductor substrate described in this embodiment includes nitrous acid as an autocatalyst, whereby the etching rate can be increased compared to a mixed solution without nitrous acid or with low-concentration nitrous acid; therefore, etching treatment can be performed in an extremely short time. Moreover, nitrous acid with high concentration (e.g., higher than or equal to 10 mg/l) is included, whereby reprocessing treatment of a substrate can be performed in a stable etching rate. Therefore, variation in the reprocessed semiconductor substrate can be reduced. Moreover, because of having the stable etching rate, the substrate can be processed continuously. Therefore, productivity of the reprocessed semiconductor substrate can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Note that the thickness of the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added) is largely different from that of the damaged semiconductor region in the other region (the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added). Therefore, the etching selectivity of the projection <b>126</b> (the peripheral portion) to the other region (the central portion) is not uniform during the second etching treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Specifics are described below. Immediately after the second etching treatment is started, the damaged semiconductor region is first etched both in the projection <b>126</b> and in the other region; thus, the etching selectivity is approximately 1. After the damaged semiconductor region other than the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added) is removed, the less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region is exposed in damaged semiconductor region other than the projection <b>126</b>. Thus, the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> is preferentially removed, and the etching selectivity becomes 1.7 or higher. After the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added) is etched to be removed, the less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region is exposed also in the projection <b>126</b>; thus, the etching selectivity returns to approximately 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In this manner, since the etching selectivity varies during the second etching treatment, the etching can be finished in consideration of the change of the selectivity. For example, by stopping the etching treatment at the stage where the etching selectivity is reduced to lower than 1.2, the damaged semiconductor region can be removed while the unnecessary over etching by the second etching treatment is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Note that the etching selectivity may be a value (a finite difference value) obtained by comparing each of the amounts of thickness of the projection <b>126</b> (the peripheral portion) and the other region (the central portion), which are reduced in a predetermined time (e.g., 30 seconds or 1 minute) or may be a value (a differential value) obtained by comparing the amounts of thickness reduced in an instant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In the above manner, the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is reprocessed, and the reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> is completed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Although most part of the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is removed by the above second etching treatment, part thereof is left in some cases. In such a case, other surface treatment is preferably performed after the second etching treatment so that the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is completely removed. As the surface treatment, polishing treatment typified by CMP treatment, laser beam irradiation processing, and the like are given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, the polishing treatment or the laser beam irradiation treatment may be performed a plurality of times. The order of the treatment steps can be determined as appropriate without limitation. Irradiation treatment with lamp light may be performed instead of the irradiation with a laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">As described in this embodiment, after an insulating layer is removed through the first etching treatment, the second etching treatment is performed using the mixed solution which includes nitric acid which is the substance that oxidizes the semiconductor material, the substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material by the nitric acid, the substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, and nitrous acid which functions as an autocatalyst, so that the damaged semiconductor region remaining in the periphery of the semiconductor substrate can be selectively removed. Therefore, the amount of loss of the substrate due to removal by polishing or the like can be significantly smaller than ever before, and the number of times of reprocessing and using the semiconductor substrate can be increased.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">Embodiment 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate of this embodiment, an SOI substrate is manufactured by bonding a semiconductor layer separated from a semiconductor substrate which is a bond substrate to a base substrate. The semiconductor substrate from which the semiconductor layer has been separated is subjected to reprocessing treatment and reused as a bond substrate. An example of a method for manufacturing the SOI substrate of this embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>, and a manufacturing process chart of an SOI substrate of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">First, a process of forming an embrittlement region <b>104</b> in a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to prepare for bonding with a base substrate <b>120</b> is described. This process relates to treatment for the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and corresponds to Process A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">First, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is prepared (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and the step A-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, for example, a single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate of silicon or the like can be used. Typical examples of commercially available silicon substrates are circular silicon substrates which are 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, and 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter. Further, in a peripheral portion of a silicon substrate, there is a chamfer portion for preventing chipping or cracking as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Note that the shape is not limited to the circular shape, and a silicon substrate which is processed into a rectangular shape or the like can also be used. The case in which a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate is used as the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is preferably cleaned using a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), ozone water, or the like, as appropriate. Further, diluted hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately to clean the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">After the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is cleaned, an insulating layer <b>123</b> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and the step A-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The insulating layer <b>123</b> may be formed using a single layer or a stacked layer including a plurality of insulating films. The insulating layer <b>123</b> can be formed using an insulating film which contains silicon as a component, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film. In this embodiment, the case of using a silicon oxide film as the insulating layer <b>123</b> is described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In the case of using silicon oxide for the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be formed using a mixed gas of silane and oxygen, a mixed gas of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) and oxygen, or the like by a vapor deposition method such as thermal CVD, plasma CVD, atmospheric pressure CVD, or bias ECRCVD. In this case, a surface of the insulating layer <b>123</b> may be densified by oxygen plasma treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Alternatively, a silicon oxide layer formed by a chemical vapor deposition method using an organosilane gas may be used as the insulating layer <b>123</b>. As an organosilane gas, a silicon-containing compound such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylsilane (TMS) (chemical formula: Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), triethoxysilane (SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), or trisdimethylaminosilane (SiH(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Further alternatively, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be formed using an oxide film obtained by oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Thermal oxidation treatment for forming the oxide film may be dry oxidation, and may be performed in an oxidation atmosphere to which a halogen-containing gas is added. As the halogen-containing gas, one or plural kinds of gases selected from HCl, HF, NF<sub>3</sub>, HBr, Cl<sub>2</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, and the like can be used. Note that the insulating layer <b>123</b> is formed to cover the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>; however, this embodiment is not limited to this structure. In the case where the insulating layer <b>123</b> is formed by a CVD method or the like on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, the insulating layer <b>123</b> may be formed on only one of the surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">As an example of formation conditions of the thermal oxide film, heat treatment is performed at higher than or equal to 700Â° C. and lower than or equal to 1100Â° C. (typically at approximately 950Â° C.) in an atmosphere containing HCl at a rate of 0.5 volume % to 10 volume % (preferably 3 volume %) with respect to oxygen. Treatment time may be 0.1 to 6 hours, preferably, 0.5 to 1 hour. The thickness of the oxide film to be formed can be set in the range of 10 nm to 1100 nm (preferably 50 nm to 150 nm), for example, 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">By such thermal oxidation treatment in an atmosphere containing a halogen element, the oxide film can contain the halogen element. By containing the halogen element at a concentration of 1Ã10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1Ã10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, the oxide film captures heavy metal that is an extrinsic impurity (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, or Mo), so that contamination of the semiconductor layer to be formed later can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, the insulating layer <b>123</b> containing a halogen element such as chlorine can serve to getter impurities (e.g., mobile ions of Na or the like) which adversely affect the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Specifically, by heat treatment which is performed after the insulating layer <b>123</b> is formed, impurities contained in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are separated out to the insulating layer <b>123</b>, reacted with the halogen atom (e.g., a chlorine atom), and captured. Accordingly, the impurities captured in the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be fixed and prevented from contaminating the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Further, when the insulating layer <b>123</b> is bonded to a glass substrate, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can also function as a film for fixing impurities such as Na contained in glass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In particular, the inclusion of halogen such as chlorine in the insulating layer <b>123</b> by heat treatment in an atmosphere containing halogen is effective in removing contaminants of the semiconductor substrate when cleaning of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is insufficient or when the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is repeatedly subjected to reprocessing treatment and used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, the halogen element contained in the oxidation treatment atmosphere terminates defects on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>; as a result, the local level density of an interface between the oxide film and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The halogen element contained in the insulating layer <b>123</b> makes distortions in the insulating layer <b>123</b>. As a result, water absorption rate of the insulating layer <b>123</b> is improved and diffusion rate of water is increased. That is, when water is present on the surface of the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the water present on the surface can be rapidly absorbed and diffused into the insulating layer <b>123</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In the case of using, as a base substrate, a glass substrate which contains impurities which decrease reliability of a semiconductor device, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, the insulating layer <b>123</b> preferably includes at least one or more films which can prevent the impurities in the base substrate from diffusing into the semiconductor layer of the SOI substrate. As such a film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, and the like can be given. With such a film included in the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can function as a barrier film (also referred to as a blocking film).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, a silicon nitride film can be formed using a mixed gas of silane and ammonia by a vapor deposition method such as a plasma CVD method.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, in the case of forming a barrier film having a single-layer structure as the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be formed using a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride oxide film with a thickness of greater than or equal to 15 nm and less than or equal to 300 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In the case of forming a two-layer barrier film as the insulating layer <b>123</b>, the upper layer is formed using an insulating film with a high barrier property. The upper layer of the insulating film can be formed using, for example, a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride oxide film with a thickness of 15 nm to 300 nm. These films have a high blocking effect for preventing impurity diffusion, but their internal stress is also high. Therefore, as an insulating film of a lower layer that is in contact with the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, it is preferable to select a film that has an effect of relieving the stress of an insulating film of the upper layer. Examples of the insulating film with an effect of relieving the stress of the upper insulating film include a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, and a thermally oxidized film formed by thermally oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The thickness of the lower insulating film can be greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, in order for the insulating layer <b>123</b> to function as a barrier film, the insulating layer <b>123</b> is preferably formed using a combination of a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film and a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film and a silicon nitride oxide film, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with an ion beam containing ions accelerated by an electric field through the insulating layer <b>123</b>, as indicated by arrows. Thus, the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed in a region at a desired depth from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> and the step A-<b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed is substantially the same as the average penetration depth of the ions, and can be adjusted by the acceleration energy of the ion beam and the incident angle of the ion beam. In addition, the acceleration energy can be adjusted by acceleration voltage or the like. The thickness of a semiconductor layer <b>124</b> which is separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> later is determined by the depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed. The depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed can be set in the range of, for example, greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 500 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 50 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>; for example, the depth is preferably approximately 100 nm from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Note that irradiation with ion beams is performed after formation of the insulating layer <b>123</b> in this embodiment; however, without being limited thereto, the irradiation with ion beams may be performed before the formation of the insulating layer <b>123</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The embrittlement region <b>104</b> can be formed by ion doping treatment. The ion doping treatment can be performed with an ion doping apparatus. A typical example of an ion doping apparatus is a non-mass-separation apparatus with which an object placed in a chamber is irradiated with all ion species generated by excitation of a process gas into plasma. The non-mass-separation apparatus is an apparatus with which an object is irradiated with ion beams containing all ion species without mass separation of ion species in plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Main components of an ion doping apparatus are as follows: a chamber in which an object is placed; an ion source for generating desired ions; and an acceleration mechanism for acceleration of ions for irradiation therewith.

As the electrode for generating plasma, a capacitively-coupled high-frequency discharge electrode, a filament electrode, or the like is used. The acceleration mechanism includes electrodes such as an extraction electrode, an acceleration electrode, a deceleration electrode, and a ground electrode. These electrodes included in the acceleration mechanism are provided with a plurality of openings or slits, through which ions that are generated from the ion source are accelerated. Note that components of the ion doping apparatus are not limited to those described above and may be changed as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In this embodiment, description is made of a case where the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with ion beams including all of the ion species that are generated such that a plasma source gas is plasma excited using the ion doping apparatus. A hydrogen-containing gas such as H<sub>2 </sub>is supplied as a plasma source gas. A hydrogen gas is excited to generate plasma; ions included in the plasma are accelerated without mass separation; and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with the accelerated ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In the above ion beam irradiation treatment, the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions to the total amount of ion species (H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>) that are generated from a hydrogen gas is set to 50% or higher. Preferably, the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions is set to 80% or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">This is because increase in the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions in plasma enables the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to be irradiated with hydrogen ions efficiently. Note that the mass of an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion is three times as large as that of an H<sup>+</sup> ion; therefore, when one hydrogen atom is added to the same depth, the acceleration voltage for an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion can be three times as high as that of an H<sup>+</sup> ion. From the above reason, the taken time in the ion irradiation step can be shortened, and productivity and throughput can be improved. By irradiation with ions having the same mass, ions can be added in a concentrated manner to the same depth in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Ion doping apparatuses are inexpensive and excellent for use in large-area treatment. Therefore, by irradiation with H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> by use of such an ion doping apparatus, significant effects such as an improvement in semiconductor characteristics, an increase in area, a reduction in costs, and an improvement in production efficiency can be obtained. Further, in the case where an ion doping apparatus is used, heavy metal may also be introduced at the time of the ion irradiation; however, by irradiation with ions through the insulating layer <b>123</b> containing chlorine atoms, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be prevented from being contaminated by the heavy metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, the embrittlement region <b>104</b> may be formed by ion implantation treatment using an ion implantation apparatus. The ion implantation apparatus is a mass-separation apparatus with which an object disposed in a chamber is irradiated with an ion beam having a specific ion spices after mass separation of plural kinds of ion species generated by excitation of a source gas into plasma. In the case of using an ion implantation apparatus, H<sup>+</sup> ions, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions which are generated by excitation of a hydrogen gas or PH<sub>3 </sub>are mass-separated, and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with any of these ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">With an ion implantation apparatus, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be irradiated with ion beams of one kind of ions and ions can be added to the same depth in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in a concentrated manner. Therefore, in the profile of the added ions in a depth direction, the peak can be sharpened, and thus the surface planarity of the semiconductor layer to be separated can be easily increased. Moreover, the ion implantation apparatus is preferable because, owing to its electrode structure, contamination by heavy metal is relatively low and thus deterioration of characteristics of the semiconductor layer can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> over which the insulating layer <b>123</b> is formed is cleaned. This cleaning step can be performed by ultrasonic cleaning with the use of pure water, by two-fluid jet cleaning with the use of pure water and nitrogen, or the like. The ultrasonic cleaning is preferably megahertz ultrasonic cleaning (megasonic cleaning) After the above ultrasonic cleaning or the two-fluid jet cleaning, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may be further cleaned with ozone water. By the cleaning with ozone water, removal of organic substances and surface activation treatment for improving the hydrophilic property of a surface of the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The surface activation treatment of the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be performed by irradiation treatment with an atomic beam or an ion beam, ultraviolet treatment, ozone treatment, plasma treatment, plasma treatment with bias application, or radical treatment instead of the cleaning with ozone water (see the step A-<b>4</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).

In an atmosphere containing oxygen, irradiation with ultraviolet rays having a wavelength of less than 200 nm and ultraviolet rays having a wavelength of greater than or equal to 200 nm is performed, whereby ozone can be generated and singlet oxygen can be generated by ozone.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Next, a process of preparing for bonding the base substrate <b>120</b> to the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is described. This process relates to treatment for the base substrate <b>120</b> and corresponds to Process B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">First, the base substrate <b>120</b> is prepared (see the step B-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As the base substrate <b>120</b>, a variety of glass substrates used in the electronics industry, such as a substrate of aluminosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass, or aluminoborosilicate glass; a quartz substrate; a ceramic substrate; a sapphire substrate; or the like can be used. In addition, as the base substrate <b>120</b>, a single crystal semiconductor substrate (for example, a single crystal silicon substrate) or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate (for example, a polycrystalline silicon substrate) may be used. For example, a polycrystalline silicon substrate has advantages of being less expensive than a single crystal silicon substrate and having higher heat resistance than a glass substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In the case where a glass substrate is used as the base substrate <b>120</b>, for example, a mother glass substrate which is developed for manufacturing liquid crystal panels is preferably used. As a mother glass substrate, substrates having the following sizes are known: the third generation (550 mmÃ650 mm), the 3.5-th generation (600 mmÃ720 mm), the fourth generation (680 mmÃ880 mm or 730 mmÃ920 mm), the fifth generation (1100 mmÃ1300 mm), the sixth generation (1500 mmÃ1850 mm), the seventh generation (1870 mmÃ2200 mm), the eighth generation (2200 mmÃ2400 mm), the ninth generation (2400 mmÃ2800 mm), the tenth generation (2850 mmÃ3050 mm), and the like. By manufacturing an SOI substrate with the use of a large-sized mother glass substrate as the base substrate <b>120</b>, the SOI substrate can have a large area. Increase in the area of the SOI substrate allows a plurality of ICs to be manufactured all at once, and thus the number of semiconductor devices manufactured from one substrate is increased; therefore, productivity can be dramatically increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Further, an insulating layer <b>122</b> is preferably formed over the base substrate <b>120</b> (see the step B-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Needless to say, the insulating layer <b>122</b> is not necessarily provided over the base substrate <b>120</b>; however, by forming a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, an aluminum nitride film, an aluminum nitride oxide film, or the like, which functions as a barrier film, over the base substrate <b>120</b> as the insulating layer <b>122</b> for example, impurities such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in the base substrate <b>120</b> can be prevented from entering the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Note that a region called an edge roll off region exists in a periphery of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">In the CMP method used for manufacturing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, owing to its principle, polishing tends to progress in the periphery of the semiconductor substrate at higher speed than in a central portion thereof.

This is because a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> which is not in contact with the base substrate <b>120</b> may be formed due to differences in the thickness of the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b>. Note that even in the case where there are slight differences in the thickness of the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b>, bonding can be favorably performed when the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b> can be closely attached to the base substrate <b>120</b> owing to bend of the base substrate <b>120</b> or the like; therefore, this embodiment is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">After the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is bonded to the base substrate <b>120</b>, heat treatment for increasing the bonding strength is preferably performed (see the step C-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The temperature of the heat treatment is preferably set to a temperature at which a crack is not caused in the embrittlement region <b>104</b>, for example, higher than or equal to 200Â° C. and lower than or equal to 450Â° C.

Examples of RTA apparatuses include a gas rapid thermal anneal (GRTA) apparatus, a lamp rapid thermal anneal (LRTA) apparatus, and the like. In the case of using a GRTA apparatus, the temperature can be set at higher than or equal to 550Â° C. and lower than or equal to 650Â° C., and the treatment time can be set to longer than or equal to 0.5 minute and shorter than or equal to 60 minutes.

Note that a method described in this embodiment is common to the above embodiment in many points. Therefore, different points will be mainly described in this embodiment. Drawings will not be particularly shown in this embodiment because drawings of this embodiment are in common with those of the above embodiment.</div>

Treatment and the like for the semiconductor substrate, which includes the formation of the insulating layer and the embrittlement region, are similar to those in the above embodiment. Therefore, description in the above embodiment may be referred to for such treatment and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">In this embodiment, a substrate with high heat resistance is used as a base substrate (corresponding to Process B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Examples of a substrate with high heat resistance include a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a single crystal silicon substrate or a polycrystalline silicon substrate), and the like. In this embodiment, the case where a single crystal silicon substrate is used as the base substrate is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">A typical example of a single crystal silicon substrate is a circular substrate which is 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, or 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter. Note that the shape is not limited to the circular shape, and a silicon substrate which is processed into a rectangular shape or the like can also be used. In the description given below, the case where a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate is used as the base substrate is described. Note that the size of the base substrate may be substantially the same as or different from that of the bond substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Note that a surface of the base substrate is preferably cleaned using a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), ozone water, or the like, as appropriate. Further, diluted hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately to clean the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">An insulating layer may be formed over the base substrate. In the case where an insulating layer is formed over the base substrate, an insulating layer on the bond substrate side can be omitted. The insulating layer may be formed using a single insulating film or a stacked layer including a plurality of insulating films. The insulating layer can be formed using an insulating film which contains silicon as a component, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">For example, the above insulating layer can be formed by thermal oxidation treatment. Although dry oxidation is preferably employed as the thermal oxidation treatment, the thermal oxidation treatment may be performed under an oxidation atmosphere to which a halogen-containing gas is added. As the halogen-containing gas, one or plural kinds of gases selected from HCl, HF, NF<sub>3</sub>, HBr, Cl<sub>2</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, and the like can be used</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">The surface of the base substrate is cleaned before bonding. The surface of the base substrate can be cleaned with hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide water or by megahertz ultrasonic cleaning, two-fluid jet cleaning, cleaning with ozone water, or the like. Further, the bonding may be performed after the surface is subjected to surface activation treatment such as irradiation treatment with an atomic beam or an ion beam, ultraviolet treatment, ozone treatment, plasma treatment, plasma treatment with bias application, or radical treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Next, the semiconductor substrate (the bond substrate) and the base substrate are bonded to each other, and the semiconductor substrate is separated (corresponding to Process C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Accordingly, a semiconductor layer is formed over the base substrate. The above embodiment can be referred to for details of this process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In this embodiment, the single crystal silicon substrate with high heat resistance is used as the base substrate. Therefore, the upper limit of the temperature of all kind of heat treatment can be raised up to the vicinity of a melting point of the single crystal silicon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">For example, the upper limit of the temperature of heat treatment for separating the semiconductor substrate can be set at approximately 1200Â° C. When the temperature of the heat treatment is set at 700Â° C. or higher, bonding strength with the base substrate can be further increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Next, a surface of the semiconductor layer bonded to the base substrate is planarized, and the crystallinity is recovered (corresponding to Process D in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">In the semiconductor layer which is closely attached to the base substrate, crystal defects due to formation of the embrittlement region and separation of the semiconductor substrate along the embrittlement region are formed, and the planarity of the semiconductor layer is lowered. Therefore, heat treatment is preferably performed to reduce the crystal defects and to improve the planarity of the surface. The heat treatment is preferably performed under the temperature condition of 800Â° C. to 1300Â° C., typically 850Â° C. to 1200Â° C. When heat treatment is performed under such a relatively high temperature condition, crystal defects can be sufficiently reduced and the planarity of the surface can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">For the heat treatment, a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) apparatus, a resistance heating furnace, a microwave heating apparatus, or the like can be used. For example, in the case where a resistance heating furnace is used, the heat treatment may be performed approximately at 950Â° C. to 1150Â° C. for 1 minute to 4 hours.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">The semiconductor layer may be irradiated with a laser beam before or after the heat treatment. By the laser beam irradiation, crystal defects that cannot be repaired by the heat treatment can be repaired. The above embodiment can be referred to for details of the laser beam irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition, before or after the heat treatment, a semiconductor region in an upper portion of the semiconductor layer may be removed by polishing or the like so that the surface thereof is planarized. By this planarization treatment, the surface of the semiconductor layer can be further planarized. Specifically, the polishing may be chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), liquid jet polishing, or the like. Note that the semiconductor layer may be reduced in thickness by this treatment in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">Alternatively, the semiconductor region in the upper portion of the semiconductor layer can be removed by etching so that the surface thereof is planarized.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">First, semiconductor substrates used in this example are described.</div>

The thermal oxidation was performed at 950Â° C. for 4 hours in a thermal oxidation atmosphere where the rate of HCl to oxygen was 3 volume %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Next, each of the semiconductor substrates was irradiated with ion beams through a surface of the thermal oxide film with the use of an ion doping apparatus. In this example, a hydrogen gas was excited to generate plasma; ions included in the plasma were accelerated without mass separation; and the accelerated ions were introduced into the semiconductor substrates, whereby an embrittlement region was formed in each of the semiconductor substrates.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">Next, treatment performed on the above semiconductor substrates is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">First, in order to remove an insulating layer which was formed to cover each of the semiconductor substrates, the semiconductor substrates were subjected to wet etching treatment using a 5% hydrofluoric acid solution.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Ten kinds of reprocessed semiconductor substrates manufactured by the above methods were observed with a magic mirror system and with an optical microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">In this example, the magic mirror system was the magic mirror system MIS-2000Z (produced by KOBELCO Research Institute, Inc.), and observed images were taken. The magic mirror system is an apparatus used to detect minute unevenness on a surface which is not easily visible even at close range. The patterns are detected by the application of the principle of the magic mirror: when the minute unevenness are carved on the surface of a mirror and light is reflected so that an image is formed at a distance increased by about several meters, the focal point starts to be blurred and seen as a pattern. With the principle of the magic mirror, invisible unevenness on a mirror-finished surface of a sample can be displayed as a dark image for the convex portion and the bright image for a concave portion. With the use of this apparatus, macro-level surface roughness, protuberance, concave, polishing dent, grinding marks, cracks, thermal slip, and the like on the surface of a substrate can be observed.</div>

On the other hand, in the reprocessed semiconductor substrate manufactured in this example, in the case where the etching time is set to 15 seconds to 120 seconds, there is little unevenness over the surface of the semiconductor substrate, and the planarity of the surface is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">On the right side in FIGS. <b>7</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>7</b>B<b>2</b>, <b>7</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>7</b>D<b>2</b>, and <b>7</b>E<b>2</b>, and FIGS. <b>8</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>8</b>B<b>2</b>, <b>8</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>8</b>D<b>2</b>, and <b>8</b>E<b>2</b>, the peripheral portion of the substrate is shown. In the reprocessed semiconductor substrate manufactured in this example, in the case where the etching time is 15 seconds, some remaining steps are observed, and in the case where the etching time is longer than or equal to 30 seconds, steps resulted from a remaining single crystal silicon layer having defects or the like were reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In addition, in this example, the etching amount of a silicon wafer in the case where the etching time was set to 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, 60 seconds, 75 seconds, 90 seconds, 105 seconds, 120 seconds, 135 seconds, and 180 seconds was measured. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a relation between the etching time and the etching amount of the silicon wafer. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the vertical axis represents the etching amount (Î¼m) of the silicon substrate and the horizontal axis represents the etching time (second).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">According to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it was confirmed that, in the etchant used in this example, the etching amount with respect to the etching time was increased linearly. Therefore, it is shown that a stable etching rate can be obtained by using the etchant in this example.</div>
