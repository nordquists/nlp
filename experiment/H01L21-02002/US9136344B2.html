<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-070383 filed on Mar. 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments discussed herein are related to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device, a semiconductor device, and a semiconductor crystal growth substrate.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">GaN, AlN, InN, which are nitride semiconductors, or materials made of mixed crystals thereof, have a wide band gap, and are used as high output electronic devices or short-wavelength light emitting devices. Among these, as high output devices, technologies are developed in relation to Field effect transistors (FET), more particularly, High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) (see, for example, patent document 1). A HEMT using such a nitride semiconductor is used for high output/high efficiency amplifiers and high power switching devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Specifically, a HEMT using a nitride semiconductor includes an AlGaN/GaN (aluminum gallium nitride/gallium nitride) hetero structure formed on a substrate, and the GaN layer is used as an electron transit layer. The substrate is usually made of sapphire, SiC (silicon carbide), GaN (gallium nitride), and Si (silicon).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">GaN, which is one kind of a nitride semiconductor, has a high saturated electron speed, a wide band gap, high breakdown voltage, and good electrical characteristics. Furthermore, GaN has a polarity in a (0001) direction parallel to a c axis (wurtzite form). Thus, when an AlGaN/GaN hetero structure is formed, due to lattice distortion caused by the difference in the lattice constant between AlGaN and GaN, piezo polarization is induced, and high-density 2DEG (Two-Dimensional Electron Gas) is generated near the interface in the GaN layer.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-359256</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">Patent document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2008-98434</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0008">Incidentally, when a nitride semiconductor layer including an AlGaN layer and a GaN layer is caused to epitaxially grow on a substrate made of Si or sapphire by a MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, a warpage is generated in the substrate on which films are formed. This kind of warpage in a substrate is considered to be generated due to stress in the formed semiconductor layer due to the difference in the lattice constants between the material forming the substrate and the material forming the semiconductor layer, and the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the material forming the substrate and the material forming the semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0009">As described above, if a warpage is formed in the substrate when a semiconductor layer is caused to epitaxially grow on the substrate, in subsequent procedures, for example, applying resist and forming an electrode, the following problem arises. That is, the substrate is not properly adsorbed, and it is not possible to convey the substrate. Furthermore, if a warpage is generated in the substrate, when exposure is performed with an exposing device, the pattern fluctuates, and exposure is not performed with a desirable precision. Accordingly, failures are caused in the process of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and the yield of semiconductor devices is reduced.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0020">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to accompanying drawings. The same elements are denoted by the same reference numerals and overlapping descriptions are omitted.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0021">In a case where a nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is caused to epitaxially grow on the surface of a substrate <b>10</b> made of Si, etc., by MOCVD, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, there is a case where compressive stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and a case where tensile stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>. The compressive stress or tensile stress generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is generated depending on film forming conditions of MOCVD. As compressive stress or tensile stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, a warpage is generated in the substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0022">When stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, the crystallinity and the electrical characteristics (device characteristics) when fabricating HEMT are better in the case where compressive stress is generated as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, than the case where tensile stress is generated as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. That is to say, it is known that when the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is caused to epitaxially grow on the substrate <b>10</b>, the crystallinity is better and the electrical characteristics of the fabricated HEMT is better in the case where compressive stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, rather than tensile stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0023">Furthermore, when HEMT is fabricated with the use of the substrate <b>10</b> made of Si, etc., as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, generally, the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is formed by causing a first buffer layer <b>21</b>, a second buffer layer <b>22</b>, an electron transit layer <b>23</b>, and an electron supply layer <b>24</b> to epitaxially grow. The first buffer layer <b>21</b> is made of AlN, the second buffer layer <b>22</b> is made of AlGaN, the electron transit layer <b>23</b> is made of GaN, and the electron supply layer <b>24</b> is made of AlGaN. Accordingly, in the electron transit layer <b>23</b> near the interface between the electron transit layer <b>23</b> and the electron supply layer <b>24</b>, 2DEG <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0024">Meanwhile, it is also known that when the back side of a substrate made of Si, etc., is ground with a grinding device, the front side of the substrate becomes recessed. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, before the substrate is ground, the front side of the substrate is slightly recessed (a vertical interval of approximately 40 μm on the front side). The back side of this substrate is ground by approximately 20 μm through 30 μm. Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, on the front side of the substrate, the shape of recess becomes more significant (a vertical interval of approximately 250 μm on the front side). In the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a semiconductor layer is formed on the surface of the substrate, and therefore the surface of the substrate is slightly recessed in the beginning. However, even in a case of grinding the back side of a flat Si substrate without a semiconductor layer, it is considered that the front side of the substrate becomes recessed. Furthermore, in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the back side of the substrate is ground by 20 μm through 30 μm. However, based on experiences of the inventor, it is known that the front side of the substrate becomes recessed even if the back side of a substrate having a flat surface is ground by only 2 μm through 3 μm. That is to say, it is known that if the back side of the substrate is ground by greater than or equal to 2 μm, the front side of the substrate becomes recessed. It is considered that the front side of the substrate becomes recessed by grinding the back side of the substrate due to the following reason. Specifically, by grinding the back side of the substrate, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a fracture layer <b>11</b> is formed on the back side of the substrate <b>10</b>, which is considered to cause the recess. That is to say, the grinding of the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> is performed in a state where force is applied to the back side of the substrate <b>10</b>. Therefore, the part of the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> where the fracture layer <b>11</b> is formed is considered to have high density due to the force applied in the grinding process. Accordingly, compressive stress is generated in the fracture layer <b>11</b>, and therefore the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> becomes protruded, which causes the front side of the substrate to become recessed. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the substrate <b>10</b> is made of Si; however, even with a substrate made of sapphire or SiC, as long as the fracture layer <b>11</b> is formed, it is presumed that the same tendency occurs. Furthermore, an example of a grinding device for grinding the back side of the substrate is a grinder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0025">The above contents are known as a result of intensive research conducted by the inventor, and an embodiment of the present invention is made based on this knowledge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Method of Manufacturing Semiconductor Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0026">Next, a description is given of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0027">First, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the substrate <b>10</b> is prepared. This substrate <b>10</b> has a silicon (111) surface, which is a flat surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0028">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> is ground by several tens of μm with a grinding device. Accordingly, on the back side of the substrate <b>10</b>, the fracture layer <b>11</b> also referred to as a damage layer of approximately 10 μm is formed. As the fracture layer <b>11</b> is formed on the back side of the substrate <b>10</b>, the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> deforms into a protruding shape, and accordingly, the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> deforms into a recessed shape. Subsequently, the substrate is sufficiently cleansed. Thus, a semiconductor crystal growth substrate according to the present embodiment is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0029">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, by MOCVD, the first buffer layer <b>21</b>, the second buffer layer <b>22</b>, the electron transit layer <b>23</b>, and the electron supply layer <b>24</b>, which constitute the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, are sequentially laminated by epitaxial growth on the surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. The first buffer layer <b>21</b> is made of AlN, the second buffer layer <b>22</b> is made of AlGaN, the electron transit layer <b>23</b> is made of GaN, and the electron supply layer <b>24</b> is made of AlGaN. Accordingly, in the electron transit layer <b>23</b>, near the interface between the electron transit layer <b>23</b> and the electron supply layer <b>24</b>, the 2DEG <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0030">The films are formed by epitaxial growth by MOCVD under conditions by which the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> protrudes, i.e., compressive stress is generated in the films, by forming the first buffer layer <b>21</b>, the second buffer layer <b>22</b>, the electron transit layer <b>23</b>, and the electron supply layer <b>24</b>. Accordingly, before forming films by MOCVD, the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> is recessed, but by causing the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> to epitaxially grow by MOCVD, the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> becomes flat or slightly protruded. That is to say, the stress that causes the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> to become recessed by the fracture layer <b>11</b> formed by grinding, and the stress that is generated by the epitaxial growth of the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and that causes the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> to become protruded, partially cancel out each other. Therefore, the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> becomes flat or slightly protruded. This state is nearer a flat state, compared to the case of using a substrate that is flat in the beginning and forming a nitride semiconductor layer under conditions by which compressive stress is generated. As described above, in the present embodiment, the surface of the substrate <b>10</b> becomes near a flat state, and therefore it is possible to adsorb the substrate without any problem when conveying the substrate, and when exposure is performed with an exposing device, patterns are precisely formed without fluctuating. Thus, it is possible to mitigate problems from occurring in the process of manufacturing semiconductor devices, and therefore the yield of semiconductor devices is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0031">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, on the electron supply layer <b>24</b>, a gate electrode <b>31</b>, a source electrode <b>32</b>, and a drain electrode <b>33</b> are formed with a metal material, and the elements are separated with a dicing saw. Accordingly, a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment is fabricated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0032">In the semiconductor device manufactured by the method according to the present embodiment, compressive stress is generated in the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b>, and therefore the electrical characteristics are good. Furthermore, the surface of the substrate <b>10</b> after forming the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> is near a flat state. Therefore, the substrate may be conveyed without any problem, and patterns are prevented from fluctuating when exposure is performed. Therefore, microscopic wirings are accurately formed. Thus, the semiconductor device manufactured by the method according to the present embodiment has good electrical characteristics, and the yield is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0033">In the method described above, before forming the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> by MOCVD, the back side of the substrate <b>10</b> is ground in order to make the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> have a recessed shape. However, if there is any method other than grinding of making the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> have a recessed shape, the other method may be performed to make the front side of the substrate <b>10</b> have a recessed shape. Furthermore, if it is possible to fabricate a substrate <b>10</b> having a recessed shape on the front side from the beginning by another method, the nitride semiconductor layer <b>20</b> may be formed on the front side the substrate <b>10</b> having a recessed shape from the beginning, by epitaxial growth by performing MOCVD.</div>
