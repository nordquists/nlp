<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of flattening a sapphire substrate obtained by slicing an ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The surface of a wafer obtained by slicing an ingot with a wire saw has fine undulation (irregularities) and strain. To remove such undulation and strain, both sides of the wafer are ground and polished to be flattened. For example, a wafer flattening method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-151099 includes the steps of measuring the undulation of a wafer, applying a liquid resin to a film to form a resin layer on the film, attaching one side surface of the wafer to the resin layer, selectively applying ultrasonic waves to the wafer according to the undulation measured above to thereby partially reduce the viscosity of the liquid resin and restore the undulation of the wafer, curing the liquid resin, and grinding the other side surface of the wafer to remove the undulation on the other side surface of the wafer, thus sufficiently removing the undulation on the other side surface of the wafer irrespective of the undulation on one side surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, a wafer flattening method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-249652 includes the steps of holding one side surface of a wafer on a horizontal holding surface under suction to thereby correct the undulation on one side surface of the wafer and make this surface horizontal, grinding the other side surface of the wafer to remove the strain on the other side surface, holding the other side surface of the wafer on the horizontal holding surface under suction to thereby correct the undulation on the other side surface of the wafer and make this surface horizontal, grinding one side surface of the wafer to remove the strain on one side surface, whereby similar grinding strains are given to one side surface and the other side surface of the wafer, and finally flattening both side surfaces of the wafer, so that a warp or bow due to the strain in the wafer can be effectively removed to achieve high flatness.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a sapphire ingot is hard and a large stress is therefore generated in slicing the sapphire ingot by using a wire saw. Accordingly, a residual stress is left in a sapphire substrate obtained by slicing the sapphire ingot with the wire saw. Conventionally, the surface of the sapphire substrate is flattened without consideration of the residual stress left in the sapphire substrate. As a result, a warp or bow is generated due to the residual stress left in the sapphire substrate, causing a problem that high flatness cannot be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a sapphire substrate flattening method which can suppress the generation of a warp or bow due to the residual stress left in a sapphire substrate sliced from a sapphire ingot, thereby achieving high flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sapphire substrate flattening method including an ingot slicing step of slicing a sapphire single-crystal ingot to obtain a sapphire substrate; an annealing step of annealing said sapphire substrate obtained by said ingot slicing step; a wafer mounting step of mounting said sapphire substrate processed by said annealing step on a stage having a holding surface in the condition where a first surface of said sapphire substrate is in contact with said holding surface of said stage through a liquid resin; a resin curing step of curing said liquid resin after performing said wafer mounting step; a first grinding step of grinding a second surface of said sapphire substrate opposite to said first surface after performing said resin curing step; a resin removing step of removing said liquid resin cured on said first surface of said sapphire substrate after performing said first grinding step; and a second grinding step of grinding said first surface of said sapphire substrate after performing said resin removing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In the sapphire substrate flattening method according to the present invention, the sapphire substrate obtained by slicing the sapphire single-crystal ingot is annealed to thereby remove the residual stress left in the sapphire substrate. Thereafter, both side (first and second surfaces) of the sapphire substrate is subjected to flattening. Accordingly, the generation of a warp or bow due to the residual stress can be suppressed to thereby ensure high flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing some preferred embodiments of the invention.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a flow <b>10</b> of the sapphire substrate flattening method according to the present invention. The flow <b>10</b> has the following procedure. An ingot slicing step <b>11</b> is first performed to slice a sapphire single-crystal ingot into sapphire substrates by using a wire saw. An annealing step <b>12</b> is next performed to anneal the sapphire substrates obtained by the ingot slicing step <b>11</b>. A wafer mounting step <b>13</b> is next performed to mount each sapphire substrate processed by the annealing step <b>12</b> on a stage having a holding surface in the condition where one side surface (first surface) of this sapphire substrate is in contact with the holding surface of the stage through a liquid resin. A resin curing step <b>14</b> is next performed to cure the liquid resin adhering to the sapphire substrate processed by the wafer mounting step <b>13</b>. A first grinding step <b>15</b> is next performed to grind the other side surface (second surface) of the sapphire substrate processed by the resin curing step <b>14</b>. A resin removing step <b>16</b> is next performed to remove the liquid resin cured on the first surface of the sapphire substrate processed by the first grinding step <b>15</b>. A second grinding step <b>17</b> is next performed to grind the first surface of the sapphire substrate processed by the resin removing step <b>16</b>. These steps will now be individually described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0005" num="0000">(1) Ingot Slicing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a sapphire substrate <b>20</b> obtained by slicing a sapphire single-crystal ingot with a wire saw. The sapphire substrate <b>20</b> has a first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and a second surface <b>21</b> <i>b</i>. The first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>has a processing strain <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and an undulation <b>23</b> <i>a</i>. Similarly, the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>has a processing strain <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and an undulation <b>23</b> <i>b</i>. Further, a warp or bow is generated in the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> due to the processing strains <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and internal residual stress (not shown). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is enlarged in the direction along the thickness thereof to emphasize the surface irregularities of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>. The same also applies to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref> to be hereinafter referred to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">(2) Annealing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown an annealing apparatus <b>60</b> for performing the annealing step. The annealing apparatus <b>60</b> includes a wafer rack <b>61</b> for placing the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> obtained by the ingot slicing step, an inner tube <b>62</b> for surrounding the wafer rack <b>61</b>, an outer tube <b>63</b> connected to the inner tube <b>62</b> for surrounding the inner tube <b>62</b>, a heater <b>64</b> provided outside the outer tube <b>63</b>, a wafer rack elevating mechanism <b>65</b> for loading and unloading the wafer rack <b>61</b> into and from the inner tube <b>62</b>, and an anneal gas supplying mechanism <b>66</b> for supplying an anneal gas into the inner tube <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Examples of the anneal gas include air and a mixed gas of 20% oxygen and 80% argon. The anneal gas supplied into the inner tube <b>62</b> by the anneal gas supplying mechanism <b>66</b> is agitated toward the plural sapphire substrates <b>20</b> stored in the wafer rack <b>61</b> and next guided through the outer tube <b>63</b> to a gas outlet <b>631</b> formed through the wall of the outer tube <b>63</b> from which gas outlet <b>631</b> the anneal gas is exhausted. The outer tube <b>63</b> functions to prevent that any substance contaminating the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> may enter the inner tube <b>62</b> from the heater <b>64</b>. Further, any contaminant not completely blocked by the outer tube <b>63</b>, but entered the outer tube <b>63</b> is discharged together with the anneal gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In performing the annealing step <b>12</b>, the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> are placed in the wafer rack <b>61</b>, and the wafer rack elevating mechanism <b>65</b> is then operated to insert the wafer rack <b>61</b> into the inner tube <b>62</b>. Thereafter, the anneal gas supplying mechanism <b>66</b> is operated to supply the anneal gas into the inner tube <b>62</b>. Thereafter, the heater <b>64</b> is operated to heat the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> placed in the wafer rack <b>61</b>, thereby annealing the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time. By annealing the sapphire substrates <b>20</b> in this manner, the residual stress in each sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is removed. Further, the processing strains <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and <b>22</b> <i>b </i>on the surfaces of each sapphire substrate <b>20</b> are also removed to some extent by this annealing. The annealing temperature is preferably set to 900 to 1650° C., for example, which is suitable for sapphire. In an experiment, the residual stress in each sapphire substrate could be removed by performing the annealing at 1400° C. for four hours or at 1250° C. for four hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the warp or bow of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the annealing step is reduced because the residual stress in the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> has been removed and the processing strains <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and <b>22</b> <i>b </i>have also been removed to some extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">(3) Wafer Mounting Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a resin coating apparatus <b>30</b> for performing the wafer mounting step. The resin coating apparatus <b>30</b> includes a stage <b>33</b> having a horizontal holding surface <b>331</b>. The stage <b>33</b> is formed of a material capable of transmitting ultraviolet radiation. The resin coating apparatus <b>30</b> further includes holding means <b>31</b> having a pressure pad <b>311</b>. A holding member <b>32</b> having a suction holding surface <b>321</b> is provided on the lower surface of the pressure pad <b>311</b>. The sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is held under suction on the suction holding surface <b>321</b> of the holding member <b>32</b>. A film <b>41</b> is placed on the holding surface <b>331</b> of the stage <b>33</b>, and an ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> (liquid resin) in the form of a liquid is dropped onto this film <b>41</b>. Thereafter, the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> held under suction by the holding means <b>31</b> is placed on the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> dropped onto the film <b>41</b> placed on the holding surface <b>331</b> of the stage <b>33</b>. Thereafter, the pressure pad <b>311</b> is operated to apply a uniform pressure to the whole surface of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>, thereby spreading the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b>. As a result, the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is entirely coated with the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b>. Thereafter, the suction from the suction holding surface <b>321</b> is stopped to release the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> from the holding means <b>31</b>. Thereafter, the holding means <b>31</b> is retracted upward as shown by an arrow C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">(4) Resin Curing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, ultraviolet radiation is applied from a UV lamp <b>34</b> through the stage <b>33</b> and the film <b>41</b> to the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> covering the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>(lower surface) of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>, thereby curing the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b>. The UV lamp <b>34</b> is located below the stage <b>33</b>. Accordingly, the lower surface of the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> cured above is formed as a flat surface <b>421</b> with reference to the horizontal holding surface <b>331</b> of the stage <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">(5) First Grinding Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a grinding apparatus <b>50</b> for performing the first grinding step. The grinding apparatus <b>50</b> includes a chuck table <b>51</b> for holding the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>, a table support <b>52</b> for rotatably supporting the chuck table <b>51</b>, a grinding unit <b>53</b> for grinding the upper surface (second surface <b>21</b> <i>b</i>) of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> held on the chuck table <b>51</b>, and feeding means <b>54</b> for vertically moving the grinding unit <b>53</b>. The grinding unit <b>53</b> includes a plurality of abrasive members <b>531</b> annularly arranged and rotatably mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> bonded through the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> to the film <b>41</b> is held on a holding surface <b>51</b> (upper surface) of the chuck table <b>51</b> in the condition where the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>not coated with the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> is oriented upward, i.e., the flat surface <b>421</b> is oriented downward. Thereafter, the feeding means <b>54</b> is operated to lower the grinding unit <b>53</b>, and the abrasive members <b>531</b> of the grinding unit <b>53</b> is rotated and pressed on the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>, thereby grinding the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b</i>. Since the flat surface <b>421</b> of the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> is held on the holding surface <b>511</b> of the chuck table <b>51</b> through the film <b>41</b>, the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> held on the chuck table <b>51</b> can be ground flat without being influenced by the undulation <b>23</b> <i>a </i>of the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">(6) Resin Removing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the film <b>41</b> is peeled from the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the first grinding step. At this time, the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> cured is also peeled from the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> together with the film <b>41</b>. As a result, the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">(7) Second Grinding Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the resin removing step shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is turned upside down to make a condition that the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>not ground is oriented upward, i.e., the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>ground to be flattened is oriented downward. The second grinding step of grinding the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is also performed by using the grinding apparatus <b>50</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. That is, the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the resin removing step is held on the holding surface <b>511</b> of the chuck table <b>51</b> in the condition where the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is oriented upward as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thereafter, the abrasive members <b>531</b> of the grinding unit <b>53</b> are rotated and pressed on the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b>, thereby grinding the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a</i>. The second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> has already been ground flat by the first grinding step mentioned above, so that the undulation <b>23</b> <i>a </i>of the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>is not influenced by the holding of the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>on the chuck table <b>51</b>, but the first surface <b>21</b> <i>a </i>can be ground flat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, each sapphire substrate obtained by slicing the sapphire single-crystal ingot is annealed to thereby remove the residual stress left in the sapphire substrate. As a result, the warp or bow of the sapphire substrate can be removed. Thereafter, both sides (first and second surfaces) of the sapphire substrate are subjected to flattening. Accordingly, the influence of the warp or bow of the sapphire substrate can be eliminated in flattening the surfaces of the sapphire substrate, thereby ensuring high flatness. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a substrate surface having ultraflat terrace surfaces with the same crystal orientation and linear regular step edges, which is suitable for an insulating substrate in a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As similar to the primary grinding step described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-249652, double-side grinding may be performed to the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the annealing step <b>12</b>. In this case, the processing strains <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and <b>22</b> <i>b </i>on both sides of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> can be removed to thereby ensure higher flatness. As a modification, both sides of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> obtained by the ingot slicing step <b>11</b> may be ground by the primary grinding step described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-249652. Thereafter, this sapphire substrate <b>20</b> may be annealed by the annealing step <b>12</b>. In this case, a grinding strain generated in the primary grinding step can be removed by the annealing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">As another modification, the undulation measuring step and the undulation restoring step described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2011-151099 and 2011-249652 may be performed to the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> processed by the annealing step <b>12</b> (or the sapphire substrate processed by the primary grinding step), wherein the undulation <b>23</b> <i>b </i>of the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is measured and the undulation <b>23</b> <i>b </i>of the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> placed on the stage <b>33</b> is restored. Thereafter, the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> is cured in the resin curing step <b>14</b>. In this case, even when the sapphire substrate <b>20</b> is pressed on the ultraviolet curable resin <b>42</b> in the condition where the undulation <b>23</b> <i>b </i>of the second surface <b>21</b> <i>b </i>is corrected, the undulation <b>23</b> <i>b </i>can be restored, so that higher flatness can be ensured.</div>
