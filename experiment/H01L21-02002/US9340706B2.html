<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">In the fabrication of integrated circuits and other electronic devices, multiple layers of conducting, semiconducting, and dielectric materials are deposited onto or removed from a substrate surface. As layers of materials are sequentially deposited onto and removed from the substrate, the uppermost surface of the substrate may become non-planar and require planarization. Planarizing a surface, or “polishing” a surface, is a process where material is removed from the surface of the substrate to form a generally even, planar surface. Planarization is useful in removing undesired surface topography and surface defects, such as rough surfaces, agglomerated materials, crystal lattice damage, scratches, and contaminated layers or materials. Planarization is also useful in forming features on a substrate by removing excess deposited material used to fill the features and to provide an even surface for subsequent levels of metallization and processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Compositions and methods for planarizing or polishing the surface of a substrate are well known in the art. Chemical-mechanical planarization, or chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), is a common technique used to planarize substrates. CMP utilizes a chemical composition, known as a CMP composition or more simply as a polishing composition (also referred to as a polishing slurry) for selective removal of material from the substrate. Polishing compositions typically are applied to a substrate by contacting the surface of the substrate with a polishing pad (e.g., polishing cloth or polishing disk) saturated with the polishing composition. The polishing of the substrate typically is further aided by the chemical activity of the polishing composition and/or the mechanical activity of an abrasive suspended in the polishing composition or incorporated into the polishing pad (e.g., fixed abrasive polishing pad).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">As the size of integrated circuits is reduced and the number of integrated circuits on a chip increases, the components that make up the circuits must be positioned closer together in order to comply with the limited space available on a typical chip. Effective isolation between circuits is important for ensuring optimum semiconductor performance. To that end, shallow trenches are etched into the semiconductor substrate and filled with insulating material to isolate active regions of the integrated circuit. More specifically, shallow trench isolation (STI) is a process in which a silicon nitride layer is formed on a silicon substrate, shallow trenches are formed via etching or photolithography, and a dielectric layer is deposited to fill the trenches. Due to variation in the depth of trenches formed in this manner, it is typically necessary to deposit an excess of dielectric material on top of the substrate to ensure complete filling of all trenches. The dielectric material (e.g., a silicon oxide) conforms to the underlying topography of the substrate. Thus, the surface of the substrate is characterized by raised areas of the overlying oxide between trenches, which are referred to as pattern oxide. Pattern oxide is characterized by the step height of the excess oxide dielectric material lying outside of the trenches. The excess dielectric material is typically removed by a CMP process, which additionally provides a planar surface for further processing. As pattern oxide is abraded and planarity of the surface is approached, the oxide layer is then referred to as blanket oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A polishing composition can be characterized according to its polishing rate (i.e., removal rate) and its planarization efficiency. The polishing rate refers to the rate of removal of a material from the surface of the substrate, and is usually expressed in terms of units of length (thickness) per unit of time (e.g., Angstroms (Å) per minute). Planarization efficiency relates to step height reduction versus amount of material removed from the substrate. Specifically, a polishing surface first contacts the “high points” of the surface and must remove material in order to form a planar surface. A process that results in achieving a planar surface with less removal of material is considered to be more efficient than a process requiring removal of more material to achieve planarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Often the rate of removal of the silicon oxide pattern can be rate-limiting for the dielectric polishing step in STI processes, and therefore high removal rates are desired to increase device throughput. However, if the blanket removal rate is too rapid, overpolishing of oxide in exposed trenches results in trench erosion and increased device defectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A need remains for compositions and methods for chemical-mechanical polishing of silicon oxide-containing substrates that will provide useful removal rates and desirable planarization efficiency, without excessive erosion of silicon oxide within the trenches. The invention provides such polishing compositions and methods. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Desirably, the polishing composition contains a low content of abrasive particles (i.e., a low solids content). A low solids content desirably allows for useful removal rates of the substrate being polished while minimizing defectivity and excessive removal rates of other components of the substrate that are observed with higher abrasive levels (e.g., greater than about 5 wt. % solids content). Thus, the polishing composition desirably comprises first abrasive particles, second abrasive particles, and any additional abrasive particles at a combined (total) concentration of about 0.01 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, e.g., about 0.05 wt. % to about 4 wt. %, about 0.075 wt. % to about 3 wt. %, or about 0.1 wt. % to about 2 wt. %.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The first abrasive particles and the second abrasive particles can be present in the polishing composition at any suitable ratio. The ratio of the first abrasive particles to the second abrasive particles is determined on a weight (concentration) basis. In particular, the ratio represents the weight percentage of the first abrasive particles present in the polishing composition as compared to the weight percentage of the second abrasive particles present in the polishing composition. The ratio of the concentration of the first abrasive particles present in the polishing composition to the concentration of the second abrasive particles present in the polishing composition can be about 1:10 or higher, e.g., about 1:5 or higher, about 1:3 or higher, about 1:2 or higher, or about 1:1 or higher. Alternatively, or in addition, the ratio of the concentration of the first abrasive particles present in the polishing composition to the concentration of the second abrasive particles present in the polishing composition can be about 30:1 or lower, e.g., about 20:1 or lower, about 15:1 or lower, about 10:1 or lower, about 5:1 or lower, about 2:1 or lower, about 1.5:1 or lower, about 1:1 or lower, or about 1:5 or lower. Thus, the ratio of the concentration of the first abrasive particles present in the polishing composition to the concentration of the second abrasive particles present in the polishing composition can be within a range bounded by any two of the aforementioned endpoints. For example, the ratio of the concentration of the first abrasive particles present in the polishing composition to the concentration of the second abrasive particles present in the polishing composition can be about 1:10 to about 1:1, about 1:10 to about 1:5, about 1:10 to about 1:3, about 1:5 to about 1:1, about 1:3 to about 1:1, about 1:5 to about 1:3, about 1:1 to about 30:1, about 1:1 to about 20:1, about 1:1 to about 15:1, about 1:1 to about 10:1, about 1:1 to about 5:1, about 1:1 to about 2:1, or about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.</div>

When the first, second, and additional abrasive particles are suspended in the polishing composition, the first, second, and additional abrasive particles preferably are colloidally stable. The term colloid refers to the suspension of abrasive particles in the aqueous carrier. Colloidal stability refers to the maintenance of that suspension over time. In the context of this invention, abrasive particles are considered colloidally stable if, when the abrasive particles are placed into a 100 ml graduated cylinder and allowed to stand unagitated for a time of 2 hours, the difference between the concentration of panicles in the bottom 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([B] in terms of g/ml) and the concentration of particles in the top 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([T] in terms of g/ml) divided by the initial concentration of particles in the abrasive composition ([C] in terms of g/ml) is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., {[B]−[T]}/[C]≦0.5).

The terms “maximum” and “maxima” mean a peak or peaks in the particle size distribution. The peak or peaks correspond to the average particle sizes described herein for the first, second, and any additional abrasive particles. Thus, for example, when the polishing composition contains first abrasive particles and second abrasive particles, with no additional abrasive particles, then a plot of the number of particles versus particle size will reflect a bimodal particle size distribution, with a first peak in the particle size range of about 30 nm to about 1 μm and a second peak in the particle size range of about 1 nm to about 60 nm.</div>

Alternatively, one or more of the flow lines can lead into a mixing device to facilitate the combination of two or more of the components. Any suitable mixing device can be used. For example, the mixing device can be a nozzle or jet (e.g., a high pressure nozzle or jet) through which two or more of the components flow. Alternatively, the mixing device can be a container-type mixing device comprising one or more inlets by which two or more components of the polishing composition are introduced to the mixer, and at least one outlet through which the mixed components exit the mixer to be delivered to the point-of-use, either directly or via other elements of the apparatus (e.g., via one or more flow lines).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) pattern wafers were also polished for 45 seconds with Polishing Compositions 1A-1F. The TEOS pattern wafers had a 500 μm feature size with 50% density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The substrates were polished with Polishing Compositions 1A-1F under the same polishing conditions. In particular, the substrates were polished on a Mirra™ polisher (Applied Materials) with an IC 1010™ pad (Dow Chemical). The polishing parameters were as follows: 20.68 kPa (3 psi) down force, 100 rpm platen speed, 85 rpm head speed, and 150 mL/min polishing composition flow. Following polishing, the removal rates of the blanket silicon oxide, specifically TEOS and HDP, were determined in Å/min, and the remaining TEOS step heights were determined in Å. The results are summarized in Table 1. The removal rates and remaining step heights shown in Table 1 have been normalized to the removal rates and step height for Polishing Composition 1E.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The within-wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU) was also determined for the chemical-mechanical polishing compositions as a measure of polishing uniformity. The WIWNUL is a percentage calculated by dividing the standard deviation of removal rate by the average removal rate over the substrate and multiplying by 100. The results are summarized in Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">These results demonstrate that a polishing composition comprising first abrasive particles (i.e., wet-process ceria particles having an average particle size of 60 nm) and second abrasive particles (i.e., wet-process ceria particles having an average particle size of 30 nm), and having a multimodal particle size distribution (i.e., a bimodal particle size distribution having maxima at 60 nm and 30 nm), is particularly effective for polishing substrates comprising a silicon oxide layer (i.e., TEOS and HDP). In particular, Polishing Compositions 1A and 1C exhibited blanket removal rates for TEOS and HDP which were greater than the TEOS and HDP removal rates exhibited by Polishing Compositions 1E and 1F, which contained a greater amount of abrasive particles, but did not contain second abrasive particles, and did not exhibit a multimodal particle size distribution. Each of Polishing Compositions 1A-1D also exhibited reduced WIWNU on TEOS as compared to Polishing Composition 1F, and Polishing Compositions 1A-1C exhibited reduced WIWNU on HDP as compared to Polishing Composition 1F. Polishing Compositions 1A and 1C also exhibited reduced WIWNU on TEOS as compared to Polishing Composition 1E. In addition, Polishing Compositions 1A-1C desirably removed more TEOS step height during polishing (i.e., Polishing Compositions 1A-1C had less TEOS step height remaining after polishing), even though Polishing Compositions 1A-1C had lower solids concentrations as compared to Polishing Compositions 1E and 1F (i.e., lower total concentration of abrasive particles).</div>

In particular, the substrates were polished on a Mirra™ polisher (Applied Materials) with an IC 1010™ pad (Dow Chemical). The polishing parameters were as follows: 20.68 kPa (3 psi) down force, 100 rpm platen speed, 85 rpm head speed, and 150 mL/min polishing composition flow. Following polishing, the removal rates of the blanket silicon oxide, specifically TEOS and HDP, were determined in Å/min, and the remaining TEOS step heights were determined in Å.
