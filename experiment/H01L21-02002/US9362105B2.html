<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a process for the fabrication of a semiconductor die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Miniaturization and slimming of electrical and electronic equipment has led to a need for both thinner semiconductor devices and thinner semiconductor packaging. One way to accomplish this is to thin down the wafer by removing excess material from the back side of the semiconductor wafer, typically done before the wafer is diced into individual semiconductor dies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Another solution to produce smaller and more efficient semiconductor packages is to utilize an array of metallic bumps attached to the active face of the wafer. The metallic bumps are disposed to match with bonding pads on a substrate. When the metal is reflowed to a melt, it connects with the bonding pads forming both electrical and mechanical connections. This metallic bump packaging is generally referred to as “flip chip” because the bumped semiconductors are flipped in order to be attached to their substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to a thermal mismatch that exists between the semiconductor and the substrate, repeated thermal cycling stresses the metallic interconnections, potentially leading to ultimate device failure. To counteract this, an encapsulating material, commonly called an underfill, is disposed in the gap between the semiconductor and the substrate, surrounding and supporting the metallic bumps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Current trends in semiconductor packaging fabrication favor completing as many process steps as possible at the wafer level, allowing multiple integrated circuits to be processed at the same time, rather than individually, as occurs after die singulation. However, thinned silicon semiconductor wafers are fragile, so it is a benefit to utilize processes in semiconductor fabrication that do not threaten the integrity of the wafer as it is being diced into individual semiconductor dies and that have as few steps as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One new method for dicing semiconductor wafers into individual dies is called “stealth dicing”. Stealth dicing is a dicing method in which a laser beam is irradiated to the inside of a semiconductor wafer to selected areas, thereby weakening the silicon bonds in those areas, and making it easier to divide the silicon wafer within those areas. Using stealth dicing, very thin semiconductor wafers can be cut without physically stressing the wafer, damage to the wafer is lessened, and die strength of the individual dies is not reduced. It would be an advantage to prepare a wafer for dicing so that the stealth laser dicing can be utilized.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention is a method for preparing for dicing a thinned semiconductor wafer with applied underfill, which method eliminates a step in conventional fabrication and is conducive to stealth dicing. The method comprises (a) providing a thinned semiconductor wafer having a plurality of metallic bumps on its active face and, optionally, through-silica-vias vertically through the silicon wafer; (b) providing an underfill material on a dicing support tape, in which the underfill material is precut to the shape of the semiconductor wafer; (c) aligning the underfill material on the dicing support tape with the semiconductor wafer and laminating the underfill material to the semiconductor wafer. In one embodiment of this method, a separation layer is disposed between the underfill and the dicing tape. In another embodiment, this invention is a dicing tape having an underfill material disposed on one side. In a further embodiment, a separation layer is disposed between the underfill and the dicing tape.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention is a method for the preparation of a semiconductor wafer for dicing. The semiconductor wafer has a plurality of metallic bumps on its active face. The essence of this invention is the use of a dicing tape having an underfill material disposed on one side. The dicing tape/underfill thus supplies the underfill material and the dicing tape in one step. Rather than applying an underfill material to the semiconductor wafer, and in a separate step, mounting the dicing tape over the underfill, the use of the combined dicing tape and underfill eliminates a step in the fabrication process. The assembly of dicing tape, underfill and wafer can be disposed in a dicing frame so that the inactive face of the wafer is oriented upwards, for ease in stealth dicing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The wafer is prepared according to known methods from a semiconductor material, typically silicon, gallium arsenide, germanium, or similar compound semiconductor materials. The formation of the plurality of metallic bumps on the top side of the wafer, and their metallic composition, are made according to semiconductor and metallic fabrication methods well documented in industry literature. The metallic bumps are disposed on one face of the semiconductor wafer, called the active face, to match with metal bonding pads on a substrate for the semiconductor. When the metal is reflowed to a melt, it connects with the bonding pads forming both electrical and mechanical connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Silicon-through-vias are vertical passageways extending completely through the silicon wafer for the purpose of connecting circuitry from one semiconductor wafer to another semiconductor wafer or to a substrate for the semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Dicing tapes are used in the fabrication process to support the wafer during dicing operations, that is, during the dicing of a semiconductor wafer into individual semiconductor dies. Dicing tapes are commercially available from a number of sources and in various forms can consist of a heat sensitive, pressure sensitive, or UV sensitive adhesive on a carrier. The carrier is typically a flexible substrate of polyolefin or polyimide. When heat, pulling strain, or UV is applied, respectively, the adhesiveness decreases, allowing the dicing tape to be removed. Commonly, a release liner covers the adhesive layer and can be easily removed just prior to use of the dicing tape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Protective support tapes or carriers are used in the fabrication process to protect and support the metallic bumps and active face of the wafer during the wafer thinning (or back grinding) process. In some fabrication methods, the protective support can be a glass sheet or slide, another silicon wafer, or a tape suited for back grinding. Back grinding tapes are commercially available from a number of sources and in various forms consist of a heat sensitive, pressure sensitive, or UV sensitive adhesive on a carrier. The carrier is typically a flexible substrate of polyolefin or polyimide. When heat, pulling strain, or UV is applied respectively, the adhesiveness decreases, allowing the protective support tape to be removed. Commonly, a release liner covers the adhesive layer and can be easily removed just prior to use of the protective support. The back grinding operation may be performed, for example, by mechanical grinding, laser grinding, or etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Adhesives and encapsulants suitable as underfill chemistry that can be in the form of films are known, as are methods for making the underfill films. Suitable underfill films may be prepared, for example, from epoxy, acrylate, or silicon based chemistry and hardening agents for those chemistries. The thickness of the underfill material can be adjusted so that the metallic bumps can be either completely or only partially covered after lamination. In either case, the underfill material is supplied in amount and form so that it fully fills the space between the semiconductor and the intended substrate. In practice, the underfill material will be provided on a carrier and be protected with a release liner. Thus, the underfill material will be provided in a three layer form in which the first layer is a carrier, such as a flexible polyolefin or polyimide tape, the second layer is the underfill material, and the third layer is a release liner, in that order. Just before use, the release liner is removed and the underfill is typically applied when still attached to the carrier. After application of the underfill to the wafer, the carrier is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In this invention, the underfill encapsulant is supplied on the dicing tape. The dicing tape can be in sheet form and comprises a substrate film and a pressure sensitive adhesive layer on one side of the substrate film. The underfill encapsulant, in a form precut to the size and shape of the wafer, is disposed on the dicing tape. A release liner is mounted over the underfill and is in contact with the underfill and those portions of the dicing tape not covered by the underfill (due to the precut shape of the underfill).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention is further described by reference to the Figures. In the figures, assemblies of one or more elements of dicing tape, silicon wafer, metallic bumps, underfill, and protective support can be shown with the active face of the silicon wafer (the face containing the metallic bumps) oriented up or down. The assembly can be handled in any orientation determined by the practitioner to be suitable and useful for the operation to be performed. Each of the dicing tape, back grinding tape, and underfill are shown without release liner. The dicing tape and back grinding tape are discarded after use. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that a release liner is generally used to protect the pressure sensitive adhesive of the dicing tape or back grinding tape, and that the release liner is removed just prior to use. The underfill layer laminated onto the active side of the wafer will move on to the dicing and bonding steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a prior art method for preparing a bumped semiconductor with preapplied underfill for dicing.
