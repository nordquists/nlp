<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 14/136,449, filed on Dec. 20, 2013, entitled “Uniformity in Wafer Patterning using Feedback Control,” which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to wafer patterning, and, in particular embodiments, to improved uniformity in wafer patterning using feedback control.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the manufacturing of integrated circuits, patterning techniques such as photolithography and etching are used to form various features such as polysilicon lines, devices (e.g., transistors, diodes, and the like), interconnect structures, contact pads, and the like in device dies on a wafer. As design features in integrated circuits become increasingly complex (e.g., having smaller critical dimensions and/or more complex shapes), double patterning processes may be used to form a single feature. However, due to process limitations, critical dimensions of the various patterned features may not be uniform within a device die/wafer, which may degrade the performance of the device die/wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to improve critical dimension uniformity (CDU) and within wafer (WiW) uniformity, dose mapper (DoMa) maps may be calculated for wafers to measure the actual critical dimensions of patterned features. These DoMa maps may then be used to adjust lithography conditions of the patterning process to improve CDU and WiW uniformity. However, conventional DoMa maps and applications thereof may suffer from various limitations.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The making and using of the embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the embodiments provide many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Improved uniformity in wafer patterning using feedback control is provided in accordance with an embodiment. The intermediate stages of a process flow for an embodiment are illustrated. The variations of the embodiments are then discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments will be described with respect to a specific context, namely patterning a polysilicon gate layer in a wafer using a double patterning process. Other embodiments may also be applied, however, to patterning other features in a wafer using a multiple pattern process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref> illustrate the calculation of a dose mapper (DoMa) bias map <b>206</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to determine changes in critical dimensions of features in a first wafer <b>100</b> between a first patterning and a second patterning. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of the first wafer <b>100</b> having a first device layer <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, the first device layer <b>102</b> may be a polysilicon layer disposed over a substrate (not shown) for the formation of one or more polysilicon gates in first wafer <b>100</b>. The substrate may be a bulk silicon substrate although other semiconductor materials including group III, group IV, and group V elements may also be used. Alternatively, the substrate may be a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, the first device layer <b>102</b> may be a metallization layer such as an inter-layer dielectric (ILD) or an inter-metal dielectric layer (IMD) for forming interconnect structures (e.g., metal lines and/or vias). In such embodiments, the first device layer <b>102</b> may be formed of low-k dielectric materials having k values, for example, lower than about 4.0 or even about 2.8. In yet other embodiments, the first device layer <b>102</b> may be any layer in the first wafer <b>100</b> that may be patterned using photolithography and etching processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates only one first device layer <b>102</b>, the first wafer <b>100</b> may include numerous device layers. Furthermore, the first device layer <b>102</b> may include a buffer layer (e.g., an oxide interfacial layer, not shown), an etch stop layer (e.g., a silicon nitride layer, a silicon carbide layer, or the like), or the like. A first hard mask <b>104</b> may be formed over the first device layer <b>102</b> for use as a patterning mask. The first hard mask <b>104</b> may comprise an oxide, silicon oxynitride (SiON), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), titanium nitride (TiN) or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the formation of an ashing-removable dielectric (ARD) <b>106</b> (e.g., comprising amorphous carbon, or the like), a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) <b>108</b>, and a photoresist <b>110</b> over the first hard mask <b>104</b>. The BARC <b>108</b> and the ARD <b>106</b> are formed to aid in the patterning of the first hard mask <b>104</b> with the photoresist <b>110</b>. For example, the BARC <b>108</b> helps filter reflection from underlying layers during photolithography, and ARD <b>106</b> may be used for improved critical dimension uniformity, reduced line-edge roughness, and lower risk of defect during photolithography. The photolithography process used to pattern the photoresist <b>110</b> may include, for example, exposing portions of the photoresist <b>110</b> (e.g., using ultraviolet light) and removing the exposed or unexposed portion of the photoresist <b>110</b> depending on whether a positive or negative resist is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first hard mask <b>104</b> is etched using the photoresist <b>110</b> as a patterning mask. The photoresist <b>110</b>, the BARC <b>108</b>, and first ARD <b>106</b> may then be removed, for example, using ashing and wet clean processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the first wafer <b>100</b> being then scanned by a critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> to produce a first DoMa map <b>202</b>. Critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> may use critical dimension scanning electron microscopy (CDSEM) to measure critical dimensions (e.g., pitch, width of patterned features, spacing between patterned features, or the like) of test sites on various device dies across the first wafer <b>100</b>. The number of test sites measured to produce a DoMa map such as the first DoMa map <b>202</b> may be quite large. For example, in various embodiments, the number of test sites may be five hundred or more. The first DoMa map <b>202</b> provides critical dimension measurements for features (e.g., the first hard mask <b>104</b>) in different locations of the first wafer <b>100</b> after a first patterning process (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Furthermore, the first DoMa map <b>202</b> may provide information related to critical dimension uniformity (CDU) such as mean, standard deviation, range, and the like. Although first DoMa map <b>202</b> includes specific measurements, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the actual measurements of the first DoMa map <b>202</b> (and any other DoMa map described herein) may vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> is formed over the first hard mask <b>104</b> and the first device layer <b>102</b>. The first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> includes a top photoresist layer <b>118</b>, a middle layer <b>116</b>, and a bottom layer <b>114</b>. The middle layer <b>116</b> may include anti-reflective materials (e.g., an anti-reflective coating) to aid in exposure and focus during the processing of the top photoresist layer <b>118</b>. The bottom layer <b>114</b> may comprise a hard mask material such as an ashable hard mask (e.g., amorphous carbon film or amorphous silicon film), polysilicon, or any other material that may be patterned and selectively removed without removing the first hard mask <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The top photoresist layer <b>118</b> may be patterned, for example, by exposing the top photoresist layer <b>118</b> and removing the exposed/unexposed portion. The patterning of top photoresist layer <b>118</b> forms a pattern in a different direction (e.g., orthogonal to) than the first patterning of the first hard mask <b>104</b> (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the patterning of the first hard mask <b>104</b> and the first device layer <b>102</b> using the first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> has a mask. The pattern of the top photoresist layer <b>118</b> may be transferred to the middle layer <b>116</b>, the bottom layer <b>114</b>, and the first hard mask <b>104</b>, for example, through etching. The first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> may be removed using, for example, ashing and wet cleaning processes. Subsequently, the first device layer <b>102</b> may be patterned using an etching process and the first hard mask layer <b>104</b> as a patterning mask. The etching process may be an anisotropic etching process, which may also thin the first hard mask <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, the first device layer <b>102</b> is patterned using a double patterning process. Alternatively, in embodiments with less complex patterns (e.g., having a patterning running in a single direction), the first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> may be omitted. In such embodiments, the double patterning process may include patterning the first hard mask <b>104</b> (sometimes referred to as a pre-pattern) and using the first hard mask <b>104</b> as a patterning mask to etch the first device layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The resulting first wafer <b>100</b> is scanned by the critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> to produce a second DoMa map <b>204</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> may use CDSEM to scan and measure critical dimensions of patterned first hard mask <b>104</b> and first device layer <b>102</b>. The second DoMa map <b>204</b> provides critical dimension measurements for features (e.g., the first hard mask <b>104</b>) in different locations of the first wafer after the second patterning illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Generally, the second DoMa map <b>204</b> may be taking measurements of a same pattern as the first DoMa map <b>202</b>, but the second DoMa map <b>204</b> measures the pattern after the second lithography process. For example, the first and second DoMa maps may both measure the pattern of the first hard mask <b>104</b> formed using the first lithography process (e.g., illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Furthermore, the second DoMa map <b>204</b> may provide information for gauging critical dimension uniformity (CDU) such as mean, standard deviation, range, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the calculation of a DoMa bias map <b>206</b> in accordance with various embodiments. DoMa bias map <b>206</b> is calculated by taking the difference (e.g., by taking a point to point/site to site difference) between the first DoMa map <b>202</b> and the second DoMa map <b>204</b>. Thus, the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> provides measurements of a change in critical dimensions of features in the first wafer <b>100</b> due to the second patterning process. The DoMa bias map <b>206</b> may be used in subsequent patterning processes to predict critical dimensions in a finished wafer based on a first patterning. In some embodiments, the accuracy of the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> may be checked by creating a simulated DoMa map of the second DoMa map <b>204</b> (e.g., by adding the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> to the first DOMa map <b>202</b>) and checking offset and/or correlation values (e.g., a coefficient of determination value) between the simulated DoMa map and the actual values of the second DoMa map <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 17</figref> illustrate the patterning of a second wafer <b>300</b> using the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> as feedback for improving CDU, within wafer (WiW) uniformity, wafer to wafer (W2W) uniformity, lot to lot (L2L, sometimes referred to run to run) uniformity, device performance uniformity (e.g., saturation current uniformity), and/or the like. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the second wafer <b>300</b>. The second wafer <b>300</b> maybe substantially similar to the first wafer <b>100</b>, and similar reference numerals indicate like features. For example, the second wafer <b>300</b> includes a second device layer <b>302</b> and a second hard mask <b>304</b>, which may be substantially similar to the first device layer <b>102</b> and the first hard mask <b>104</b>, respectively. As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the second hard mask <b>304</b> may be patterned (e.g., using photolithography and etching) to have a same pattern as the first patterning of the first hard mask <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the calculation of a third DoMa map <b>208</b> by measuring critical dimensions across the second wafer <b>300</b> using critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b>. Critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> may use CDSEM to scan and measure critical dimensions of test sites across the second wafer <b>300</b>. These test sites may be located at the same location as the first wafer <b>100</b>. Therefore, the third DoMa map <b>208</b> measures similar dimensions and locations as the first DoMa map <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> is calculated by adding the third DoMa map <b>208</b> and the DoMa bias map <b>206</b>. For example, the third DoMa map <b>208</b> and the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> may be added on a point-by-point basis for all points (e.g., within wafer and/or within field) on the third DoMa map <b>208</b> and the DoMa map <b>206</b>. Alternatively, the third DoMa map <b>208</b> and the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> may be added on a point-by-point basis for as subset (e.g., any percentage) of measured points across the wafer. The simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> predicts the critical dimension of features in the second wafer <b>300</b> after a second patterning process based on the actual critical dimensions of the first patterning process and feedback from patterning a previous wafer (e.g., the DoMa bias map <b>206</b>). Critical dimensions in the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> may then be compared against target critical dimensions for the wafer (e.g., critical dimension set by the design of the wafer) to fine tune the first patterning of the second wafer <b>300</b> and/or to select process conditions for second patterning process of the second wafer <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> indicated critical dimensions CD<b>1</b> that were too small in the second wafer <b>300</b>. In such embodiments, a coating layer <b>320</b> may be added to features (e.g., second hard mask <b>304</b>) of the second wafer <b>300</b> to enlarge the relevant critical dimension CD<b>1</b>, to a more desirable critical dimension CD<b>2</b>. The coating layer <b>320</b> may be formed using any suitable deposition process, for example, using a process gas such as SiCl<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiH<sub>x</sub>, a polymer gas, or the like to form coating layer <b>320</b> sidewalls of the second hard mask <b>306</b>. Other deposition methods may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> indicated critical dimensions CD <b>1</b> that are too large in the second wafer <b>300</b>. In such embodiments, a fine tuning etch process may be applied to the second hard mask <b>306</b> in the second wafer <b>300</b> to reduce the critical dimension CD<b>1</b>, to a more desirable critical dimension CD<b>3</b>. The expansion and reduction of features in the second wafer <b>300</b> may be performed in separate alternatives or in combination. For example, various features in portions of the second wafer <b>300</b> may be enlarged while other features in other portions of the second wafer <b>300</b> may be reduced to achieve desired critical dimensions. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> illustrate changing critical dimensions of the second hard mask <b>306</b>, various embodiments may include fine tuning critical dimensions of other features in the second wafer <b>300</b> such as the spacing between the second hard mask <b>306</b>, and/or the like. Furthermore, critical dimensions may be fine-tuned across the entirety of the second wafer <b>300</b> or a portion of the second wafer <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a fourth DoMa map <b>212</b> may be optionally calculated by measuring critical dimensions across the second wafer <b>300</b> after fine tuning using critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> (e.g., by using CDSEM to scan and measure critical dimensions of test sites across the second wafer <b>300</b>). The fourth DoMa map <b>212</b> provides critical dimension information of the second wafer <b>300</b> after fine tuning of the first patterning based on the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b>. In subsequent process steps, the fourth DoMa map <b>212</b> may be used to update the DoMa bias map <b>206</b> for patterning subsequent wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the formation of a second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b> over the second hard mask <b>304</b> and the second device layer <b>302</b>. The second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b> may be substantially similar to the first tri-layer photoresist <b>112</b> and may include a top photoresist layer, a middle layer, and a bottom layer. In various embodiments, the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> may be used to adjust photolithography conditions for patterning the second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b>. Generally, the critical dimensions of a pattern have a linear relationship with strength of the exposure dosage during photolithography. Thus, by adjusting the exposure dosage used to pattern the second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b>, critical dimensions of the patterned photoresist may be adjusted to compensate for differences between the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> and desired critical dimensions of the second wafer <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an etching chamber <b>400</b> for etching the second hard mask <b>304</b> and the second device layer <b>302</b> using the second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b> as a patterning mask. The etching chamber <b>400</b> includes a radio frequency (RF) power generator <b>402</b>, a power controller <b>404</b>, RF coils <b>406</b>, a tunable gas injector <b>408</b>, a top electrode <b>410</b>, a tunable electrostatic chuck (ESC) <b>412</b>, a temperature control module <b>414</b>, and a ESC power generator <b>416</b>. The power controller <b>404</b> helps stabilize and control a power level supplied by the RF power generator <b>402</b> to RF coils <b>406</b>. Alternatively RF power generator <b>402</b> may be replaced with a different power source such as a microwave power source or any applicable plasma/radical generated power source. The RF power generator <b>402</b>, the RF coils <b>406</b>, the top electrode <b>410</b>, and the tunable ESC <b>412</b> generates an RF electromagnetic field while the tunable gas injector <b>408</b> supplies a process gas (e.g., a fluorocarbon) into the etching chamber <b>400</b>. The second wafer <b>300</b> may be placed on the tunable electrostatic chuck (ESC) <b>412</b>. The RF electromagnetic field converts the process gas between the top electrode <b>410</b> and the tunable ESC <b>412</b> into plasma for etching the second wafer <b>300</b>. Other configurations of etching chamber <b>400</b> may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Differences between the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> and desired critical dimensions of the second wafer <b>300</b> may be used to adjust the process conditions of etching chamber <b>400</b>. For example, the tunable gas injector <b>408</b> may control gas flow speed and distribution location of gas flow into the etching chamber <b>400</b>. Generally, increased gas flow speed increases etching times and the amount of material removed. The tunable gas injector <b>408</b> may control the gas flow speed over different areas the second wafer <b>300</b> during etching to achieve desired critical dimensions. For example, the simulated DoMa map may indicate critical dimensions that are too large in a section of the second wafer <b>300</b>, and the tunable gas injector <b>408</b> may alter the gas flow to the section accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As another example, the bias power (e.g., using ESC power generator <b>416</b>) and/or the temperature (e.g., using temperature control module <b>414</b>) may be adjusted based on differences between the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> and desired critical dimensions. Generally, a higher bias power and a higher temperature increase the etching rate and amount etched, whereas a lower bias power and a lower temperature decrease the etching rate and the amount etched. The ESC power generator <b>416</b> may be used to adjust the bias power applied to the tunable ESC <b>412</b> during etching to achieve desired critical dimensions. The temperature control module <b>414</b> may adjust the temperature of the tunable ESC <b>412</b>, for example, by partitioning the tunable ESC <b>412</b> into different zones (e.g., inner zone <b>412</b>A, middle zone <b>412</b>B, intermediate zone <b>412</b>C, and outer zone <b>412</b>D of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>) and heating and/or cooling the different zones to increase/decrease etch rates and adjust the critical dimensions of the second wafer <b>300</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> illustrates tunable ESC <b>412</b> as having four zones, the tunable ESC <b>412</b> may have any number of zones in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, by adjusting the etching chamber parameters (e.g., gas flow rate, gas flow distribution, temperature of the ESC <b>412</b>, and/or the bias power of the ESC <b>412</b>) allows for different critical dimensions to be formed during etching. These etching chamber parameters may be adjusted in accordance with differences between the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> and desired critical dimensions to improve CDU, WiW uniformity, L2L uniformity, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the resulting second wafer <b>300</b> after a second patterning process using the second tri-layer photoresist <b>312</b> as a patterning mask and adjusted etching parameters. The second tri-layer photoresist may then be removed. The resulting second wafer <b>300</b> may have improved CDU, WiW uniformity, or the like due to the use of the simulated DoMa map <b>210</b> to fine tune the first patterning of the second wafer <b>300</b> (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>), adjust lithography conditions (e.g., exposure dosage) of the second patterning process (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), and/or adjust the etching parameters (e.g., controlling gas flow rate, gas flow distribution, temperature, and/or bias power) of the second patterning (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequently, as illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a fifth DoMa map <b>214</b> may be calculated by the critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> to include critical dimensions of the patterned second wafer <b>300</b>. The fifth DoMa map <b>214</b> map may be used to update the bias map <b>206</b> to improve the accuracy of simulated DoMa maps in subsequent patternings. For example the fifth DoMa map <b>214</b> map may be compared to a desired DoMa map (e.g., having desired critical dimensions based on the design of wafers <b>100</b> and <b>300</b>). Any differences between the fifth DoMa map <b>214</b> and the desired DoMa map may be used to update the bias map <b>206</b>, for example, by adding calculated differences to the bias map <b>206</b> on a point-by-point basis for all points or a subset of points (e.g., between 0% and 100% of points). In another embodiment, differences between the fifth DoMa map <b>214</b> and the fourth DoMa map <b>212</b> (please refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) are calculated to form a second bias map. The bias map <b>206</b> may be updated using the second bias map (e.g., the bias maps may be averaged) for generating more robust simulated DoMa maps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, various embodiments calculate a bias map from a first double patterning process of a first wafer. The bias map may be used to improve critical dimensions of other subsequent wafers during patterning. For example, the bias map may be used to calculate a simulated DoMa map for each wafer after a first patterning. This simulated DoMa map may be compared against desired critical dimensions for fine tuning a first patterning, adjusting lithography conditions, and/or adjusting etching conditions during a second patterning. Thus, through feedback, CDU, WiW uniformity, L2L uniformity, and the like may be improved. After each wafer is patterned, a DoMa map may be calculated to update the bias map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, while critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> is only discussed as being used to generate DoMa maps, in various embodiments critical dimension scanning module <b>200</b> may be used to measure sample critical dimensions after any patterning step (e.g., after lithography and/or etching step) for feedback control. For example, the CD scanning module may measure about a dozen test sites in the wafer after a patterning step using CDSEM and/or optical spectrum measurements. These select CD measurements may then be fed back to the patterning device (e.g., the lithography device and/or etching chamber <b>400</b>) to adjust patterning process conditions of a subsequent wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a process flow <b>500</b> for calculating a bias map in accordance with various embodiments. In step <b>502</b>, a wafer (e.g., first wafer <b>100</b>) is patterned with a first patterning process, for example, using photolithography and etching. In step <b>504</b>, a DoMa map of the first pattern is generated for the wafer. The DoMa map of the first pattern may be generated by a critical dimension scanning module using CDESM to measure test sites on device dies in the wafer. The number of test sites may be quite large (e.g., five hundred or more), and the DoMa map may be able to generate accurate and location-specific critical dimension measurements of the features of the wafer after the first patterning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, in step <b>506</b>, a second patterning process is performed on the wafer. The second patterning process may include photolithography and etching to create more complex patterns (e.g., running a different direction than the first pattern). Alternatively, the second patterning process may be an etching process, for example, to transfer a hard mask patterned in the first patterning process to an underlying device layer. In step <b>508</b>, a DoMa map of the second pattern is generated for the wafer, for example, using a critical dimension scanning module and CDESM. The DoMa map of the second patterning process provides location-specific critical dimension measurements of features of the wafer after the second patterning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>510</b>, the bias map is calculated from the DoMa maps of the first and second patterns. For example, the bias map may be calculated by taking a difference of the DoMa maps. Thus, the bias map is a DoMa map that measures a change in critical dimensions in the wafer between the first and second patterning processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a process flow <b>600</b> for calculating a bias map in accordance with various embodiments. In step <b>602</b>, a wafer (e.g., second wafer <b>300</b>) is patterned with a first patterning process, for example, using photolithography and etching. In step <b>604</b>, a DoMa map of the first pattern is generated for the wafer. The DoMa map of the first pattern may be generated by a critical dimension scanning module using CDESM to measure test sites on device dies in the wafer. The number of test sites may be quite large (e.g., five hundred or more), and the DoMa map may be able to generate accurate and location-specific critical dimension measurements of the features of the wafer after the first patterning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>606</b>, a simulated DoMa map of a second pattern is calculated. The simulated DoMa map may be calculated by adding the DoMap map of the first pattern to a bias map. The bias map may be calculated from patterning a previous wafer, for example, using the process illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The bias map may provide measurements of changes in critical dimensions in the previous wafer between a first and a second patterning process. The simulated DoMa map predicts critical dimensions of the wafer after a second patterning based on critical dimensions of wafer after the first patterning and the bias map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, in step <b>608</b>, the simulated DoMa map is compared to a desired DoMa map. The desired DoMa map may include desired critical dimensions of the wafer based on the design of the wafer. Based on differences between the simulated DoMa map and the desired DoMa map, steps <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> may be performed to improve CDU, WiW uniformity, and the like. For example, in step <b>610</b>, the first pattern may be fine-tuned by expanding/contracting certain features in the wafer. Expanding features in the wafer may be performed by depositing a coating layer on the features while contracting features in the wafer may be performed by performing additional etching. In step <b>612</b>, a second patterning is performed on the wafer. The second patterning process may include a combination of photolithography and etching. In an embodiment, lithography process conditions for the second patterning may be adjusted to achieve desired critical dimensions, for example, by adjusting the exposure dosage. In another embodiment, etching process parameters for the second patterning may be adjusted. For example, gas flow rate, gas flow distribution, temperature, and/or bias power of the second etching process may be adapted to achieve desired critical dimensions. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that fine-tuning the first pattern, adjusting lithography conditions, and adjusting etching parameters may be performed individually or in combination based on differences between the simulated DoMa map and the desired DoMa map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>614</b>, the bias map may be updated. For example, a DoMa map of the second pattern may be generated for the wafer. A new bias map for the wafer may be generated from the DoMa map of the second pattern and a DoMa map calculated after fine tuning the first pattern (step <b>610</b>). The two bias maps may then be averaged. In an alternative embodiment, the DoMa map of the second pattern may be compared with the desired DoMa map, and any differences may be used to update the bias map. Then, the process may be repeated from step <b>602</b> to pattern a subsequent wafer using the updated bias map.</div>
