<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a composite substrate suited for semiconductor device fabrication, comprising an inorganic insulating sintered body having a high heat conductivity, typically silicon nitride, and a single crystal semiconductor film, typically silicon thin film, formed on its surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, silicon base semiconductor devices are increasingly improved in performance as their design rule is miniaturized. It is then critical how to dissipate heat from discrete transistors and metal interconnects between transistors. To address the problem, several measures are taken wherein after device fabrication, the silicon substrate on the back surface is thinned to one to several hundreds of microns, and a large fan is mounted on the chip to promote heat dissipation, or a water-cooled tube is arranged therearound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">However, even when the silicon substrate is actually thinned, the region where the device is fabricated extends several microns from the surface, and the remaining region serves as a heat sump and remains less efficient from the aspect of heat dissipation. Also, SOI wafers used in high-performance processors or the like have the structure including an insulating layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>interposed immediately below a device active layer, which structure raises a serious problem from the aspect of heat dissipation because SiO<sub>2 </sub>has a low heat conductivity of 1.38 W/m·K. Further, silicon substrates suffer a substantial loss in the high-frequency region due to their dielectric properties, with their use being limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) technology using sapphire substrate is considered attractive because of efficient heat conduction and low losses in the high-frequency region, but suffers from the following problems. One problem is that since the sapphire substrate is transparent in the visible light region, it is not detected by the optical sensor used for the confirmation of a substrate or for the alignment of a wafer during the device fabrication process. Another problem is that sapphire substrates are expensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Exemplary of the substrate which is opaque to visible light, heat conductive and inexpensive are sintered ceramic bodies such as silicon nitride and aluminum nitride. Since these materials are obtained by sintering silicon nitride or aluminum nitride powder together with sintering aids, metal impurities like Fe and Al in the powder or sintering aids like alumina themselves become a cause of contamination to the device fabrication process. These materials are thus awkward to use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is noted that Patent Document 1 (JP-A H04-82256) discloses a substrate having a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film deposited thereon by CVD method for the purposes of insulation and anti-contamination. No reference is made to volume resistivity.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the construction of a composite substrate according to one embodiment of the invention.</div>
</description-of-drawings>
<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0020">The substrate used in the practice of the invention is an inorganic insulating sintered body having a heat conductivity which is preferably higher than the heat conductivity (1.5 W/m·K) of SiO<sub>2</sub>, more preferably at least 5 W/m·K, and even more preferably at least 10 W/m·K. The heat conductivity is typically up to 2,500 W/m·K, especially up to 2,000 W/m·K although its upper limit is not critical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0021">To suppress a power loss due to dielectric properties, the substrate should desirably have a volume resistivity as high as possible, preferably at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>Ω·cm, and more preferably at least 1×10<sup>10 </sup>Ω·cm. The volume resistivity is typically up to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>Ω·cm, especially up to 1×10<sup>16 </sup>Ω·cm although its upper limit is not critical. Exemplary of the inorganic insulating sintered body meeting these requirements are sintered bodies of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, SiAlON (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0022">Among these, silicon nitride is most preferred because of high resistance to chemical liquids used in the device fabrication process and a low cost of substrate formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0023">It is noted that the substrate preferably has a thickness of 100 to 2,000 μm, more preferably 200 to 1,000 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0024">Sometimes the sintered body contains metal elements such as Fe and Al, typically much Al, with a likelihood that such metal elements may exert detrimental effects when leached out or diffused during the device fabrication process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0025">In this regard, provided that the impurity concentration in a substrate is analyzed by the ICP-MS method, if the Fe concentration is up to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the Al concentration is up to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, then a single crystal semiconductor film can be formed directly on the substrate surface. If the Fe concentration is from more than the indicated value to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the Al concentration is from more than the indicated value to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, then the substrate in its entirety is preferably covered with a thin film of oxide, nitride or oxynitride in order to prevent these impurities from leaching out. Of course, it is recommended to form such a thin film even when the Fe concentration is up to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the Al concentration is up to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. A single crystal semiconductor film where a device is to be formed, specifically a single crystal silicon film is formed on the substrate via the thin film, yielding the desired composite substrate. It is preferred that the thin film be formed so as to cover the substrate in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0026">Since the thin film of oxide, nitride or oxynitride is intended to prevent metal impurities in the substrate from leaching out or diffusing, the thin film must be of high purity. To this end, means for forming such films is preferably sputtering, electron beam evaporation or chemical vapor deposition. Using such means, the concentration of Al or Fe in the film can be set below the concentration in the sintered body, typically up to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably up to 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and more preferably up to 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is effective for suppressing contamination with metal impurities from within the substrate. The thin film preferably has a volume resistivity of 1×10<sup>8 </sup>to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>Ω·cm, and more preferably 1×10<sup>10 </sup>to 1×10<sup>16 </sup>Ω·cm and a heat conductivity of 2 to 100 W/m·K, and more preferably 5 to 50 W/m·K. Exemplary of the film species are insulating films of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>and SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y </sub>(wherein 0&lt;x&lt;2 and 0&lt;y&lt;1.3) which can be formed to a high purity by the above-mentioned means. Inter alia, silicon nitride is most preferred when it is taken into account to maintain the high heat conductivity of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0027">It is noted that the thin film preferably has a thickness of 0.01 to 50 μm, more preferably 0.1 to 20 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0028">Also, the single crystal semiconductor film formed on the substrate surface directly or via the thin film may be a single crystal silicon film. In most cases, the semiconductor film is preferably formed to a thickness of 0.01 to 100 μm, more preferably 0.05 to 1 μm. The methods for forming the single crystal semiconductor film include a method of bonding a substrate having hydrogen or rare gas ions implanted therein, flaking and transferring the implanted layer, like Smart-Cut method, and a method of bonding a semiconductor layer of Si or SOI and thinning by mechanical and/or chemical means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0029">Also, while the substrate is held by an electrostatic chuck as a general practice in the device fabrication process, it is difficult to hold silicon nitride by the electrostatic chuck because the silicon nitride itself is insulating. Therefore, the back side of the substrate must be made electroconductive or semi-conductive. This state can be established by a silicon film which allows for holding by an electrostatic chuck and eliminates the concern of contamination to the device fabrication line, while the silicon film may be embodied as a single crystal silicon film, polycrystalline silicon film or amorphous silicon film. The silicon film preferably has a thickness of 0.01 to 100 μm, more preferably 0.05 to 10 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0030">The composite substrate of the invention is mainly used in the fabrication of power devices with substantial heat generation and RF devices using high frequency.</div>
