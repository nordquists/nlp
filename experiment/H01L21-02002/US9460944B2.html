<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a substrate treatment technique of treating a substrate by supplying a substrate with a treatment solution while rotating the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As such a substrate treatment technique, Japanese Patent No. 5123122 discloses a substrate treating apparatus that supplies a fluid, preliminarily subjected to temperature control, to a large number of points between the central portion and the edge portion of the substrate and emits a treatment solution to the upper surface of the substrate, thereby treating the substrate. The apparatus includes temperature control units individually controlling the temperatures of the fluids supplied from a large number of points below the substrate. Each fluid is individually subjected to temperature control by a corresponding temperature control unit such that the temperature of the fluid increases as the position of the substrate, which is supplied with the fluid, approaches the edge portion from the central portion of the substrate. This allows the apparatus to reduce a temperature difference of the substrate arising from a difference in the circumferential velocity between the central portion and the edge portion of the substrate, thereby uniformizing the substrate treatments with a treatment solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open. No. 2012-151439 discloses a substrate treating apparatus including an upper nozzle and a rod-shaped lower nozzle. The upper nozzle is caused to scan the portion between the central section and the peripheral section of the substrate above a circular substrate that rotates in a horizontal plane. The lower nozzle is extended from below the central section of the substrate to below the peripheral section thereof. The upper nozzle includes a nozzle capable of discharging a chemical solution such as a dilute hydrofluoric acid to the upper surface of the substrate and a nozzle capable of discharging pure water or a rinse solution such as a mixed fluid of pure water and an inert gas to the upper surface of the substrate. The lower nozzle includes a large number of discharge ports that face the lower surface of the substrate and are capable of discharging the rinse solution to the lower surface of the substrate. The apparatus first discharges a chemical solution to the substrate from the upper and lower nozzles to perform a treatment with a chemical solution (chemical solution treatment). Subsequently, the apparatus performs a rinsing treatment by discharging a rinse solution from the nozzles, and then, rotates the substrate at high speed to perform a drying treatment of drying the substrate by draining out the liquid adhering to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">An airflow cutting across the lower nozzle and flowing in the direction of rotation of the substrate is formed below the substrate. The cross-section of the lower nozzle in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction of the substrate has a wing shape. More specifically, the lower surface of the lower nozzle is a horizontal surface extending in the radial direction of the substrate. The lower nozzle further includes an upper surface, which is extended parallel to the lower surface and is narrower than the lower surface, an upstream connecting surface that connects the ends upstream in the airflow in the width directions of the upper and lower surfaces, and a downstream connecting surface that connects the ends downstream in the airflow. The upstream connecting surface is much wider and has a gentler slope than the downstream connecting surface. The upstream connecting surface is curved while being recessed to the inside of the lower nozzle, whereas the downstream connecting surface is curved while projecting to the outside of the lower nozzle. The airflow generated through the rotation of the substrate is rectified to impinge upon the lower nozzle and then travel toward the lower surface of the substrate along the upstream connecting surface. In this case, the flow rate also increases thanks to the diaphragm effect. The chemical solution and the rinse solution, discharged from the lower nozzle to the lower surface of the substrate in the chemical solution treatment and the rinsing treatment, are diffused smoothly along the lower surface of the substrate through the airflow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a general substrate treating apparatus, the treatment amount (such as an etching amount) in the thickness direction of the substrate varies greatly due to, for example, a change of about 0.1° C. to 0.2° C. in substrate temperature (treatment temperature). The substrate treating apparatus of Japanese Patent No. 5123122 has a problem: the apparatus has difficulty in achieving a desired treatment amount because the substrate temperature varies due to a temperature difference between the treatment solution emitted to the upper surface of the substrate and the fluid supplied to the lower surface of the substrate. For the above-mentioned substrate treating apparatus, the treatment amount such as an etching amount with a treatment solution may not be uniformized unless the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate is made non-uniform, depending on the quality of a film formed on the substrate or the presence or absence of scanning at a treatment solution supply position. The substrate treating apparatus of Japanese Patent No. 5123122, however, has another problem: the apparatus performs temperature control for reducing a temperature difference between the central portion and the edge portion of the substrate, and thus, has difficulty in uniformizing the substrate treatment depending on the substrate treatment conditions. Further, the substrate treating apparatus suffers from an increasing apparatus manufacturing cost associated with an increased number of temperature control units, complicating temperature control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In the substrate treating apparatus of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2012-151439, the downstream connecting surface of the lower nozzle has a steep gradient, which makes it difficult for the airflow along the upstream connecting surface of the lower nozzle toward the lower surface of the substrate to flow along the downstream connecting surface after passing through the upper surface of the lower nozzle. For this reason, also after the draining treatment, the liquid such as the rinse solution adhering to the downstream connecting surface of the lower nozzle is not thoroughly drained out to be left. The remaining solution causes a problem: it triggers a watermark or particle when the treatment is performed with a different chemical solution or when another substrate is treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The substrate treating apparatus of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2012-151439 needs to fix a one-end portion of the lower nozzle, which is below the central section of the substrate, and a support member, which is inserted through a cylindrical rotating spindle of a spin chuck holding the substrate, with screws or the like. In the one-end portion of the lower nozzle is provided a structure for fixing with a screw or the like. This allows the chemical solution to be easily left in the lower nozzle, particularly in the one-end portion, after the rinsing treatment. As a result, in the case where, for example, a plurality of chemical solutions are used in combination in the chemical solution treatment and the rinsing treatment in order, the action of a new chemical solution is damaged due to the remaining chemical solution.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to a substrate treating apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The substrate treating apparatus according to one aspect of the present invention includes: a rotating and holding unit that rotates a substrate while horizontally holding the substrate; a first supply source that supplies first pure water having a first temperature; a second supply source that supplies second pure water having a second temperature higher than the first temperature; a pipe system that guides the first pure water by dividing the first pure water into one first pure water and the other first pure water; a treatment solution supply unit that is supplied with the one first pure water from the pipe system and supplies a treatment solution to a central section of an upper surface of the substrate, the treatment solution containing the one first pure water and a chemical solution mixed so as to mainly contain the one first pure water; a first supply unit that is supplied with the other first pure water from the pipe system and supplies a first liquid mainly containing the other first pure water to a central section of a lower surface of the substrate; a second supply unit that supplies a second liquid mainly containing the second pure water supplied from the second supply source to a peripheral section of the lower surface of the substrate and to an intermediate section of the lower surface between the peripheral section and the central section; and a heat amount control unit that independently controls an amount of heat to be supplied to the substrate by the first supply unit and an amount of heat to be supplied to the substrate by the second supply unit such that a temperature distribution in a radial direction of the substrate is changeable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In the apparatus, the treatment solution and the first liquid supplied to the upper surface and the lower surface, respectively, of the central section of the substrate mainly contain the first pure water supplied from a common supply source. This reduces a temperature difference between the treatment solution and the first liquid, causing the central section of the substrate to easily reach a temperature according to a desired treatment amount in the thickness direction of the substrate. Also, the rotation of the substrate enables a supply of the second liquid mainly containing the second pure water having a temperature higher than that of the first pure water to the peripheral section and the intermediate section of the substrate in which temperature is more likely to drop than in the central section. This more easily uniformizes the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate. Further, if the obtained temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate is not uniform, an amount of heat to be supplied to the central section of the lower surface of the substrate through the first liquid and an amount of heat to be supplied to the intermediate section and the peripheral section of the lower surface of the substrate through the second liquid are independently controlled, changing the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate. A difference between a desired treatment amount and an actual amount and variations in treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate can be reduced at low cost through control of the amount of heat supplied from two systems, namely, a supply system for the first liquid and a supply system for the second liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is also directed to a method of treating a substrate. This method includes steps corresponding to the operations of the substrate treating apparatus described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The substrate treating apparatus according to another aspect of the present invention includes: a rotating and holding unit that rotates a substrate while horizontally holding the substrate; and a lower nozzle that is extended, between the lower surface of the substrate and the rotating and holding unit, from below the central portion of the substrate to below the edge portion of the substrate while having a flat rod shape with a small thickness in a direction perpendicular to the lower surface of the substrate, the lower nozzle discharging the liquid to the lower surface of the substrate. The lower nozzle includes: a downstream end in a direction of rotation of the substrate; an upstream end in the direction of rotation; and a central portion having a horizontal upper surface and a horizontal lower surface and being connected to the downstream end and the upstream end. The downstream end of the lower nozzle is provided with a thin wall portion that becomes thinner as being located more downstream in the direction of rotation with a slope gradient gentler than that of the upstream end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the apparatus, the thin wall portion provided at the downstream end of the lower nozzle in the direction of rotation of the substrate has a thinner wall as it is more downstream in the direction of rotation with a slope gradient gentler than that of the end upstream in the direction of rotation. The airflow formed through the rotation of the substrate is more likely to flow along the surface of the thin wall portion after flowing along the upper surface and the lower surface of the lower nozzle, reducing a liquid remaining in the nozzle surface after the draining treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is also directed to a method of treating a substrate by a substrate treating apparatus. The substrate treating apparatus includes a rotating and holding unit configured to rotate a substrate while horizontally holding the substrate, and a lower nozzle configured to discharge a predetermined liquid to a lower surface of the substrate. The lower nozzle includes a proximal portion facing a central section of the lower surface of the substrate held by the rotating and holding unit, and an extended portion extended from the proximal portion to below a peripheral section of the lower surface of the substrate. The proximal portion of the lower nozzle includes a central discharge port that faces the central section of the lower surface of the substrate and is configured to discharge the liquid to the central section, and the extended portion of the lower nozzle includes a peripheral discharge port that faces an edge area of the lower surface of the substrate other than the central section and is configured to discharge the liquid to the edge area. The method of treating a substrate includes: a rotating and holding step of rotating the substrate while horizontally holding the substrate by the rotating and holding unit; a chemical solution treating step of, concurrently with the rotating and holding step, discharging a treatment solution containing a chemical solution from the lower nozzle to the lower surface of the substrate, to thereby treat the substrate; and a lower nozzle cleaning step of, after the chemical solution treating step, discharging a rinse solution at a first flow rate from the central discharge port of the lower nozzle to the central section of the lower surface of the substrate while discharging a rinse solution at a second flow rate higher than the first flow rate from the peripheral discharge port to the edge area of the lower surface of the substrate, to thereby supply the rinse solutions to the proximal portion of the lower nozzle to clean the proximal portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the method, the rinse solution at the first flow rate is discharged to the central section of the lower surface of the substrate from the central discharge port provided at the proximal portion of the lower nozzle, while the rinse solution at the second flow rate is discharged to the edge area of the lower surface of the substrate from the peripheral discharge port. The rinse solution discharged to the lower surface of the substrate from the lower nozzle spreads along the lower surface of the substrate, and then, falls from the lower surface of the substrate to be supplied to the lower nozzle. The rinse solution discharged to the lower surface of the substrate spreads farther along the lower surface of the substrate with a higher flow rate. The peripheral discharge port, which is farther from the proximal portion of the lower nozzle than the central discharge port, has the second flow rate higher than the first flow rate. Thus, the rinse solutions, namely, the rinse solution that is discharged from the central discharge port and spreads along the lower surface of the substrate and the rinse solution that is discharged from the peripheral discharge port and spreads along the lower surface of the substrate, collide with each other in the portion of the lower surface of the substrate, which is above or near the proximal portion of the lower nozzle and then fall to the lower nozzle together, if the flow rates of those rinse solutions are increased. This enables a supply of much of the rinse solutions to the proximal portion of the lower nozzle. Therefore, the chemical solution remaining in the proximal portion of the lower nozzle can be sufficiently replaced with the rinse solution, reducing a chemical solution remaining in the proximal portion of the lower nozzle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention therefore has an object to provide a technique of reducing a difference between a desired treatment amount and an actual treatment amount of a substrate and variations in treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate at low cost. The present invention has another object to provide a technique of reducing, in a substrate treating apparatus including a rod-shaped lower nozzle that discharges a liquid to a lower surface of a substrate, a liquid remaining on a surface of the lower nozzle after the draining processing. The present invention has still another object to provide a technique of reducing, in a substrate treating apparatus including a rod-shaped lower nozzle that discharges, for example, a chemical solution to a lower surface of a substrate, a chemical solution remaining in a one-end portion (proximal portion) of the lower nozzle, which is below a central section of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b> treats a substrate with a treatment solution containing a chemical solution (“chemical solution treatment”). Specifically, the substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b> etches an upper surface (also referred to as a “front surface”) S<b>1</b> of a substrate W such as a semiconductor wafer using, for example, an etching solution as a treatment solution, thereby removing a thin film (waste material) formed on the upper surface S<b>1</b>. Alternatively, the treatment solution may be, for example, a cleaning solution. A lower surface S<b>2</b> opposite the upper surface S<b>1</b> is also referred to as a “rear surface.” The front surface of the substrate W has a substantially circular shape, and the upper surface S<b>1</b> of the substrate W is a device forming surface on which a device pattern is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b> includes a spin chuck (“rotating and holding unit”) <b>111</b> that holds the substrate W in a substantially horizontal position and rotates the substrate W, with the upper surface S<b>1</b> facing upward. The spin chuck <b>111</b> has a cylindrical-shaped rotating spindle <b>113</b> connected to the rotation axis of a chuck rotating mechanism (“rotary unit”) <b>156</b> including a motor and is capable of rotating about a rotation axis (vertical axis) a<b>1</b>, that is, in a substantially horizontal plane, through driving of the chuck rotating mechanism <b>156</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">To the upper end of the rotating spindle <b>113</b>, a disc-shaped spin base <b>115</b> is integrally connected using a fastening component such as a screw. Thus, the operation of the chuck rotating mechanism <b>156</b> in response to a motion command from a control unit <b>161</b> that controls the entire apparatus causes the rotating spindle <b>113</b> and the spin base <b>115</b> to integrally rotate about the rotation axis a<b>1</b>. The control unit <b>161</b> also controls the chuck rotating mechanism <b>156</b> to adjust a rotational speed. The control unit <b>161</b> is enabled by, for example, a CPU executing a program stored in a memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the vicinity of the edge portion of the spin base <b>115</b>, a plurality of chuck pins <b>117</b> for gripping an edge portion S<b>3</b> of the substrate W are provided in a standing manner. It suffices that three or more chuck pins <b>117</b> are provided to reliably hold the circular substrate W, which are arranged at equal angular intervals along the edge portion of the spin base <b>115</b>. Each chuck pin <b>117</b> includes a substrate supporter and an edge holder. The substrate supporter supports the edge portion S<b>3</b> of the substrate W from below. The edge holder presses the edge portion S<b>3</b>, supported by the substrate supporter, toward the center of the substrate W from the side to hold the substrate W. Each chuck pin <b>117</b> is configured to switch between a pressing state in which the edge holder presses the edge portion S<b>3</b> of the substrate W and a release state in which the edge holder is apart from the edge portion S<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b> brings the plurality of chuck pins <b>117</b> to the release state when the substrate W is passed to the spin base <b>115</b> and brings the plurality of chuck pins <b>117</b> to the pressing state when the substrate W is, for example, etched or cleaned. When being brought to the pressing state, the plurality of chuck pins <b>117</b> can grip the edge portion S<b>3</b> of the substrate W to hold the substrate W in a substantially horizontal position with a predetermined distance from the spin base <b>115</b>. This allows the substrate W to be supported with the surface (pattern forming surface) S<b>1</b> facing upward and the lower surface S<b>2</b> facing downward, so that the rotation axis a<b>1</b> passes through the centers of the upper surface S<b>1</b> and the lower surface S<b>2</b>.</div>

The liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in this state are represented as liquids <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, respectively. If the upper nozzle <b>120</b> is positioned above the peripheral section of the substrate W, the flow rate control unit <b>163</b> reduces the flow rate of the liquid <b>52</b> discharged to the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b> more than the flow rate of the liquid <b>51</b> discharged to the central section K<b>1</b>. The liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in this state are represented as liquids <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. This achieves, also in the scanning by the upper nozzle <b>120</b>, the temperature distribution capable of reducing variations in treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">In the substrate treating apparatus according to the first embodiment configured as described above, the treatment solution <b>53</b> and the liquid <b>51</b> supplied to the upper surface and the lower surface, respectively, of the central section of the substrate W mainly contain the pure water <b>11</b> supplied from the common pure water supply source <b>131</b>. The substrate treating apparatus can accordingly reduce a temperature difference between the treatment solution <b>53</b> and the liquid <b>51</b> to cause the central section of the substrate W to easily approach the temperature according to a desired treatment amount in the thickness direction of the substrate W. For equal treatment time of the respective portions of the substrate, the final treatment amount of each portion is proportional to the treatment amount at each portion per unit time. Additionally, the substrate treating apparatus supplies, through the rotation of the substrate W, the liquid <b>52</b> mainly containing the pure water <b>12</b> having a temperature higher than that of the pure water <b>11</b> to the peripheral section and the intermediate section of the substrate W in which temperature is more likely to drop in the central section, so that the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate W can be uniformized easily. Further, if an obtained temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate W is not uniform, the substrate treating apparatus can independently control an amount of heat, which is supplied to the central section K<b>1</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W through the liquid <b>51</b>, and an amount of heat, which is supplied to the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> through the liquid <b>52</b>, thereby changing the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate W. This reduces a difference between a desired treatment amount and an actual treatment amount and variations in the treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate W through control of the amounts of heat supplied from two systems, namely, a supply system of the liquid <b>51</b> and a supply system of the liquid <b>52</b>, at low cost. The treatment amount in the central section of the substrate W can be made uniform independently of the treatment conditions. The amount of heat to be supplied to the peripheral section and the intermediate section through the liquid <b>52</b> is adjusted based on the amount of heat to be supplied to the central section of the substrate W through the liquid <b>51</b>, so that the conditions for controlling an amount of heat corresponding to a desired treatment amount can be obtained easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In the substrate treating apparatus according to the first embodiment configured as described above, the pure water <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and the pure water <b>11</b> <i>b </i>are divided from the pure water <b>11</b> at a branching point at which the pipe <b>383</b> located at some midpoint in the conduit <b>382</b> guided by the pure water supply source <b>131</b> is branched off. If a long path from the pure water supply source <b>131</b> to the branching portion increases a temperature decrease amount of the pure water <b>11</b>, a temperature difference between the pure water <b>11</b> <i>a </i>supplied to the first supply unit <b>301</b> and the pure water <b>11</b> <i>b </i>supplied to the second supply unit <b>302</b> is reduced. This further reduces a temperature difference between the treatment solution <b>53</b> and the liquid <b>51</b>, causing the central section of the substrate W to more easily approach the temperature according to a desired treatment amount in the thickness direction of the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The substrate treating apparatus according to the first embodiment configured as described above mixes the pure water <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and the liquid <b>14</b> having the same temperature as that of the chemical solution <b>13</b> such that a mixing ratio between the pure water <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and the chemical solution <b>13</b> in the treatment solution <b>53</b> is equal to a mixing ratio between the pure water <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and the liquid <b>14</b> for temperature adjustment in the liquid <b>51</b>, thereby preparing the liquid <b>51</b>. Thus, a temperature difference between the treatment solution <b>53</b> and the liquid <b>51</b> can be reduced independently of whether the mixing ratios are large or small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The substrate treating apparatus according to the first embodiment configured as described above varies a ratio between an amount of heat to be supplied to the central section K<b>1</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W and an amount of heat to be supplied to the peripheral section K<b>3</b> and the intermediate section K<b>2</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b>, in accordance with the supply position of the treatment solution <b>53</b> that is scanned on the upper surface S<b>1</b> of the substrate W. This allows the temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate W to further approach the temperature distribution required in accordance with the supply position of the treatment solution <b>53</b>. Thus, also in scanning of the supply position of the treatment solution <b>53</b>, variations in treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate W can be reduced further.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The substrate treating apparatus according to the first embodiment configured as described above varies a ratio between the flow rate of the liquid <b>51</b> and the flow rate of the liquid <b>52</b> in accordance with the scanned supply position of the treatment solution <b>53</b>. These flow rates can be changed rapidly, increasing the responsivity of fluctuations in temperature distribution in the radial direction of the substrate W with respect to the variations in the supply position of the treatment solution <b>53</b>, further reducing variations in treatment amount at the respective portions of the substrate W.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">The substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b>A treats a substrate with a treatment solution containing a chemical solution (“chemical solution treatment”). Specifically, the substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b>A etches an upper surface (also referred to as a “front surface”) S<b>1</b> of a substrate W such as a semiconductor wafer using an etching solution as a treatment solution, thereby removing a thin film (waste material) formed on the upper surface S<b>1</b>.

The control unit <b>161</b>A also controls the chuck rotating mechanism <b>156</b> to adjust a rotational speed.

In the cleaning treatment for a lower nozzle and the draining treatment, the substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b>A discharges, for example, the low-temperature liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> having the same temperature as that of the low-temperature treatment solution <b>53</b> to the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W from the lower nozzle <b>240</b> as a rinse solution.</div>

Consequently, the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> after the high-temperature chemical solution treatment becomes higher than after the immediately preceding low-temperature chemical solution treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Discussed below is a case where in the rinsing treatment after the high-temperature chemical solution treatment in which the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> has risen as described above, the lower nozzle <b>240</b> performs, out of discharging of the liquid <b>51</b> to the central section K<b>1</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> and discharging of the liquid <b>52</b> to the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b>, only the discharging of the liquid <b>51</b>. This is because a supply of a liquid for temperature adjustment to the edge is not necessary due to a relatively low demand for the temperature uniformity in a main surface of the substrate W in the rinsing treatment than in etching. In this case, the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> after the rinsing treatment normally does not drop to the temperature in the start of the immediately preceding low-temperature chemical solution treatment. The period of the cleaning treatment for the lower nozzle in Step S<b>40</b> is normally shorter than the period of the rinsing treatment, and accordingly, even after the cleaning treatment for the lower nozzle, the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> does not drop to the temperature in the start of the immediately preceding low-temperature chemical solution treatment. For this reason, when a series of substrate treatments are repeatedly performed on a plurality of substrates W, the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> rises with an increasing number of substrates W that have been treated, and the temperatures of the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, discharged from the lower nozzle <b>240</b> during the low-temperature chemical solution treatment, rise while the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> pass through the flow paths <b>246</b> and <b>247</b> inside the lower nozzle <b>240</b>. The temperature of the substrate W in the low-temperature chemical solution treatment rises with an increasing number of substrates treated, thus making it difficult to treat each portion of the substrate W with a desired treatment amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Thus, the substrate treating apparatus <b>100</b>A discharges a low-temperature liquid <b>51</b> to the central section K<b>1</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W from the discharge port <b>241</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> in the rinsing treatment after the high-temperature chemical solution treatment, and also discharges a low-temperature liquid <b>52</b> to the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b> of the lower surface S<b>2</b> from the discharge ports <b>242</b> and <b>243</b>. This rinsing treatment can decrease the temperature of the lower nozzle <b>240</b>, which has been increased in the high-temperature chemical solution treatment, more than in the case where only the liquid <b>51</b> out of the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> is discharged in the rinsing treatment after the high-temperature chemical solution treatment. Consequently, each portion of each substrate W can be more easily treated uniformly with a desired treatment amount if a series of substrate treatments including the low-temperature chemical solution treatment and the high-temperature chemical solution treatment are sequentially repeated on a plurality of substrates W.</div>

The film to be treated, which is formed on each substrate W, is a thermal oxide (Th-Oxide) having a thickness of 100 nm or less.

Thus, even if the flow rates thereof are increased sufficiently, both of the liquid <b>51</b>, which is discharged from the discharge port <b>241</b> and spreads along the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W, and the liquid <b>52</b>, which is discharged from the discharge ports <b>242</b> and <b>243</b> and spreads along the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W, collide with each other in the portion of the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W, which is above or near the one-side portion <b>271</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b>, and then fall together to the lower nozzle. This allows much of the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to be supplied to the one-side portion <b>271</b>. Therefore, the chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b> can be sufficiently replaced with the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to clean the one-side portion <b>271</b>, preventing or reducing the chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">In the method of treating a substrate by the substrate treating apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, the second flow rate is a flow rate at which the liquid <b>52</b> discharged to the edge area (the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b>) of the lower surface S<b>2</b> from the discharge ports <b>242</b> and <b>243</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> can be supplied to the one-side portion <b>271</b> through the edge area. This allows more liquid <b>52</b> to be supplied to the one-side portion <b>271</b> from the discharge ports <b>242</b> and <b>243</b>, further preventing or reducing a chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">In the method of treating a substrate by the substrate treating apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, the substrate W is rotated at a first rotational speed while being subjected to the chemical solution treatment and is also rotated at a second rotational speed lower than the first rotational speed while being subjected to the cleaning treatment for the lower nozzle <b>240</b>. This allows more liquid <b>52</b> to reach the one-side portion <b>271</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> from the discharge ports <b>242</b> and <b>243</b> through the intermediate section K<b>2</b> and the peripheral section K<b>3</b>, further reducing a chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In the method of treating a substrate by the substrate treating apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, the space V between the horizontal surface of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> and the lower surface S<b>2</b> of the substrate W is liquid-tight, that is, is filled with the liquid containing the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> discharged from the lower nozzle <b>240</b>. This reduces the portions of the horizontal surface of the lower nozzle <b>240</b>, which are not supplied with the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, can be reduced, further preventing or reducing a chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">In the method of treating a substrate by the substrate treating apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, the chemical solution adhering to the one-side portion <b>271</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> is also drained from the drain hole <b>253</b> <i>a </i>provided in the one-side portion <b>271</b> to the outside of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> together with the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> supplied to the one-side portion <b>271</b>, further preventing or reducing a chemical solution remaining in the one-side portion <b>271</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">In the method of treating a substrate by the substrate treating apparatus according to the second embodiment described above, the counterbore <b>253</b> is provided in the one-side portion <b>271</b> of the lower nozzle <b>240</b>, and the drain hole <b>253</b> <i>a </i>is provided in the bottom of the counterbore <b>253</b>. The chemical solution remaining in the counterbore <b>253</b> is drained from the drain hole <b>253</b> <i>a </i>to the outside of the lower nozzle <b>240</b> together with the liquids <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>.
