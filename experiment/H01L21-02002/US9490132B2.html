<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a substrate, a semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly to a substrate in which at least a part of a front surface is composed of silicon carbide, a semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A substrate in which at least a part of a front surface is composed of silicon carbide, such as a silicon carbide single crystal substrate, has conventionally been known. Since such silicon carbide is higher in thermal conductivity than a nitride semiconductor such as gallium nitride (GaN), a substrate composed of silicon carbide is expected as a material for a power device for controlling a high voltage and a high current. For example, United States Patent Publication No. 2006/0225645 (hereinafter referred to as PTL 1) discloses a silicon carbide substrate having a diameter of 3 inches, for which a value for warp or TTV (Total Thickness Variations) is defined in order to prevent film quality of an obtained epitaxial film from deteriorating due to non-uniform temperature distribution at the time of forming an epitaxial film on a front surface thereof. In addition, WO2010/119792 (hereinafter referred to as PTL 2) discloses definition of a characteristic specifying a shape, such as warp or bow of a substrate, and setting a value for surface roughness Ra on a front surface side of the substrate to 1 nm or smaller and setting a value for surface roughness Ra on a back surface side of the substrate to 100 nm or smaller. PTL 2 defines surface roughness as above, in order to ensure a prescribed shape of a substrate when a thin film is formed on the front surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 1 described above does not particularly mention surface roughness of a substrate. Though PTL 2 defines surface roughness of a front surface and a back surface of the substrate in order to ensure a prescribed shape of the substrate, it does not mention either relation between surface roughness of the substrate (in particular, surface roughness on the back surface side) and film quality of an epitaxial film or the like formed on the front surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result of the inventor's dedicated studies, however, the inventor has found that, when surface roughness in particular on a back surface side of a substrate is great, during heating treatment in a step of growing an epitaxial film on a front surface of the substrate, a state of contact between a susceptor on which the substrate is carried and the back surface of the substrate varies and consequently temperature distribution is produced in the substrate. Such temperature distribution may adversely affect film quality of the formed epitaxial film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, in steps of forming an epitaxial film on the front surface of the substrate and forming a semiconductor element on the epitaxial film, the back surface of the substrate may be stuck by vacuum. If surface roughness at the back surface is great during such sticking by vacuum, the substrate cannot reliably be stuck in some cases. Consequently, defects may be produced in the step of forming a semiconductor element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, when surface roughness at the back surface of the substrate is great, a crystal defect may develop from the back surface side of the substrate during heating treatment for forming an epitaxial film and the substrate may warp. Then, in the case where a substrate is increased in size, an absolute value of an amount of warp of the substrate becomes great, which may result in a factor for causing defects in a step of forming an epitaxial film or forming an element.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention was made to solve the above-described problems, and an object of this invention is to provide a substrate capable of achieving a lowered probability of defects produced in a step of forming an epitaxial film or a semiconductor element, a semiconductor device including the substrate, and a method of manufacturing the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">A substrate according to this invention is a substrate having a front surface and a back surface, in which at least a part of the front surface is composed of silicon carbide, an average value of surface roughness Ra at the front surface is not greater than 0.5 nm and a standard deviation of that surface roughness Ra is not greater than 0.2 nm, an average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and a standard deviation of that surface roughness Ra is not greater than 3 nm, and a diameter of the front surface is not smaller than 110 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">By doing so, in a step of forming an epitaxial layer on the front surface of the substrate, local change in a state of contact between a susceptor supporting the substrate and the back surface of the substrate can be suppressed. Therefore, occurrence of such a problem as uneven temperature distribution in the substrate with change in a state of contact can be suppressed and consequently an epitaxial layer excellent in film quality can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Here, depending on a material for a substrate, a surface state suitable for forming an epitaxial layer or forming a device is different and influence by surface roughness thereof is also different. Namely, surface roughness suitable for forming an epitaxial layer or the like is different between a substrate in which at least a part of the front surface is composed of silicon carbide according to the present invention and a substrate composed of other semiconductor materials. In addition, since mechanical and chemical durability is different depending on a material, a working condition (a polishing condition) for controlling a process-damaged layer or surface roughness at the front surface is different for each substrate made of a different material. Therefore, an appropriate working method is also different between the substrate composed of silicon carbide according to the present invention and a substrate made of other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Based on such findings, in the substrate according to the present invention, an average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is controlled to be not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and a standard deviation thereof is controlled to be not greater than 3 nm. Thus, in growing an epitaxial film on the front surface of the substrate, production or development of a crystal defect on the back surface side can be suppressed and consequently warp of the substrate can also be suppressed. Consequently, a probability of production of a defect attributed to warp of the substrate can be lowered in a step of forming an epitaxial film or in a subsequent step of forming an element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">It is noted that surface roughness Ra refers to arithmetic mean roughness Ra defined under JIS B 0601, and it is defined as a value calculated by extracting a reference length from a roughness curve in a direction of an average line thereof and summing and averaging distances from the average line of this extracted segment to a measurement curve (an absolute value of a deviation). An average value of surface roughness Ra at the front surface of the substrate is not greater than 0.5 nm as described above, however, it is preferably not smaller than 0.1 nm and not greater than 0.3 nm. With surface roughness Ra being not greater than 0.5 nm, a good epitaxially grown layer can be formed on the front surface of the substrate. In addition, with surface roughness Ra being not smaller than 0.1 nm, increase in the number of steps in polishing treatment such as CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polish) is suppressed and lowering in yield is suppressed. Thus, excessive increase in manufacturing cost can be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, though a standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra at the front surface of the substrate is not greater than 0.2 nm as described above, it is preferably not greater than 0.1 nm and more preferably not greater than 0.05 nm. With standard deviation σ being not greater than 0.2 nm as such, a uniform epitaxially grown layer can be formed on the front surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, though an average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm, it is preferably not smaller than 0.4 nm and not greater than 5 nm and more preferably not smaller than 0.5 nm and not greater than 2 nm. It is noted that, when the average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is not smaller than 10 nm, a state of contact between the susceptor and the back surface of the substrate locally changes (varies) in the step of forming an epitaxially grown layer. Therefore, temperature distribution in the substrate becomes non-uniform and quality of a resultant epitaxial layer may lower. Furthermore, a problem of great warp of the substrate due to extension of a crystal defect from the back surface of the substrate during heating occurs and yield in a device step may lower. In order to set the average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface to less than 0.3 nm, highly sophisticated surface treatment is required, which leads to increase in cost for manufacturing a substrate and lower productivity in a process for manufacturing a substrate. For example, in order to set the average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface of the substrate to less than 0.3 nm, CMP treatment using colloidal silica and chemical components or the like is required, because it is difficult to achieve this value with normal polishing using neutral diamond slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Though standard deviation r of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is not greater than 3 nm as described above, it is preferably not greater than 1.5 nm and more preferably not greater than 0.7 nm. By doing so, a state of contact between the back surface of the substrate and the susceptor can be substantially uniform over the entire back surface and consequently a uniform epitaxially grown layer can be formed on the front surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, a diameter of the front surface of the substrate is set to 110 mm or greater. By doing so, the number of semiconductor elements (chips) which can be formed on the substrate can be increased by using a substrate having a large area. Consequently, manufacturing cost in the step of forming a semiconductor element (a device step) can be reduced and productivity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A semiconductor device according to this invention includes the substrate above, an epitaxial layer, and an electrode. The epitaxial layer is formed on the front surface of the substrate and composed of silicon carbide. The electrode is formed on the epitaxial layer. In this case, a semiconductor device achieving a lowered probability of production of a defect and suppressed manufacturing cost can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, a method of manufacturing a substrate according to this invention includes the steps of preparing an ingot composed of silicon carbide, obtaining a substrate having a front surface and a back surface and a diameter of the front surface not smaller than 110 mm by slicing the ingot, and polishing the front surface and the back surface of the substrate. In the polishing step, by controlling a resistance coefficient in the polishing step, the front surface and the back surface are polished such that an average value of surface roughness Ra at the front surface is not greater than 0.5 nm and a standard deviation of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 0.2 nm and such that an average value of surface roughness Ra at the back surface is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and a standard deviation of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 3 nm. In this case, the substrate according to the present invention can reliably be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to this invention includes the steps of preparing the substrate above, forming an epitaxial layer composed of silicon carbide on the front surface of the substrate, and forming an electrode on the epitaxial layer. In this case, by using the substrate according to the present invention, a probability of production of a defect is lowered and cost for manufacturing a semiconductor device can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, a substrate capable of allowing formation of an epitaxially grown film having good film quality and lowering a probability of production of a defect, a semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the same can be provided.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings. It is noted that, in the drawings below, the same or corresponding elements have the same reference characters allotted and description thereof will not be repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">An embodiment of a substrate according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">A substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is substrate <b>1</b> composed of single crystal of silicon carbide, and an average value of surface roughness Ra at a front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is not greater than 0.5 nm and a standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 0.2 nm. In addition, an average value of surface roughness Ra at a back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 3 nm. Moreover, a diameter D of the front surface of substrate <b>1</b> is not smaller than 110 mm. Thus, in substrate <b>1</b> of which surface roughness is controlled also for back surface <b>12</b> in addition to front surface <b>11</b>, a state of contact between back surface <b>12</b> and a susceptor of a film formation apparatus on which substrate <b>1</b> is carried can be made uniform over the entire back surface <b>12</b> in growing an epitaxial film composed of silicon carbide on front surface <b>11</b>. Therefore, temperature distribution produced in substrate <b>1</b> attributed to occurrence of local variation in a state of contact can be suppressed. Therefore, uniformity in film quality such as crystallinity of or impurity concentration in a formed epitaxial film can be improved. Consequently, variation in characteristics of a semiconductor device formed by making use of the epitaxial film can be suppressed and yield of a resultant semiconductor device can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, substrate <b>1</b> satisfies relational expressions of 100≦D/T≦1000 and 0≦Wb/T≦0.2, where D (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) represents a diameter of front surface <b>11</b>, T (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) represents a thickness of substrate <b>1</b>, and Wb represents warp of the back surface in substrate <b>1</b> above. In this case, the present invention is applied to relatively large substrate <b>1</b> less in warp, and an effect of the present invention that a probability of a defect produced in a step of forming an epitaxial film or a process for manufacturing a semiconductor device can be lowered is more significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">A method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> composed of silicon carbide, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, will be described next with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, initially, a substrate preparation step (S<b>10</b>) is performed. Here, a substrate composed of silicon carbide, which is an object to be worked and of which surface roughness is to be adjusted, is prepared. Specifically, for example, a crystal growth step (S<b>11</b>) for epitaxially growing silicon carbide on a seed substrate is performed. Thus, an ingot composed of silicon carbide and having a size to some extent is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Then, an ingot shaping step (S<b>12</b>) is performed. Specifically, a front surface, a back surface, an outer circumference, and the like of an ingot obtained in the step (S<b>11</b>) described above are ground to obtain an ingot having prescribed shape and plane orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, a slicing step (S<b>13</b>) is performed. In this step (S<b>13</b>), the ingot obtained as described above is sliced by using a wire saw or the like. Consequently, a substrate composed of silicon carbide, which is an object to be worked and of which surface roughness is to be adjusted, is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a surface treatment step (S<b>20</b>) is performed. Specifically, a grinding step (S<b>21</b>) for grinding the front surface and the back surface of the substrate with any conventionally well-known method is performed. Through this step (S<b>21</b>), a thickness of the substrate is adjusted so that surface roughness Ra on the front surface side and the back surface side of the substrate is reduced to a certain value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Then, a polishing step (S<b>22</b>) is performed. In this step (S<b>22</b>), the front surface and the back surface of the substrate are polished by using, for example, a lapping apparatus or a CMP apparatus. Through this step (S<b>22</b>), front surface <b>11</b> and back surface <b>12</b> having surface roughness Ra as described above are obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, a cleaning step (S<b>30</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is performed. Specifically, the front surface and the back surface of the polished substrate are cleaned with any conventionally well-known method. Thus, substrate <b>1</b> composed of silicon carbide, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention is applicable not only to a substrate composed of single crystal SiC as described above but also to a bonded substrate (a combined substrate) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A variation of the embodiment of the substrate according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, substrate <b>1</b> which is a variation of the embodiment of the substrate according to the present invention is a bonded substrate obtained by joining a plurality of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> composed of single crystal silicon carbide to a front surface of a base substrate <b>20</b>. By bonding small-piece single crystal substrates of high quality to an inexpensive, large base substrate, a large-diameter substrate excellent in crystal quality of the front surface can be fabricated with low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A gap between the plurality of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> is preferably buried at a joint surface <b>31</b>. Though a material for base substrate <b>20</b> is not particularly limited, a substrate composed of silicon carbide is preferably used in terms of heat resistance and strength. Silicon carbide may be in any form of single crystal, polycrystal, and a sintered body having many dislocations or defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In this substrate <b>1</b> as well, an average value of surface roughness Ra at front surface <b>11</b>, which is a surface where single crystal silicon carbide is exposed and on which an epitaxial film or the like is to be formed, can be not greater than 0.5 nm and standard deviation σ thereof can be not greater than 0.2 nm. In addition, an average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and standard deviation σ thereof is not greater than 3 nm. Such substrate <b>1</b> can also achieve an effect the same as that obtained with the substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will briefly be described. A method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is basically the same as the method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, however, the substrate preparation step (S<b>10</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is different from that in the method of manufacturing the substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Namely, in the method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, though the same steps are performed until the crystal growth step (S<b>11</b>), the ingot shaping step (S<b>12</b>), and the slicing step (S<b>13</b>) previously described as the substrate preparation step (S<b>10</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, subsequently, a tile substrate forming step (S<b>14</b>) for forming single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is performed. In this step (S<b>14</b>), single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b> is cut, for example, by using a dicing saw, a wire saw, or the like from the substrate obtained in the slicing step (S<b>13</b>) above. A two-dimensional shape of this single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b> can be in any shape such as a polygonal shape including a triangle and a quadrangle, or a circular shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Thereafter, a bonding step (S<b>15</b>) is performed. In this step (S<b>15</b>), a plurality of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> are arranged on base substrate <b>20</b> with any method and joined to one another. As a method used in this bonding step (S<b>15</b>), for example, any method such as a method of forming silicon carbide to serve as a joining material with a sublimation method or the like and a method of joint with an adhesive can be used. Thereafter, substrate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be obtained by performing the surface treatment step (S<b>20</b>) and the cleaning step (S<b>30</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">A method of manufacturing UMOS <b>410</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be described next with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a method of manufacturing UMOS <b>410</b>, initially, a substrate preparation step (S<b>100</b>) which is a step of preparing substrate <b>1</b> is performed. In this step (S<b>100</b>), substrate <b>1</b> may be prepared by performing the step of manufacturing a substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, an epitaxial growth step (S<b>200</b>) which is a step of forming n type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b> on the front surface of substrate <b>1</b> is performed. Then, a working step (S<b>300</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is performed. Specifically, a step (S<b>310</b>) of forming p-type well region <b>117</b>, p<sup>+</sup> type well contact impurity region <b>116</b>, and n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity region <b>111</b> is performed with ion implantation or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In the step (S<b>300</b>), then, a step (S<b>320</b>) of forming a groove by partially removing p-type well region <b>117</b> and n<sup>− </sup>type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b> between the pair of n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity regions is performed. In this step (S<b>320</b>), a groove can be formed, for example, by using reactive ion etching (RIE). It is noted that, in order to ensure conduction between source electrode <b>121</b> and drain electrode <b>124</b> by forming an inversion layer in the vicinity of the side surface of the groove in p-type well region <b>117</b>, a depth in the up/down direction of the groove is preferably greater than a thickness of p-type well region <b>117</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, an electrode formation step (S<b>400</b>) corresponding to the step of forming a structure other than an epitaxial layer is performed. Specifically, an insulating film to be gate insulating film <b>107</b> is formed, for example, with thermal oxidation, on the inner surface of the groove formed with the method above and on the upper surface of p-type well region <b>117</b>. Thereafter, using a mask pattern formed in a photolithography step as a mask, the insulating film is partially etched away, to thereby form gate insulating film <b>107</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Gate electrode <b>122</b> is formed on gate insulating film <b>107</b>. In addition, after interlayer insulating film <b>106</b> is formed to cover the entirety, interlayer insulating film <b>106</b> is partially removed by etching, using a mask pattern formed on interlayer insulating film <b>106</b> as a mask. Thus, an opening is formed to expose a part of the upper surface of n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity region <b>111</b> and the p<sup>+</sup> type well contact impurity region. Then, source electrode <b>121</b> is formed to connect through the opening to n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity region <b>111</b> and the p<sup>+</sup> type well contact impurity region and to cover interlayer insulating film <b>106</b> on gate electrode <b>122</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">An operation of DMOS <b>420</b> will now be described. If a voltage is not applied to gate electrode <b>122</b>, in DMOS <b>420</b>, conduction from source electrode <b>121</b> to drain electrode <b>124</b> is prevented either between n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity region <b>111</b> and p-type well region <b>117</b> or between p-type well region <b>117</b> and n type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b>, because n<sup>+</sup> type source impurity region <b>111</b> is of the n-type, p-type well region <b>117</b> is of the p-type, and n type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b> is of the n-type. If a negative voltage is applied to gate electrode <b>122</b>, a storage layer caused by holes of majority carriers is formed in p-type well region <b>117</b> covered with gate insulating film <b>107</b> under gate electrode <b>122</b>. Therefore, flow of a current becomes further difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">If a positive voltage is applied to gate electrode <b>122</b>, however, an inversion layer due to electrons is formed in p-type well region <b>117</b> covered with gate insulating film <b>107</b> under gate electrode <b>122</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">It is noted that p<sup>+</sup> type well contact impurity region <b>116</b> has a role to fix a potential at p-type well region <b>117</b> by electrically connecting source electrode <b>121</b> and p-type well region <b>117</b> to each other.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">A method of manufacturing DMOS <b>420</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will now be described. The method of manufacturing DMOS <b>420</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is basically the same as the method of manufacturing UMOS <b>410</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the step (S<b>100</b>) to the step (S<b>300</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are performed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Characteristic features of the present invention will be listed here, although they are partially redundant with those in the embodiment described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Substrate <b>1</b> according to this invention is substrate <b>1</b> having front surface <b>11</b> and back surface <b>12</b>, in which at least a part of front surface <b>11</b> is composed of single crystal silicon carbide, an average value of surface roughness Ra at front surface <b>11</b> is not greater than 0.5 nm and standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 0.2 nm and an average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 3 nm, and diameter D of front surface <b>11</b> is not smaller than 110 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">By doing so, in the step of forming an epitaxial layer (for example, n<sup>−</sup> type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b>, local change in a state of contact between the susceptor supporting the substrate and back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> can be suppressed. Therefore, occurrence of such a problem as uneven temperature distribution in substrate <b>1</b> with change in the state of contact can be suppressed and consequently an epitaxial layer excellent in film quality can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, by controlling an average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> to be not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and a standard deviation thereof to be not greater than 3 nm, in growing an epitaxial film on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b>, production or development of a crystal defect on the back surface <b>12</b> side can be suppressed and consequently warp of substrate <b>1</b> can also be suppressed. Consequently, a probability of production of a defect attributed to warp of substrate <b>1</b> can be lowered in the step of forming an epitaxial film or in a subsequent step of forming an element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">It is noted that an average value of surface roughness Ra at front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is not greater than 0.5 nm as described above, however, it is preferably not smaller than 0.1 nm and not greater than 0.3 nm. With surface roughness Ra being not greater than 0.5 nm, a good epitaxial layer (n<sup>−</sup> type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b>) can be formed on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b>. In addition, with surface roughness Ra being not smaller than 0.1 nm, increase in the number of steps in polishing treatment such as CMP is suppressed and lowering in yield is suppressed. Thus, excessive increase in manufacturing cost can be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, though standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra at front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is not greater than 0.2 nm as described above, it is preferably not greater than 0.1 nm and more preferably not greater than 0.05 nm. With standard deviation σ being not greater than 0.2 nm as such, a uniform epitaxial layer can be formed on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, though an average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm, it is preferably not smaller than 0.4 nm and not greater than 5 nm and more preferably not smaller than 0.5 nm and not greater than 2 nm. It is noted that, when the average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not smaller than 10 nm, a state of contact between the susceptor and back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> locally changes (varies) in the step of forming an epitaxial layer. Therefore, temperature distribution in substrate <b>1</b> becomes non-uniform and quality of a resultant epitaxial layer (n<sup>−</sup> type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b>) may lower. Furthermore, a problem of great warp of substrate <b>1</b> due to extension of a crystal defect from back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> during heating occurs and yield in a device step which is a step of forming a semiconductor element on substrate <b>1</b> may lower. In order to set the average value of surface roughness Ra of back surface <b>12</b> to less than 0.3 nm, highly sophisticated surface treatment is required, which leads to increase in cost for manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> and lower productivity in a process for manufacturing substrate <b>1</b>. For example, in order to set the average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> to less than 0.3 nm, CMP treatment using colloidal silica and chemical components or the like is required, because it is difficult to achieve this value with normal polishing using neutral diamond slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Though standard deviation σ of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not greater than 3 nm as described above, it is preferably not greater than 1.5 nm and more preferably not greater than 0.7 nm. By doing so, a state of contact between back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> and the susceptor can be substantially uniform over the entire back surface and consequently a uniform epitaxial layer can be formed on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, diameter D of front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is set to 110 mm or greater. By doing so, the number of semiconductor elements (chips) which can be formed on substrate <b>1</b> can be increased by using substrate <b>1</b> having a large area. Consequently, cost for manufacturing a semiconductor element can be reduced and productivity in the step of forming a semiconductor element can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">It is noted that surface roughness Ra can be measured with AFM or an optical interferometer-type roughness tester. Positions of measurement of surface roughness Ra are set to positions at intervals of 10 mm from a central portion of substrate <b>1</b> like a lattice, and a region outside a position distant by 5 mm from an outer circumferential portion of substrate <b>1</b> is excluded from a measurement target region. In addition, in the case where a bonded substrate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (substrate <b>1</b> formed by connecting a plurality of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> to one another) is employed as substrate <b>1</b>, joint surface <b>31</b> (a joint portion) between adjacent single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> is not set as a direct measurement position but surface roughness Ra is measured at a front surface of single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b> adjacent to joint surface <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In the substrate above, nitrogen concentration in single crystal silicon carbide may be not higher than 2×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In addition, in substrate <b>1</b> above, nitrogen concentration in single crystal silicon carbide above may be not lower than 4×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and not higher than 2×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, from a point of view of suppression of occurrence of a stacking fault, nitrogen concentration in single crystal silicon carbide can preferably be not higher than 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In this case, electrical resistance of substrate <b>1</b> can be lowered to some extent and extension of a stacking fault in substrate <b>1</b> during heat treatment for forming an epitaxial layer can be suppressed, and consequently warp of substrate <b>1</b> can be suppressed. Though nitrogen concentration in an atmosphere during growth of silicon carbide should be lowered in order to lower nitrogen concentration in single crystal silicon carbide, under such an atmospheric condition, introduction of a poly type in grown silicon carbide is likely. Therefore, from a point of view of suppression of introduction of a poly type in silicon carbide in substrate <b>1</b> and suppression of extension of a stacking fault, nitrogen concentration above is preferably not lower than 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and not higher than 2×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably not lower than 4×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and not higher than 2×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and further preferably not lower than 6×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and not higher than 1.5×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In this case, lowering in electrical resistance of substrate <b>1</b> and suppression of extension of a stacking fault (that is, suppression of warp) can both more reliably be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Preferably, relational expressions of 100≦D/T≦1000 and 0≦Wb/T≦0.2 are satisfied, where D represents a diameter of front surface <b>11</b>, T represents a thickness of substrate <b>1</b>, and Wb represents warp of the back surface in substrate <b>1</b> above. In this case, the present invention is applied to relatively large substrate <b>1</b> less in warp, and an effect of the present invention that a probability of a defect produced in the step of forming an epitaxial layer or the process for manufacturing a semiconductor element can be lowered is more significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, the reason why a lower limit of D/T above is set to 100 is because handling of substrate <b>1</b> or automatic transportation of substrate <b>1</b> in a device process is facilitated. In addition, the reason why an upper limit value of D/T is set to 1000 is because reduction in warp of substrate <b>1</b> is facilitated and a probability of occurrence of fracture of substrate <b>1</b> can be lowered. Though Wb/T is preferably smaller, the reason why an upper limit value of Wb/T is set to 0.2 is because uniformalization of a substrate temperature in the step of forming an epitaxial layer is easy and correction of warp at the time of sticking by vacuum is easy and hence formation of a fine pattern through photolithography is facilitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">It is noted that diameter D of substrate <b>1</b> can be, for example, not smaller than 110 mm and not greater than 300 mm. In addition, thickness T of substrate <b>1</b> can be, for example, not smaller than 500 μm and not greater than 800 μm. Moreover, warp Wb of the back surface of substrate <b>1</b> can be, for example, not greater than 60 μm, preferably not greater than 40 μm, and more preferably not greater than 20 μm. It is noted that warp herein refers to a value obtained by calculating a least square plane from a plurality of displacement values corresponding to a plurality of measurement points represented as two-dimensional positional data and calculating the sum of a distance between a greatest displacement value toward one side with respect to the least square plane and the least square plane and a distance between a greatest displacement value toward the other side and the least square plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Though warp of substrate <b>1</b> can be suppressed with large thickness T of substrate <b>1</b>, thickness T exceeding 800 μm may cause such a problem as insufficient ability to stick substrate <b>1</b> by vacuum during handling of substrate <b>1</b>, automatic transportation of substrate <b>1</b>, or the like. In addition, cost for a material for substrate <b>1</b> increases. On the other hand, when thickness T of substrate <b>1</b> is smaller than 500 μm, it may be difficult to handle substrate <b>1</b> as free-standing substrate <b>1</b>. In addition, a probability of occurrence of fracture increases and warp is likely to be great. Furthermore, warp Wb of substrate <b>1</b> exceeding 60 μl is likely to lead to deterioration of film quality of an epitaxial layer formed on substrate <b>1</b> or lowering in yield of a semiconductor element formed on substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In substrate <b>1</b> above, diameter D of the front surface may be not smaller than 125 mm and not greater than 300 mm. From a point of view of higher productivity in a step of forming a semiconductor element on substrate <b>1</b>, diameter D of substrate <b>1</b> is desirably as great as possible (for example, not smaller than 110 mm as above and more preferably not smaller than 125 mm). On the other hand, when diameter D of substrate <b>1</b> exceeds 300 mm, highly sophisticated process control is required for suppressing warp of substrate <b>1</b>, and lowering in productivity may be caused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In substrate <b>1</b> above, crystal structure of silicon carbide in the part of front surface <b>11</b> may be a 4H type, and the part of front surface <b>11</b> may include a crystal plane having an off angle with respect to a {0001} plane not smaller than 0.1° and not greater than 10°. Alternatively, the part of front surface <b>11</b> may include a crystal plane having an off angle with respect to a {000-1} plane not smaller than 0.01° and not greater than 6°. In this case, when a semiconductor element is formed by forming an epitaxial layer on the front surface of substrate <b>1</b>, a semiconductor element (such as UMOS <b>410</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) having excellent electrical characteristics can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In substrate <b>1</b> above, crystal structure of silicon carbide in the part of front surface <b>11</b> may be a 4H type, and the part of front surface <b>11</b> may include a crystal plane having an off angle with respect to a {03-38} plane or a back surface thereof not greater than 4°. In this case, when an oxide film is formed on front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> or when an epitaxial layer is formed and thereafter an oxide film is formed on a front surface thereof, an oxide film having good film quality can be obtained.

In this case, when a semiconductor element is formed by forming an epitaxial layer on the front surface of substrate <b>1</b>, a semiconductor element (such as UMOS <b>410</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or DMOS <b>420</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) having excellent electrical characteristics can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In substrate <b>1</b>, a process-damaged layer may be formed on front surface <b>11</b>, and the process-damaged layer may have a thickness of 10 nm and more preferably a thickness not greater than 5 nm. The process-damaged layer is a layer of which crystal lattice produced in the front surface of the substrate is distorted due to such working as grinding or polishing. In silicon carbide, faults are likely to be caused in a direction of a base plane and a process-damaged layer is likely. Presence and thickness of a process-damaged layer can be evaluated through TEM observation of a cross-section formed by cleavage or the like. By thus setting a thickness of the process-damaged layer on front surface <b>11</b> to be relatively small, an epitaxial layer having good film quality can be formed on front surface <b>11</b>. In addition, a process-damaged layer may be fowled also on back surface <b>12</b>, and the process-damaged layer may have a thickness not greater than 200 nm and more preferably not greater than 100 nm. By restricting a thickness of the process-damaged layer on back surface <b>12</b> in the range as above, generation of a stacking fault at back surface <b>12</b> of substrate <b>1</b> during heat treatment can reliably be suppressed. Consequently, warp of substrate <b>1</b> can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, substrate <b>1</b> may be formed of one silicon carbide (SiC) single crystal, or as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it may be a combined substrate including base substrate <b>20</b> serving as a strength retention portion and a front surface portion containing silicon carbide and formed on a front surface of base substrate <b>20</b> (a joint structure of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b>). The front surface portion may be, for example, a joint structure formed by joining a plurality of single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b> composed of silicon carbide. The strength retention portion above does not have to be composed of single crystal SiC so long as it has sufficient heat resistance and strength. In addition, at least a part of an upper surface of the front surface portion should only be composed of single crystal SiC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">From a point of view of heat resistance and strength, silicon carbide is preferably used as a material for base substrate <b>20</b> serving as the strength retention portion. Silicon carbide to be used may be any of polycrystal grown by vapor deposition, a sintered body formed by sintering an inorganic source material or an organic source material, and a single crystal. At least a part of a front surface (an upper surface) of the front surface portion, on which an epitaxial layer is to be formed, should be composed of single crystal SiC, because the epitaxial layer is formed on the front surface portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case where substrate <b>1</b> is formed of one piece of single crystal SiC, a process for manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> (single crystal SiC substrate) may include such steps as crystal growth (SiC single crystal ingot formation) (S<b>11</b>), ingot shaping and working (S<b>12</b>), ingot slicing (S<b>13</b>), and grinding (S<b>21</b>), polishing (S<b>22</b>), and cleaning (S<b>30</b>) of a substrate obtained by slicing. Meanwhile, the process for manufacturing a combined substrate described above is constituted of crystal growth (formation of an SiC single crystal ingot) (S<b>11</b>), ingot shaping and working (S<b>12</b>), ingot slicing (S<b>13</b>), tile forming and working (S<b>14</b>) by cutting a single crystal tile substrate from the substrate obtained by slicing, bonding (S<b>15</b>) of the single crystal tile substrate to the front surface of the base substrate, and grinding (S<b>21</b>), polishing (S<b>22</b>), and cleaning (S<b>30</b>) of the combined substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">From a different point of view, the method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> according to this invention includes the steps of preparing an ingot composed of silicon carbide (the crystal growth step (S<b>11</b>) and the ingot shaping step (S<b>12</b>)), obtaining a substrate having a front surface and a back surface as well as a diameter of the front surface not smaller than 110 mm by slicing the ingot (the slicing step (S<b>13</b>)), and polishing the front surface and the back surface of the substrate (the surface treatment step (S<b>20</b>)). In the polishing step (the surface treatment step (S<b>20</b>)), by controlling a resistance coefficient R in the polishing step (the surface treatment step (S<b>20</b>)), front surface <b>11</b> and back surface <b>12</b> are polished such that an average value of surface roughness Ra at front surface <b>11</b> is not greater than 0.5 nm and a standard deviation of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 0.2 nm and such that an average value of surface roughness Ra at back surface <b>12</b> is not smaller than 0.3 nm and not greater than 10 nm and a standard deviation of surface roughness Ra is not greater than 3 nm. Thus, substrate <b>1</b> according to the present invention can reliably be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">A close-spaced sublimation method or a joint method using an adhesive can be used for bonding between the strength retention portion (base substrate <b>20</b>) and single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b> forming the front surface portion and bonding between single crystal tile substrates <b>30</b>. Any of an organic adhesive and an inorganic adhesive may be employed so long as strength of substrate <b>1</b> can be retained. In addition, a polymer such as polycarbosilane, which contains silicon (Si) and carbon (C) and forms SiC bond as a result of heating, may also be used as an adhesive. Since a combined substrate is not restricted in terms of an orientation of crystal growth or a size, a substrate having a front surface having a desired plane orientation and a desired size can be obtained. In addition, since an inexpensive polycrystalline or sintered body or a single crystal having many dislocations or defects can be employed as the strength retention portion (base substrate <b>20</b>) and single crystal SiC (single crystal tile substrate <b>30</b>) forming the front surface portion can be small in thickness, cost for a material for substrate <b>1</b> can be reduced and inexpensive substrate <b>1</b> can be realized. On the other hand, since substrate <b>1</b> composed of one piece of single crystal SiC does not require tile forming or bonding as in a combined substrate, a process for manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> can be simplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">A semiconductor device (UMOS <b>410</b> or DMOS <b>420</b>) according to this invention includes substrate <b>1</b> above, an epitaxial layer (n<sup>− </sup>type SiC epitaxial layer <b>102</b>), and an electrode (gate electrode <b>122</b>, source electrode <b>121</b>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In the method of manufacturing substrate <b>1</b> or the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device described above, lapping, polishing, or the like can be employed as a polishing method for controlling surface roughness Ra of substrate <b>1</b>. In particular, front surface <b>11</b> of substrate <b>1</b> is preferably polished in CMP treatment in finishing polishing, in order to lower surface roughness and to reduce a process-damaged layer. Abrasive grains used in CMP treatment are preferably composed of a material softer than silicon carbide in order to lower surface roughness and to reduce a process-damaged layer. Specifically, colloidal silica or fumed silica is preferably employed as a material for abrasive grains. Regarding a condition of a solution used in CMP treatment, in order to enhance chemical action, pH is preferably not higher than 4 or not lower than 9.5, and pH is more preferably not higher than 2 or not lower than 10.5. In addition, an oxidizer is preferably added to the solution.

By thus controlling a resistance coefficient between a polisher and substrate <b>1</b> in the polishing step, surface roughness Ra can be controlled in an appropriate range while an appropriate polishing speed is maintained, and variation in in-plane distribution can be reduced. A polisher is desirably a resin surface plate or an abrasive cloth such as polyurethane foam, nonwoven fabric, or suede, and in particular, a suede type is preferred.</div>

The diamond abrasive grains above each have a grain size preferably not smaller than 0.1 μm and not greater than 3 μm. A metal surface plate made of tin, a tin alloy, or the like, a resin surface plate, or an abrasive cloth can be employed as a polisher to be used for polishing. By using a metal surface plate, a polishing rate can be improved. Alternatively, by using an abrasive cloth as a polisher, surface roughness at a polished surface can be lowered. In order to lower surface roughness Ra at the back surface of the substrate and to reduce in-plane distribution of surface roughness Ra, resistance coefficient R in finishing polishing can be not smaller than 3.0×E-18 and not greater than 1.0×E-17.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">A combined substrate by way of example of a substrate according to the present invention and a semiconductor element including the combined substrate were fabricated as below and yield of the fabricated semiconductor element was examined.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Single crystal of SiC was grown with a sublimation method to thereby form an ingot. A seed substrate composed of single crystal silicon carbide and source material powders composed of silicon carbide were introduced in a vessel composed of graphite. An SiC single crystal substrate having a (0001) plane as a main surface and a diameter of 50 mm was employed as the seed substrate. Then, as the source material powders were heated, silicon carbide sublimated and recrystallized on the seed substrate. Here, recrystallization proceeded while nitrogen was introduced as an impurity. Then, heating was stopped at the time point when crystal having a desired size was grown on the seed substrate, and the crystal of single crystal silicon carbide was taken out of the vessel. Nitrogen concentration in the ingot was 1×E19/cm<sup>3</sup>. Then, a crystal growth plane, an underlying substrate surface, and an outer circumference of the ingot were ground with an outer circumference grinder and an ingot composed of SiC and shaped was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Thereafter, the substrate was cut by slicing the shaped ingot. Slicing was carried out by using a multi wire saw. In order to set {03-38} as the substrate surface after slicing, the ingot was set in a wire saw apparatus and subjected to the slicing step while the (0001) plane of the ingot was inclined by 54.7° from a direction of running of the wire. A thickness of the substrate after slicing was 250 Then, by dicing an outer circumference of the substrate after slicing, a single crystal tile substrate having a quadrangular two-dimensional shape and having a size of 20 mm long×30 mm wide was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Then, in order to form a base substrate, initially, an ingot composed of polycrystalline SiC was formed with a sublimation method. By subjecting the ingot to outer circumference working, a shaped ingot having a diameter of 155 mm was obtained. By slicing the ingot with the multi wire saw, a polycrystalline substrate having a thickness of 500 μm was obtained. This polycrystalline substrate was employed as the base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Then, a plurality of single crystal tile substrates (single crystal rectangular substrates) were arranged on the base substrate (a polycrystalline underlying substrate) to be adjacent to one another, and the single crystal tile substrates were jointed to one another and the single crystal tile substrate and the base substrate were joined to each other with a closed-space sublimation method. The combined substrate thus obtained was subjected to outer circumference working to thereby obtain a substrate (a combined substrate) having a diameter of 150 mm and a thickness of 750 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Thereafter, an underlying surface of the combined substrate (a back surface side of the base substrate) and a tile surface (a side where an upper surface of the single crystal tile substrate is exposed) were successively subjected to flattening working to thereby obtain a substrate for epitaxial processes. The underlying surface was ground with a diamond grindstone and thereafter polished with diamond slurry. In mirror-polishing to achieve surface roughness Ra from 0.3 to 10 nm and standard deviation not greater than 3 nm within the range according to the present invention, a resistance coefficient was set to 1.0×E-17 m<sup>2</sup>/s to 3.0×E-18 m<sup>2</sup>/s. In Examples 1 to 6, a resistance coefficient during polishing was set to 5.0×E-17 m<sup>2</sup>/s. An infeed type grinder was employed for grinding, and a vitrified-bonded grindstone having gauge #600 and a concentration ratio of 150 was employed as a grindstone. Polishing was performed in multiple steps. A copper surface plate and a tin surface plate were employed as surface plates. Diamond slurry having a grain size of 3 μm and 1 μm was employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">For working of a tile surface, CMP was carried out after grinding and lapping. Colloidal silica having an average grain size of 50 nm was employed as abrasive grains in slurry for CMP. Slurry was set to pH 2, which was acid owing to nitric acid, and a hydrogen peroxide solution was employed as an oxidizer. A suede type was employed as an abrasive cloth. A resistance coefficient during CMP was set to 1.0×E-14 m<sup>2</sup>/s to 3.0×E-15 m<sup>2</sup>/s in the range of the present invention. In Example 3, it was set to 2.0×E15 m<sup>2</sup>/s.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Then, by changing a condition for flattening working of the underlying surface and the tile surface, 18 types of substrate samples (samples Nos. 1 to 18) different in surface roughness as shown in Table 1 which will be described later were fabricated.

<heading id="h-0008">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">A substrate composed of one piece of single crystal SiC by way of example of the substrate according to the present invention and a semiconductor element including the substrate were fabricated as below, and yield of the fabricated semiconductor element was examined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">(Manufacturing of Substrate)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Single crystal of SiC was grown with a sublimation method to thereby form an ingot. An SiC single crystal substrate having a (0001) plane as a main surface and a diameter of 100 mm was employed as a seed substrate. Nitrogen concentration was 6×E18/cm<sup>3</sup>. Then, a crystal growth plane, an underlying substrate surface, and an outer circumference of the ingot were ground with an outer circumference grinder and an ingot composed of SiC and shaped was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Thereafter, the substrate was cut by slicing the shaped ingot. Slicing was carried out by using a multi wire saw. The ingot was sliced such that a plane having an off angle of 2° from {0001} was set as the substrate surface after slicing and a substrate having a diameter of 110 mm was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Thereafter, a back surface and a front surface of the substrate after slicing were successively subjected to flattening working to thereby obtain a substrate for epitaxial processes. Flattening working was performed under the treatment conditions basically the same as those in treatment of the combined substrate in Example 1 above. A copper surface plate and a tin surface plate as well as an abrasive cloth were used for polishing the back surface of the substrate. Abrasive grains in diamond slurry having a grain size of 3 μm and 0.5 μm were employed. A resistance coefficient was not smaller than 6.0×E-18 m<sup>2</sup>/s and not greater than 1.0×E-17 m<sup>2</sup>/s. In addition, after grinding and lapping of the front surface of the substrate, CMP was carried out as in Example 1. Colloidal silica having an average grain size of 60 nm was employed as abrasive grains in slurry for CMP. An unwoven type abrasive cloth was employed. A resistance coefficient during CMP was not smaller than 3.0×E-15 m<sup>2</sup>/s and not greater than 8.0×E-15 m<sup>2</sup>/s. Then, by adjusting a working condition for flattening working, 13 types of substrate samples (samples Nos. 1 to 13) as shown in Table 2 which will be described later were fabricated. It is noted that, as can be seen in Table 2 which will be described later, samples Nos. 3, 4, and 9 to 13 were Examples according to the present invention, while samples Nos. 1, 2, and 5 to 8 were samples according to Comparative Examples.</div>
