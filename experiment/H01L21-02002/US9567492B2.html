<heading id="h-0001">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Disclosed embodiments relate to slurries and methods of chemical mechanical polishing or chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) for polishing substrates.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">CMP is a common method to planarize substrates. CMP utilizes a slurry generally including water, an oxidizer and particles for selective removal of material from substrates. In conventional CMP, a substrate carrier or polishing head is mounted on a carrier assembly and positioned in contact with a polishing pad in a CMP apparatus. The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to the substrate pressing the substrate against the polishing pad. The pad is moved relative to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Hard slurry particles such as diamond, cubic boron nitride, silicon carbide, and boron carbide, are routinely applied to polish hard substrates using a mechanical polishing process such as lapping and grinding. The size of the particles typically controls the polishing rate, where the larger the particle size the higher the polishing rate. However, larger particles also cause higher surface and sub-surface damage, so that mechanical polishing processes may employ multiple steps. For example, initially larger sized particles can be used in earlier CMP step(s) followed by smaller and smaller size particles in later CMP step(s) in an attempt to improve the removal rate and the surface finish. Typically such large hard particles are not used in CMP processes as they can induce a high degree of damage during the polishing processes.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the attached figures, wherein like reference numerals are used throughout the figures to designate similar or equivalent elements. The figures are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate certain features. Several aspects of this Disclosure are described below with reference to example applications for illustration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the subject matter in this Disclosure. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that embodiments of the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring subject matter. Embodiments of the invention are not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with this Disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of this Disclosure are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of “less than 10” can include any and all sub-ranges between (and including) the minimum value of zero and the maximum value of 10, that is, any and all sub-ranges having a minimum value of equal to or greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10, e.g., 1 to 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">One goal for a typical polishing CMP process is to have a high removal rate while minimizing both surface and sub-surface damage. As described above, to remove prior crystal damage, or to achieve planarization, the surface of hard materials are conventionally polished with a slurry including hard particles. As the particle size and hardness increases, typically the removal rate increases, however the surface and sub-surface damage increases. Thus a series of successive CMP steps are generally needed, each successive CMP step using a smaller hard particle size to achieve the necessary finish on the hard substrate. It is thus it is desirable to find a slurry for polishing hard materials that provides a high polishing rate without increasing the surface or sub-surface damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart that shows steps in an example CMP method <b>100</b> for polishing the surface of a hard substrate using a slurry including composite particles having a plurality of hard particles on a soft-core particle, according to an example embodiment. Step <b>101</b> comprises providing a slurry including composite particles including a plurality of hard particles on a soft-core particle dispersed in a liquid media, wherein the hard particles have a Mohs hardness at least 1 greater than a Mohs hardness of the soft-core particles and/or a Vickers hardness at least 500 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>greater than the soft-core particle. In a typical embodiment the hard particles have a Mohs hardness at least 2 greater than a Mohs hardness of the soft-core particles or a Vickers hardness of at least 1,000 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>greater than the soft-core particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The liquid media is generally a water-based solvent, and can include an organic solvent such as alcohol, glycol, or glycerin. Step <b>102</b> comprises placing a substrate having a substrate surface (e.g., sapphire) into a CMP apparatus having a rotating polishing pad. The substrate surface comprises a material that has a Vickers hardness greater than 1,000 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>and/or a Mohs hardness greater than 6. Step <b>103</b> comprises performing CMP with the rotating polishing pad using the slurry polishing the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Examples of such substrate materials include sapphire, diamond silicon carbide, aluminum oxynitride, diamond, (AlON), quartz, gallium nitride, zirconia and other oxides. The substrate material can be single crystal or poly-crystalline, and can have more than one phase. The substrate material can be in the form of an epitaxial layer, or comprise a bulk substrate single crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Examples of single crystal materials with Knoop hardness exceeding 2,000 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>include diamond, sapphire, silicon carbide, aluminum nitride, boron nitride, quartz, and gallium nitride and zirconia. Examples of polycrystalline materials include, diamond, silicon carbide, gallium nitride, aluminum nitride, zirconia and sapphire. Examples of amorphous hard substrate materials include, glass, alumina etc. Examples of multiphase substrate materials where at least one of the phases corresponds to a hard material include cobalt/WC, diamond/cobalt, diamond/SiC, silicon/silicon carbide. In all these cases at least one of the phases has hardness greater than 1000 Kg/mm<sup>2</sup>. The average grain size of the polycrystalline phase generally varies from 1 nm to 1 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">If the hard particle is diamond, some examples of soft-core particles include alumina, quartz, boron carbide, boron nitride, silica, silicon carbide. If the hard particle is alumina, examples of soft-core particles are quartz, silica and titania. The average size of the hard particles can generally vary from 1 nm to 200 μm, while the size of the soft-core particles can vary from 10 nm to 200 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The weight fraction of the soft-core particles to hard particles can vary from 0.01 to 100, while the size fraction of the soft-core particles to hard particles can vary from 0.01 to 100. The concentration of composite particles can vary from 0.01 weight percent to 50 percent in the slurry. In one embodiment the composite particles comprising of hard particles and soft-core particles have different iso-electric points (IEP) with an IEP difference of at least 1.0. Examples of particles with high IEP (i.e., &gt;8.0) include alumina, zinc oxide. Examples of particles with medium IEP (i.e., IEP 4.0 to 8.0) include diamond, silicon nitride, and titania. Examples of particles with low IEP include (i.e., IEP less than 3.0) include silica. For example, the diamond particles can be mixed with either silica or alumina which will result in an IEP difference of at least 1.0. Furthermore the average size of the hard particles should generally be smaller than the soft-core particles. This allows the hard particles to more easily cover the soft-core particle surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The mixture of composite particles in the slurry can be used to form composite particles with the hard particle coating on the soft-core particle, such as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which shows a plurality of composite particles <b>205</b> each including a plurality of hard particles <b>210</b> on a soft-core particle <b>215</b>, according to an example embodiment. The coating can be performed in gaseous, aqueous or in organic solvents. Example of composite particles includes diamond particles on alumina, silicon carbide or silica particles. Other examples of composite particles is boron nitride particles coated on alumina or silica. The hard particles on the soft-particle can be physically bonded together by the difference in electrostatic charge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">By coating hard particles onto soft-core particles, the “virtual size” of the hard particle can be increased. As use herein, the “average size” of a particle refers to an average value based on a volume or weight distribution of the particle size distribution. For such a formation process, the hard particle generally have a smaller size as compared to the softer core particle, such as the average size of the hard particles being &lt;1 μm, and the average size of the soft-core particles being &gt;0.05 μm. The hard particles should generally be less than 500 nm, less than 200 nm or less than 50 nm to 1 nm in average size. The average size of the soft-core particles can exceed 200 nm or exceed 1 micron or 5 micron. Slurries including disclosed composite particles have been unexpectedly found to give rise to high polishing rates for a variety of hard substrate materials as compared to a slurry having the same hard particles as the only slurry particles. Furthermore, slurries including disclosed composite particles have been found to give rise to lower surface and sub-surface damage to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Another disclosed aspect is the use of coatings on the soft-core particles and/or hard particles. For example, a transition metal oxide/nitride/carbide coatings can be applied onto the hard particles and/or soft-core particles. Examples of transitions metals include, but are not limited to, Fe, Ti, Mn, and Cu. The thickness of the coatings can vary from 0.1 nm to 5000 nm. The use of such coatings has been found to help in increasing the chemical action of the slurry and the dispersability and the stability of the slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Coatings include oxides of manganese and copper on diamond, silicon carbide, boron carbide, boron nitride, alumina, and silica particles. Another aspect is the addition to metallic oxide particles to the disclosed composite particles. Examples of metallic oxide particles include Ti, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Mn. The ratio of metallic oxide particles to disclosed composite particles vary from 1:100 to 1:1 by weight. This means if there is 10 gm/liter of composite particles in the slurry, the metallic oxide particle concentration can vary from 0.1 gm/liter to 10 gm/liter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment the hard particle material is diamond. The hard diamond particles can either be mono crystalline diamond, polycrystalline diamond or nano diamond with average crystallite grain size less than 100 nm. The average crystallite grain size can be less than 50 nm or less than 5 nm. The average diamond particle size can vary from 1 nm to 500 microns. The average size of diamond particles can be less than 5 microns, less than 1 micron, less than 500 nm, less than 200 nm, less than 50 nm, or less than 10 nm. In one particular embodiment the slurry includes an oxidizer that comprises a per-based compound, the plurality of hard particles comprise diamond particles with having an average size &lt;1 μm, and a pH of the slurry is &lt;7.0. In another embodiment, the slurry includes a plurality of hard particles comprising diamond with an average size between 1 nm to 1 micron with a pH&gt;9.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The particle size distribution (PSD) for the hard particles can be either narrow or broad. The PSD can be defined by its polydispersity index (PI) given by (d90−d10)/d50×100, where d10 represents size at 10 percentile (by volume) while d50 and d90 represent size at the 50 percentile and 90 percentile, respectively. The smaller the value of PI the narrower is the PSD. The PI index of the hard particle can vary between 5% and 350%, such as a PI index between 20% and 180%. A significant advantage of using composite particles for polishing of hard materials is that broad distribution of hard particles (PI&gt;30%) can be used without a significant decrease in performance (i.e., removal rate surface finish and sub-surface damage), particularly when the hard particles have an average size less than 1 micron.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The polishing pad for the process can comprise of a soft pad material defined herein as a Mohs hardness less than 6 or Vickers Hardness less than 900 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>or a pad embedded with hard particles such as diamond. Examples of soft pads materials include polymeric pads, metallic pads such as copper, tin or iron-like materials. Examples of soft pad materials include polymeric-like pads such as the IC series and Suba Series manufactured by Dow Chemical Company. Regarding the polishing pad material, any type of polymer-based polishing pad can generally be used. Examples of polishing pads are based on polyurethane pads, and suede pads. The pad thickness can vary from 0.1 mm to 25 mm. The hardness of the suede pads can vary from Asker C hardness of 5 to Asker Hardness of 100. The compressibility of the suede pad can from 0.1% to 40 percent. The pore size of the suede poromeric pads can vary from 2 microns to 200 microns with the size in the range of 20 to 60 microns in one embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Besides the use of poromeric suede pads, polyurethane based pads can also be used. Examples of polyurethane-based pads include D-100 pads from Cabot Microelectronics, IC and Suba Series from Dow Electronics Materials and DC-100 pads from Fujibo Corporation. The hardness of these pads range from Shore D value of 5 to 99. The porosity of such pads can vary from 0.1 percent to 40 percent. Generally any other type of polymeric material can be used with disclosed slurries. Besides the use of polymeric pads, metal pads (such as cast iron, copper, and tin), granite or resin surfaces can be also used as pads. Pads can also comprise a composite of polymer and diamond powder impregnated resin. In addition pads can comprise of hard particles such as diamond, cubic boron nitride impregnated in a metal or resin or polyurethane. The size of the hard particles in the pad can generally vary from 10 nm to 100 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally the slurry can include additives such as ions, alkali metals, pH modifiers, oxidizers, corrosion inhibitors, pH buffering agents, or other additives. The pH of the slurry can generally vary from 0 to 14.0, such as a pH of 9 or greater (e.g., 9 to 14) or a pH lower than 4 (e.g., 0.01-4). Disclosed composite particles mixed with oxidizers increase the removal rates by tribochemical action which results in enhanced removal rates. The tribochemical action can be enhanced by the use of oxidizers and pH. The alkaline pH can be modified by using alkali metal hydroxides such as NaOH, KOH, and ammonium hydroxide. The concentration of the pH changing agents can vary from 0.1 gm per liter to 100 grams per liter. The concentration of acidic pH modifying agents such as acids (nitric, sulfuric, hydrochloric, etc.) can vary from 0.05 gm/liter to 100 gm/liter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The oxidizing agent can comprise a per-compound, hydrogen peroxide, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, periodic acid, iodates, persulfates, chromates, permanganates, ferricyanides, bromates, perbromates, ferrates, perrhenates, and perruthenates. In one specific embodiment, the oxidizing agent comprises a water-soluble transition metal compound that provides transition metal ions, such as Mn. Examples of water soluble transition metal-based oxidizers include permanganates, such as KMnO<sub>4</sub>. As known in the chemical arts, permanganate is the general name for a chemical compound containing the manganate (VII) ion, (MnO<sub>4</sub>—). Ferricyanides are another class of water soluble transition metal compounds. As known in the chemical arts, ferricyanide is the anion [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub>—.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">One significant aspect in polishing of polycrystalline and multi-phase substrate materials that is recognized herein is anisotropy in polishing rates with respect to orientation of the crystal as the chemical reaction is different in different materials orientation, different oxidizers have a different rate of reaction with different material faces and orientations of the crystal. This will generally lead to non-planar polishing. The anisotropy of the polishing rate can be measured by comparing the ratios of polishing for two different planes (e.g., Si face and C face in SiC, GaN face and N face in GaN, c plane and A plane in sapphire, (100) and (111) face in diamond).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The isotropy ratio of these removal rates if it exceeds 20 may be considered to be highly anisotropic. A process for polishing polycrystalline substrate materials can comprise a slurry including composite particles comprising at least 1 hard phase (Vickers hardness greater than 1000 kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>and/or Mohs hardness greater than 6 where the isotropy ratio is less than 20, and such as less than 10 or less than 5, on a soft-core particle. This can be achieved by using per-based oxidizers with disclosed composite particles within a pH range from 0.01 to 14.0, such as in a pH range from 0.1 and 4 or from 9 to 13.9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">It is also generally desirable to ensure that the composite particles do not agglomerate when dispersed in the liquid media. It has been found that slurry stability can generally be improved by adding a surfactant because surfactant covered particles are recognized to repel one another and as a result tend not to agglomerate. As used herein, the “surfactant” refers to a material having both a lipophilic component and a hydrophilic component, and includes surface active polymers. As known in the art, surfactants are generally classified by the presence of formally charged groups in its head, with non-ionic, cationic, anionic, and cationic surfactants. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed zwitterionic. All surfactant types can generally be used with disclosed embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The concentration of surfactants used in disclosed slurries depends on the type of the surfactant used, the surfaces of slurry particles and the substrate material being polished. At low concentrations, the surfactant may adsorb onto the solid surfaces in a patchy manner and change the electrostatic properties and the surface energy of the surface. The adsorption of the surfactant under these conditions may reduce the polishing rate of the substrate surface. At higher concentrations of surfactant, the surfactant molecules may coalesce together to form self-assembled structures. Examples of structured surfactants can include spheres, cylindrical rods, bi-layers, disks and vesicles. Once the bulk critical micelle concentration (CMC) of surfactant is reached, the surface tension of the solution does not generally decrease any further, but is accompanied by a rapid drop in the electrical conductivity of the bulk solution. The surfactant concentration is generally at least 0.0001 of the CMC for non-ionic surfactants and at least 0.001 CMC for cationic and anionic and zwitterionic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The slurry can include salts such as alkali ions (e.g., Na, K) in a concentration 0.01 gm/liter to 200 gm/liter. For example, sodium hydroxide or a sodium salt can be added to the slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">It is noted that the composite particle slurries disclosed herein are applicable to polishing hard materials that have a Vickers hardness greater than 1,000 Kg/mm<sup>2</sup>, such a diamond, carbides, oxides, nitrides which have a Vickers hardness greater than 1,500 Kg/mm<sup>2</sup>. The increase in removal rate is generally either due to chemical effects or composite particle effects, or both, and are generally more applicable to such hard materials. The polishing of softer materials using composite particle slurries is not generally as useful as softer materials already have high relative intrinsic polishing rates.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Disclosed embodiments are further illustrated by the following specific Examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope or content of this Disclosure in any way.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0008">Sapphire Polishing with Slurries Including Composite Particles</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Polishing experiments were conducted on a Buehler Rotopol single sided or PR Hoffmann double sided polisher. The hard particles were diamond, with a particle size varying from 4 nm to 20 μms. The hard particles used also included metal oxide (copper oxide or manganese oxide) coated diamond particles with a coating thickness varying from 1 nm to 10 microns, which can be continuous or discontinuous. The soft-core particles were either alumina (alpha, beta or gamma alumina), silica, silicon carbide, nitride or metallic oxide particles. A minimum Vickers hardness difference of 500 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>was between the hard particles and the soft-core particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The soft-core particles tested included soft-core particles coated with a metallic oxide compound comprising copper oxide or manganese oxide. The size of the soft-core particles varied from 5 nm to 20 microns. The thickness of the metallic oxide coatings varied from 5 nm to 20 microns, which can be continuous or discontinuous. More than 2 types of soft-core particles can be used together in the slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The liquid carrier for the particles was water. The pH of the slurry of was varied from 1.2 to 14.0. An alkaline pH was obtained by including LiOH, NaOH, KOH or NH<sub>4</sub>OH. The alkali salt concentration (potassium persulfate used as an example) when used was varied from 0.01 weight percent to 10 weight percent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The sapphire substrates polished were either a-plane, c-plane or r-plane substrates. Sapphire substrates with a mis-cut angle up to 10 degrees were used. Other oxide substrates such as AlON and quartz can also be polished using disclosed slurries. The polishing pressure was varied from 1 psi to 20 psi. The linear velocity was varied from 0.1 m/s to 5 m/s. A polymeric or metallic pad was used for polishing. The polymeric pad can comprise polyurethane or poromeric surface with a compressibility varying from 0.1% to 10% and a Shore D hardness varying from 5 to 99. The metallic pad can comprise cast iron, copper, tin, a copper or a polymer composite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Slurries including disclosed composite particles where at least one of the hard particles and soft-core particles include coatings provides several significant advantages. From a polishing perspective it is desirable to have a high polishing rate, a low roughness surface, low sub-surface damage and high dispersion of the slurries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">To quantify the change in CMP removal rate due to use of slurries including disclosed composite particles on soft-core particles with the option of addition of additives, an enhancement ratio (ER) was computed. The term “ER” is defined herein as the ratio of removal rate for a given substrate composition using a slurry having a liquid media including disclosed composite particles compared to a slurry with the same liquid media containing the same type and concentration of hard particles only. By using diamond hard particles (both metal oxide coated and uncoated) and soft-core silica or alumina particles on the ER value has been found to be increased from 1.2 to 15 for a-plane and c-plane sapphire polishing. For example the addition of 3 micron alumina soft-core particles to 0.25 micron diamond particles has been found to lead to an increase in ER value to approximately 4.5 for polishing A-plane sapphire substrates. Furthermore there was a decrease in sub-surface damage and decrease in surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, the addition of sodium hydroxide was used to increase the pH to above 11.2 which was found to increase the ER value to approximately 7.5. The addition of additives comprising alkali bases (e.g., sodium hydroxide) or alkali salts (e.g., potassium persulfate) which provides alkali ions was also found to reduce the surface roughness and sub-surface damage. Similar improvements were obtained when hard particles (diamond) and soft-core particles (alumina and silica) were coated with metallic oxides such as manganese oxide. One aspect of using metal oxide coated soft-core and hard particles was much higher dispersability of the composite particles in the slurry with a further decrease in surface roughness being obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The ER value was also found to increase when alkali pH chemistry was added to the hard particle slurry. For example if 2% by weight sodium hydroxide was added, to 2%, 0.12 micron uncoated and metal oxide coated diamond particles, the ER value was found to increase from 1 to between 3.5 to 4.0 when polishing A-plane sapphire substrates with a decrease in roughness and sub-surface damage. Furthermore the manganese oxide coated diamond particles showed significantly better dispersability and surface scratches. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are tables which lists results from Example 1.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Example 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0010">Polishing of Single Crystal Silicon Carbide and GaN</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Single crystal SiC and GaN and diamond were polished on a single sided Buehler Rotopol polisher. The hard particles in the slurry were diamond, with an average particle size varying from 4 nm to 20 microns. The hard particles tested also included metal oxide coated diamond particles with a coating thickness varying from 1 nm to 10 microns, which can be continuous or discontinuous. The soft-core particles were either alumina (alpha, beta or gamma alumina), silica or silicon carbide, nitride or metallic oxide particles. A minimum Vickers hardness difference of 500 Kg/mm<sup>2 </sup>was between the hard particles and soft-core particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In tests performed with slurries having both hard particles and soft-core particles to provide composite particles, the soft-core particles were coated with metallic oxide compounds including copper oxide and manganese oxide. The average size of the soft-core particles can vary from 5 nm to 20 micron. The metallic oxide coatings can vary in thickness from 5 nm to 20 microns and can be continuous or discontinuous. The liquid carrier for the particles was water. The pH of the slurry of varied from 1.0 to 12.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">To increase the chemical effect of the slurry oxidizers were used. The oxidizers used were compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, periodic acid, iodates, persulfates, chromates, permanganates, ferricyanides, bromates, perbromates, ferrates, perrhenates, perruthenates. In one specific embodiment, the oxidizing agent comprises a water-soluble transition metal compound that provides transition metal ions, such as Mn (e.g., KMnO<sub>4</sub>). The concentrations of the oxidizers were varied from 0.001 moles/liter to 3 moles/liter in a water-based solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The polishing pressure was varied from 1 psi to 20 psi. The linear velocity was varied from 0.1 m/s to 5 m/s. A polymeric or metallic pad was used for polishing. The polymeric pad comprised a polyurethane or poromeric surface with compressibility varying from 0.1% to 10 percent and Shore D hardness varying from 5 to 99.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The use of disclosed composite particles both with and without individual coatings for the hard and soft-core particles in a slurry has been found to provide several significant advantages. By using diamond hard particles (both uncoated and coated) the ER value was found to be increased from 1.0 to 6 for polishing single crystal silicon carbide and GaN substrate, as well as diamond substrates. Such effect was also observed in other carbides and nitride such as AlN, boron carbide, and WC. Another significant aspect observed was an anisotropic polishing effect in multi-elemental compounds (such as carbides and nitrides). The anisotropic polishing ratio (APR) is defined herein as the ratio of the polishing rates between carbon and non-carbon face (e.g Si and C faces in SiC) in carbide-based compounds and nitrogen and non-nitrogen (e.g., Ga and N faces in GaN) faces in nitride-based compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">By using diamond hard particles (both uncoated and coated) in a slurry the ER value can be increased from 1.0 to 10 for single crystal nitride, carbide and diamond polishing. For example the addition of 3 micron alumina soft-core particle to 0.25 micron diamond particle led to increase in ER value to approximately 2.0 for polishing if single crystal SiC substrates. Furthermore, there was a decrease in sub-surface damage and decrease in surface roughness. Moreover, the addition of oxidizers in the pH range increased the ER value to approximately 5.0 to 8.0 with a decrease in roughness and sub-surface damage. Similar improvements were found to be obtained when hard particles (diamond) and soft-core particles (alumina and silica) were coated with metallic oxides such as manganese oxide. As noted above, a significant aspect of disclosed metallic coated particles (hard and/or soft-core particles) was much higher dispersability of the composite particles in the slurry with a further decrease in surface roughness. The APR value was found to increase up to 20 depending on the type of oxidizer used in the polishing process. The use of per-based oxidizers was found to lead to higher APR values, where a per-compound is a compound that includes an element in its highest oxidation state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The ER value was also found to increase if oxidizers were added to the slurry containing hard particles only. For example if 2% permanganate (an oxidizer) was added to 2% 0.12 micron uncoated and metal oxide coated diamond the ER value was found to increase from 1 to between 3.5 to 4.0 for polishing Si face SiC substrates along with a decrease in roughness and sub-surface damage. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C</figref> are tables which lists results from Example 2. Furthermore the manganese oxide coated diamond particles showed significantly better dispersability (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C</figref>), which was measured by redispersing the slurry with slight agitation.</div>
