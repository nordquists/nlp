<heading id="h-0001">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-262549, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a polishing composition for polishing a product to be polished such as a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">In the production process of a semiconductor device, a product to be polished such as a wafer is polished using a polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">For example, a wafer is produced by polishing (which hereinafter may be referred to as polishing) a thin circular plate-shaped silicon or the like as a product to be polished that is obtained by slicing a single crystal ingot of silicon or another compound semiconductor, lapping it, and etching it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">Further, also when a fine electrical circuit is formed on a surface of the wafer, the surface of the wafer on which the circuit is formed is polished. In such a polishing step, polishing is performed generally using a polishing composition containing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">The surface of the product to be polished after polishing has to be clean, particularly in a step of finally polishing the silicon, even a slight amount of contamination on the surface of the wafer after the polishing is required to be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">In order to facilitate the removal of foreign matter that is one of the causes of such a contamination after the polishing such as residual abrasive grains and polishing waste on the surface of the wafer, a hydrophilic water soluble polymer that is hydrophilic with respect to the surface of the wafer is mixed in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a polishing composition using hydroxyethyl cellulose as the hydrophilic water soluble polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">However, hydroxyethyl cellulose has a large molecular weight, and tends to cause aggregation of abrasive grains due to its molecular structure when it is mixed in the polishing composition, which is a problem. Generally, the polishing composition is filtered before use. Since the polishing composition in which hydroxyethyl cellulose is mixed is easily clogged, a coarse filter needs to be used for its filtering. Thus; it is difficult to remove fine aggregate particles. When polishing is performed while such aggregate particles are present, the surface of the wafer is damaged, thereby causing surface defects (LPD: Light point defects). Further, since hydroxyethyl cellulose is a polymer derived from natural products, it is difficult to obtain a stable quality, which is another problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010">In order to suppress the aggregation of abrasive grains, it has been conceived that the surfaces of abrasive grains are subjected to a chemical surface treatment, thereby making it difficult for the abrasive grains to aggregate with each other in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0011">For example, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 disclose that the dispersibility of the abrasive grains in the polishing composition is enhanced by performing a surface treatment using silane or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Patent Literature 4 discloses colloidal silica subjected to a surface treatment with aluminate ions, boric acid, or the like, or colloidal silica in which the surface potential is controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">However, even in the case of using the abrasive grains subjected to such a surface treatment, it is difficult to suppress their aggregation when they are present in the polishing composition together with hydroxyethyl cellulose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0014">Further, as a cause of the contamination of the wafer, there is metal contamination in which a slight amount of metal components derived from materials of the polishing composition or the wafer adheres onto the wafer, other than the residual abrasive grains and polishing waste. Such metal contamination after the polishing causes defects called pits on the surface of the wafer. However, it is difficult to reduce the metal contamination in conventional polishing compositions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">(A) Polyvinyl Alcohol Resin</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0029">The polishing composition of this embodiment contains a polyvinyl alcohol resin that has a 1,2-diol structure in its side chain and that is a copolymer of a monomer represented by Formula (1) above and a vinyl ester monomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0030">The polyvinyl alcohol resin having a 1,2-diol structure in its side chain is hydrophilic with respect to the product to be polished, and therefore adhesion of residual abrasive grains, polishing waste, or the like onto the surface of the product to be polished is less likely to occur. At the same time, also in the case of existing together with abrasive grains of the component C, aggregation of the abrasive grains is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0031">Examples of vinyl ester monomer that is a raw material of the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment include vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl valerate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl caprate, vinyl laurate, vinyl stearate, vinyl benzoate, and vinyl versatate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0032">In particular, vinyl acetate is preferable because of its low cost and good availability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0033">R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>6 </sup>in the monomer that is a raw material of the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment and is represented by Formula (1) mentioned above each independently denote a hydrogen atom or an organic group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0034">R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>6 </sup>are all preferably hydrogen atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0035">In the case where R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>6 </sup>are organic groups, examples thereof include alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, and a tert-butyl group. Further, the organic groups may have substituents such as a halogen group, a hydroxyl group, an ester group, a carboxylic acid group, and a sulfonic acid group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0036">X in the monomer represented by Formula (1) above denotes a single bond or a linking group. The linking group X is preferably a single bond for good thermostability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0037">In the case where the X is a linking group, examples thereof include hydrocarbons such as alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, phenylene, and naphthylene (where these hydrocarbons may be substituted, for example, by halogens such as fluorine, chlorine, and bromine), —O—, —(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>m</sub>—, —(OCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>—, —(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>m</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>—, —CO—, —COCO—, —CO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>CO—, —CO(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)CO—, —S—, —CS—, —SO—, —SO<sub>2</sub>—, —NR—, —CONR—, —NRCO—, —CSNR—, —NRCS—, —NRNR—, —HPO<sub>4</sub>—, —Si(OR)<sub>2</sub>—, —OSi(OR)<sub>2</sub>—, —OSi(OR)<sub>2</sub>O—, —Ti(OR)<sub>2</sub>—, —OTi(OR)<sub>2</sub>—, —OTi(OR)<sub>2</sub>O—, —Al(OR)—, —OAl(OR)—, and —OAl(OR)O— (where each R independently denotes an arbitrary substituent and is preferably a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, and m is a natural number).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0038">In particular, the X is preferably an alkylene group having 6 or less carbon atoms, particularly preferably a methylene group, in view of the stability in production or use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0039">As the monomer to be, used in this embodiment, 3,4-diacetoxy-1-butene in which R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>6 </sup>are each a hydrogen atom, X is a single bond, R<sup>7 </sup>to R<sup>8 </sup>are each R<sup>9</sup>—CO—, and R<sup>9 </sup>is an alkyl group is preferably used. In particular, 3,4-diacyloxy-1-butene in which R<sup>9 </sup>is a methyl group is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0040">As the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment, a product obtained by copolymerization of vinyl acetate as the vinyl ester monomer and 3,4-diacetoxy-1-butene as the monomer represented by Formula (1) above is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0041">It should be noted that another monomer may be copolymerized with the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment, other than the monomer represented by Formula (1) above and the vinyl ester monomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0042">Examples of the other monomer include α-olefin such as ethylene and propylene; hydroxy group-containing α-olefins such as 3-butene-1-ol and 4-pentene-1-ol, and derivatives thereof such as their acylated products; unsaturated acids such as itaconic acid, maleic acid, and acrylic acid, or salts thereof or mono or dialkyl esters thereof, nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; amides such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, and diacetoneacrylamide; olefin sulfonic acids such as ethylene sulfonic acid, allyl sulfonic acid, and methallyl sulfonic acid, or compounds such as salts thereof, vinyl compounds such as alkyl vinyl ethers, dimethylallyl vinyl ketone, N-vinylpyrrolidone, vinyl chloride, vinyl ethylene carbonate, 2,2-dialkyl-4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan, glycerin mono allyl ether, and 3,4-diacetoxy-1-butene; substituted vinyl acetates such as isopropenyl acetate and 1-methoxy vinyl acetate; vinylidene chloride; 1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene; and vinylene carbonates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0043">The vinyl ester monomer of this embodiment is copolymerized with the monomer represented by Formula (1) above or the other monomer, for example, under the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0044">A polymerization catalyst may be used for polymerization, and examples of the polymerization catalyst include known radical polymerization catalysts such as azobisisobutyronitrile, acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, and lauryl peroxide; and low-temperature active radical polymerization catalysts such as azobis dimethylvaleronitrile and azobis methoxy dimethylvaleronitrile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0045">The reaction temperature of the copolymerization reaction differs depending on the solvent or pressure used. However, the copolymerization reaction is performed, for example, at a temperature in the range of about 30° C. to the boiling point, more specifically 35 to 150° C., preferably 40 to 75° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0046">Further, the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment has a 1,2-diol structure in its side chain. In order to achieve such a structure in the side chain, the copolymer may be saponified, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0047">The saponification, for example, can be performed by dissolving the copolymer in a solvent such as alcohol and using an alkali catalyst or an acid catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0048">Examples of the solvent include methanol, ethanol, propanol, and tert-butanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0049">Further, examples of the catalyst to be used for the saponification include an alkali catalyst and an acid catalyst. Examples of the alkali catalyst include hydroxides or alcoholates of alkali metals such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, potassium methylate, and lithium methylate. Further, examples of the acid catalyst include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, methasulfonic acid, zeolite, and cation exchange resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0050">The reaction temperature of the saponification reaction is not specifically limited. However, it is preferably 10 to 60° C., more preferably 20 to 50° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0051">The content of 1,2-diol structural units in the side chain of the polyvinyl alcohol resin of this embodiment is 0.1 to 20 mol %, preferably 0.1 to 15 mol %, particularly preferably 0.1 to 10 mol %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0052">In the polishing composition of this embodiment, the content of the polyvinyl alcohol resin, for example, is 0.00001 mass % to 0.5 mass %, preferably about 0.0001 mass % to 0.3 mass %. When the content of the polyvinyl alcohol resin is in the aforementioned range, sufficient removal of a layer damaged in the preceding polishing is enabled, while a significant reduction in polishing rate is prevented without a reduction in wettability to the product to be polished. Further, the content of the polyvinyl alcohol resin in the aforementioned range is preferable, because it makes it easy to suppress the aggregation of abrasive grains and further can give good wettability to the product to be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0053">Further, the polyvinyl alcohol resin can be industrially produced, and therefore the quality is stable as compared to water soluble polymer compounds derived from natural products such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, which have been conventionally mixed in the polishing composition for enhancing the wettability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0054">As the polyvinyl alcohol resin, a commercially available product such as G polymer (product name), manufactured by the Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">(B) Organic Acid</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0055">The polishing composition of this embodiment contains an organic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0056">The organic acid mainly functions as a polishing speed adjuster and a chelating agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0057">In the case where a product to be polished such as a wafer is polished using the polishing composition, metal impurities derived from materials of the polishing composition or the product to be polished may be incorporated in the polishing composition in some cases. In the case where such metal impurities adhere to the wafer or the like, they cause microholes (pits) or the like on the surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0058">The polishing composition of this embodiment contains the organic acid, and therefore metal ions derived from metal impurities and the organic acid form a chelate complex, even in the case where the metal impurities are incorporated therein. Thus, the adhesion to the product to be polished can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0059">The organic acid, for example, is preferably capable of forming a chelate complex with each of metal ions such as Cr, Fe, Ni, and Cu. In particular, in the case where Cu ions are present in an acidic solution, they form an insoluble body in the form of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>, so as to be precipitated on the surface of the wafer or the like, thereby causing the pits at such Cu contaminated sites in many cases. Accordingly, a chelating agent that forms a chelate complex with Cu ions is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0060">The organic acid is not specifically limited. However, examples thereof include carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0061">In particular, the organic acid is preferably at least one chelating agent selected from the group consisting of an aminocarboxylic acid chelating agent and a phosphonic acid chelating agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0062">Examples of the aminocarboxylic acid chelating agent include nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), triethyleneteraaminehexaacetic acid (TTHA), hydroxyethylethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA), 1,3-propanediamine tetraacetic acid (PDTA), 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane tetraacetic acid (DPTA-OH), hydroxyethylimino diacetic acid (HIDA), dihydroxyethylglycine (DREG), glycol ether diamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (GEDTA), dicarboxymethyl glutamic acid (CMGA), (S,S)-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS), and amine salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0063">Examples of the phosphonic acid chelating agent include hydroxy ethylidene diphosphate (HEDP), nitrilotris (methylene phosphoric acid) (NTMP), phosphonobutane tricarboxylic acid (PBTC), and ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0064">In the polishing composition of this embodiment, the content of the organic acid, for example, is 0.0001 mass % to 0.2 mass %, preferably about 0.0002 mass % to 0.1 mass %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0065">When the content of the organic acid is in the aforementioned range, residual metals on the product to be polished after the polishing can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0066">The organic acid of this embodiment has the following advantage by being used in combination with a polyvinyl alcohol resin that is the component B and abrasive grains of the component C, which will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0067">That is, in the case where the organic acid is mixed in a polishing composition containing abrasive grains such as colloidal silica whose surfaces are not chemically modified or hydroxyethyl cellulose, the organic acid may fail to function as a chelating agent, resulting in a failure to sufficiently suppress the adhesion of metals, in some cases. This is presumably because the organic acid reacts with a functional group on the surfaces of colloidal silica or with HEC, thereby reducing the ratio of the organic acid that can function as a chelating agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0068">For example, Si—O— and the like are generally present on the surfaces of colloidal silica. A silanol group is generated by a reaction between the Si—O— therein and H<sup>+</sup> generated from the organic acid, and a carboxyl group and a phosphono group in the organic acid generate a coordination bond with the silanol group, thereby reducing the organic acid that can function as a chelating agent in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0069">The polishing composition of this embodiment allows the organic acid to exist together with the polyvinyl alcohol resin and the abrasive grains, thereby suppressing the reaction of the organic acid on the surfaces of the abrasive grains. Thus, a large amount of the organic acid that can function as a chelating agent can be allowed to exist in the polishing composition.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0070">The polishing composition of this embodiment contains abrasive grains whose surfaces are chemically modified so as to have a minus zeta potential on the surfaces in a solution with a pH of 2.0 or more and to have no isoelectric point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0071">Examples of the abrasive grains include known abrasive grain such as particles of silicon dioxide, alumina, ceria, and zirconia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0072">Among these, the abrasive grains composed of silicon dioxide are preferable, where colloidal silica, fumed silica, or the like is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0073">The dispersibility of the abrasive grains in a solution having a specific pH can be enhanced, for example, by giving a cationic or anionic functional group to the surfaces thereof and thereby increasing the absolute value of zeta potential in the solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0074">The polishing composition of this embodiment contains the organic acid, and therefore abrasive grains that are chemically modified by an anionic functional group having a minus zeta potential in an acidic solution are preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0075">Examples of the anionic functional group in an acidic solution include a sulfonic acid group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0076">Further, the abrasive grains of this embodiment preferably do not have a point at which the zeta potential is 0, that is, an isoelectric point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0077">Further, the zeta potential is −15 mV or less, preferably −70 mV to −20 mV, in an acidic solution with a pH of 2.0 or more and 11 or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0078">It is particularly preferable that the abrasive grains of this embodiment do not have a point at which the zeta potential is 0 in a solution with any pH and have a small variation in zeta potential due to pH, thus always having a minus zeta potential in an acidic solution with a pH of 2.0 or more and 11 or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0079">The zeta potential and isoelectric point of the abrasive grains in this embodiment, for example, are values determined by the zeta potential that is measured by electrophoresis using a device called ELS-Z2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0080">The abrasive grains used in this embodiment preferably have a primary particle size of 5 nm to 40 nm, a secondary particle size of 15 nm to 120 nm, and an association degree of 3 or less, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0081">The primary particle size is a particle size measured by the BET method, the secondary particle size is a particle size measured by the dynamic light scattering method, and the association degree is a numerical value obtained by dividing the secondary particle size by the primary particle size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0082">In the polishing composition of this embodiment, the content of the abrasive grains, for example, is 0.001 mass % to 10 mass %, preferably about 0.01 mass % to 1 mass %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0083">When the content of the abrasive grains is in the aforementioned range, aggregation of an excess amount of the abrasive grains can be suppressed, while the polishing speed is maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0084">In the polishing composition of this embodiment, another component such as an alkali component and alcohol other than the components A to C may be contained. In the case where the alkali component or alcohol is mixed therein, the solubility of the organic acid in water can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0085">In the case where the other component is contained in the polishing composition of this embodiment, the content thereof, for example, is 1 mass % or less, preferably 0.0001 mass % to 0.5 mass %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0086">When the content is in the aforementioned range, effects of the other component such as enhancing the solubility of the organic acid can be effectively exerted without impairing the effects of the polishing composition of this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0087">The polishing composition of this embodiment is a dispersion element in which the components A to C and the other component, as needed, are dispersed in a liquid such as water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0088">Water is preferable as the liquid. Water containing a minimum of impurities, such as distilled water and deionized water, is preferably used, in order to suppress the inhibition of various actions of the component A to C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0089">The polishing composition of this embodiment may be obtained by mixing the components A to C and the other component, as needed, in water at a time, or may be obtained by mixing only a part of the components in water beforehand and mixing the remaining components therein immediately before use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0090">Alternatively, the components may be mixed in water beforehand so as to be a concentrated solution in which each component is contained at a higher concentration than in use, and the concentrated solution is diluted to a predetermined concentration in use. In the case where the polishing composition is obtained as a concentrated solution, the concentrated solution is preferably adjusted so as to be diluted to about 100 times in use in accordance with the intended use, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0091">The range of the content of each component is shown as the content range in use as the polishing composition. In the case of the concentrated solution, the content of each component after the dilution is preferably adjusted so as to fall within the aforementioned range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0092">The polishing composition of this embodiment is suitable for polishing in which contamination on a surface of a wafer after the polishing is required to be exceptionally low such as polishing of a wafer, particularly, in the final step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0093">That is, owing to good wettability to the wafer, washing after the polishing is easy, and residual abrasive grains or polishing debris can be efficiently removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0094">Further, the abrasive grains are less likely to aggregate, and therefore clogging is difficult to occur in filtering. Thus, damage or contamination of the wafer due to the aggregation of abrasive grains can be suppressed in the polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0095">Moreover, even in the case where metals derived from the polishing composition, the wafer or the like are present in the polishing composition, adhesion of the metals onto the surface of the wafer is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0096">According to the present invention, a polishing composition containing: a polyvinyl alcohol resin that has a 1,2-diol structure in its side chain and that is a copolymer of a monomer represented by Formula (1) above and a vinyl ester monomer; an organic acid; and abrasive grains whose surfaces are chemically modified so as to have a minus zeta potential on the surfaces in a solution with a pH of 2.0 or more and to have no isoelectric point can suppress aggregation of the abrasive grains therein, and can suppress adhesion of a slight amount of metals derived from the polishing composition or a product to be polished onto the product to be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0097">Accordingly, damage or contamination of the product to be polished due to aggregation of the abrasive grains and metal impurities can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0098">In the case where the organic acid is at least one chelating agent selected from the group consisting of an aminocarboxylic acid chelating agent and a phosphonic acid chelating agent, the adhesion of the metals to the product to be polished can be further suppressed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0126">The following conclusions are drawn from the results shown in Table 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0127">No. 5 is an aqueous dispersion of general colloidal silica (abrasive grains <b>1</b>) whose surfaces are not modified, and No. 6 is an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica (abrasive grains <b>2</b>) whose surfaces are modified. When these two are compared, the surface-modified colloidal silica has a greater absolute value of the zeta potential as compared to the general colloidal silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0128">No. 7 and No. 8 are compositions combining the polyvinyl alcohol resin respectively with the abrasive grains <b>1</b> and the abrasive grains <b>2</b>. It can be seen that particles in the composition combining it with the abrasive grains <b>1</b> have a smaller specific surface area, that is, poorer water dispersibility than particles in the composition combining it with the abrasive grains <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the aggregation is more likely to occur therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0129">It can be seen that No. 9 and No. 10 in which HEC is mixed both have a large particle size, that is, aggregation of the abrasive grains occurs therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0130">On the other hand, it is clear that, in the composition No. 11 in which DTPA is mixed as the organic acid and the pH is adjusted to 3.7, the zeta potential is 0.3, which approximates 0, that is, the abrasive grains <b>1</b> have a zeta potential close to 0 (have an isoelectric point) in this pH range. On the other hand, in No. 12 with a pH of 3.5, the zeta potential is as low as −33, and therefore it is obvious also from this result that the isoelectric point of the abrasive grains <b>2</b> is not around pH 3.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0131">That is, it is inferred that No. 11 undergoes not much aggregation in a measurement at which not much time has elapsed after the production, but aggregation proceeds when a long time has elapsed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0132">When No. 8 and No. 13 (Example 2) are compared to each other, the particle size and the zeta potential do not significantly differ depending on the presence or absence of DTPA as the organic acid. That is, it is considered that the abrasive grains and the polyvinyl alcohol resin do not react with DTPA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0133">On the other hand, when No. 5 and No. 11 are compared to each other, the zeta potential significantly changes depending on the presence or absence of DTPA. That is, it is considered that DTPA has reacted with (has been adsorbed by) the abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0134">Further, No. 9 combining general colloidal silica (abrasive grains <b>1</b>) with HEC and No. 14 adding DTPA to No. 9 are compared to each other, it can be seen that, in No. 14 in which DTPA is mixed, the particle size of the abrasive grains is significantly large, that is, the aggregation has proceeded. On the other hand, the aggregation has proceeded due to DTPA being mixed, also in the case where the abrasive grains of No. 14 are altered by the surface-modified abrasive grains <b>2</b> (No. 15), as compared to No. 10 in which DTPA is not mixed. That is, it can be seen that, in the case where the organic acid exists together with a system in which HEC is mixed, the aggregation of abrasive grains proceeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0030" num="0000">&lt;Analysis of Abrasive Grains&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0135">Variation in zeta potential due to variation in pH of the abrasive grains <b>1</b> and the abrasive grains <b>2</b> was measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0136">The abrasive grains were subjected to pH adjustment by adding a HCl aqueous solution and a NaOH aqueous solution to 20 wt % of a silica aqueous solution having a pH of 7, and thereafter were measured using the zeta-potential analyzer (device name: ELS-Z2, manufactured by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd.) at each pH shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0137">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the abrasive grains <b>2</b> had exceptionally small variation in zeta potential due to pH variation, and showed a minus zeta potential in a pH region from 2.0 to 11. Further, no isoelectric point was observed in this range. On the other hand, the abrasive grains <b>1</b> had significant variation in zeta potential due to pH variation. Further, they had an isoelectric point around pH 4.0.</div>
