<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor light emitting devices are used either as an ultraviolet-, blue- or green light emitting diode element, or as an ultraviolet-, blue- or green laser diode element. In particular, group III-V nitride semiconductor light emitting devices having a light emitting layer composed of a group III-V nitride semiconductor that uses nitrogen as a group V element are widely used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A semiconductor light emitting device substrate for supporting this light emitting structure is formed of sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon or the like, and usually has a lower refractive index than that of a semiconductor layer or the like that constitutes the light emitting structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A group III-V nitride semiconductor light emitting device has a basic structure in which an n-type semiconductor layer, a light emitting layer and a p-type semiconductor layer are laminated sequentially on a substrate made of sapphire or the like, and an n-type electrode and a p-type electrode are formed on the n-type semiconductor layer and on the p-type semiconductor layer, respectively. Then, light emitted in the light emitting layer is extracted from the p-type electrode side and/or the substrate side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">A portion of light generated by the light emitting structure is totally reflected repeatedly between the semiconductor light emitting device substrate and the light emitting structure in accordance with the difference in the refractive indices between the semiconductor light emitting device substrate and the light emitting structure. As a result, the light generated by the light emitting structure is attenuated inside the light emitting structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve this problem, by laminating the semiconductor layer after forming an uneven structure on the substrate in advance, various methods have been proposed for changing the light angle to suppress the total reflection by using the uneven structure of the aforementioned uneven substrate, thereby improving the light extraction efficiency (see Patent Documents 1 to 3 and Non-Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, in Patent Documents 1 and 2, it has been proposed to form a mask pattern on a substrate using a photolithography method, form an uneven structure on the substrate by dry etching the aforementioned substrate using the mask pattern, and then form a semiconductor layer on the uneven structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in Patent Document 3, it has been proposed to form an uneven structure on a substrate by dry etching the aforementioned substrate using inorganic particles arranged on the substrate as an etching mask, and then form a semiconductor layer on the uneven structure. In Patent Document 3, as a preferred method of arranging inorganic particles on a substrate, a method has been proposed in which, using a slurry prepared by dispersing inorganic particles in a medium such as water, the aforementioned substrate is immersed in the aforementioned slurry, or the aforementioned slurry is applied or sprayed on the aforementioned substrate followed by drying. In addition, in order to form a favorable semiconductor layer, it has been accepted that inorganic particles should be arranged on the substrate with a coverage of 90% or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in Non-Patent Document 1, studies have been made on the relationship between the pitch of an uneven structure to be formed on a substrate and the effect of improving light extraction efficiency. In addition, it has been described that the effect of improving the light extraction efficiency was hardly achieved by an uneven structure with a pitch of 1,000 nm, whereas 170% of light extraction efficiency was achieved by an uneven structure with a pitch of 500 nm, as compared to the case of using a flat substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">It should be noted that as a method of producing a fine structure having an uneven structure with a pitch of 1 μm or less, an electron beam lithography method, an interference exposure method and the like have been known conventionally.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">However, according to the method of Patent Documents 1 and 2, there has been a problem of increase in cost due to an increase in the number of photolithography steps. In addition, the fine uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate is constituted of a number of convex portions that are arranged on a surface on which the light emitting structure is formed. The more the number of convex portions in the fine uneven structure and the smaller the intervals between the convex portions in the fine uneven structure, the higher the effect of suppressing the total reflection. The fine uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate is formed by dry etching the light emitting structure forming surface as described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example, and the mask used in the dry etching is formed by photolithography. At this time, since there is a limit in reducing the size of the mask, naturally, there is also a limit in miniaturization of the uneven structure. As shown in Non-Patent Document 1, although it has been desired to make the pitch of the uneven structure 1 μm or less, production of pitches of several micrometers is the limit by laser lithography which is a practical photolithography technique. Therefore, with the method of Patent Documents 1 and 2, it has been difficult to achieve a sufficient light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">On the other hand, for this reason, in terms of enhancing the extraction efficiency of light generated by the light emitting structure, even with the fine uneven structure described above, there is still a room for improvement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, due to the effect of diffraction light, problems in the semiconductor light emitting device, such as the color shift and the different radiation intensity (high in-plane anisotropy) depending on the viewing angle, have occurred in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, when a substrate with low flatness is used, since a resist tends to become thick at the recess portion of the substrate, variations occur in the time required until the disappearance of the mask during etching, as a result of which variations occur in the height and shape of the uneven structure and a sufficient light extraction efficiency cannot be achieved. In addition, if an etching mask prepared by nanoimprinting was applied on a substrate with low flatness, a non-patterned portion (planned) was contaminated by the residual resist film, which was also a problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">For this reason, in preparing a semiconductor light emitting device substrate by conventional photolithography, it has been necessary to use a substrate with high flatness. However, there has been a problem that a substrate with high flatness, especially a sapphire substrate with high flatness could not be obtained without a high level of polishing technique, and was thus very expensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, according to the electron beam lithography method or interference exposure, although a fine structure with a pitch of uneven patterns of 1 μm or less can be produced, it is not suited for processing substrates with a large area of about φ2 inches to φ6 inches, such as the semiconductor light emitting device substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, the electron beam lithography method has a slow drawing speed that takes about two weeks to draw 1 inch, and requires a considerable amount of cost and time for the processing of substrates with a large area. In addition, it is difficult to maintain the environment (voltage, vibration, air temperature and the like) constantly during the drawing of a large area over a long period of time, and thus production of a uniform fine structure is difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, in the interference exposure method, a Gaussian beam is used as a light source, and an appropriate exposure time would be different at the central portion and at the peripheral portion if the area of the exposure target increases. In addition, it is sensitive to vibration (vibration of ground and building, vibration of air and the like), and the image is blurred to lower the resolution if subjected to the slightest vibration during the exposure time. For this reason, production of a uniform fine structure with a large area is difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The electron beam lithography method and interference exposure method require large and expensive apparatuses, which is also a factor of preventing industrial applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, with the method of Patent Document 3 for disposing inorganic particles on a substrate using a slurry prepared by dispersing the inorganic particles in a medium such as water, the inorganic particles easily overlap in many layers, which makes it difficult to produce an etching mask with a uniform thickness. Even if the amount of inorganic particle used is reduced to an extent for covering 90% or less of the substrate, it is difficult to avoid partial overlapping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, as a result of the studies conducted by the inventors of the present invention, it has been discovered that even if the partial overlapping was avoided, inorganic particles are brought into contact with each other at numerous locations, and the substrate at those locations was etched so that the cross sections thereof were a substantially inverted triangular shape. The presence of a flat bottom surface at the recess portion is required for the epitaxial growth of the semiconductor layer on a substrate. For this reason, there was a concern of crystal defects being generated in the semiconductor layer with the method of Patent Document 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">An aspect of the present invention is made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances and has an object of providing a semiconductor light emitting device with which a sufficient light extraction efficiency can be achieved and also the problems of increases in the color shift and in-plane anisotropy are prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, another aspect of the present invention has an object of providing a semiconductor light emitting device substrate capable of forming a semiconductor layer with few crystal defects and suitable for the manufacture of a semiconductor light emitting device that solves the above problems.</div>

<heading id="h-0013">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">&lt;Semiconductor Light Emitting Ddevice Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">A semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> has an uneven structure on one surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The uneven structure of the substrate surface has a number of convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n</i>. In addition, present between the convex portions are flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">t<b>11</b> to t<b>1</b> <i>n </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are central points of the convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n</i>. Based on the measurement results of an atomic force microscope (AFM), a plurality of contour lines are drawn for every 20 nm for the convex portions in parallel to the reference plane to determine the center of gravity (the point determined by the x and y coordinates) of each contour line. The average position of each of these centers of gravity (the position point determined by the average of x coordinates and the average of y coordinates) is the central point of the convex portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">m<b>11</b> to m<b>1</b> <i>n </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are midpoints of the adjacent central point determined by AFM. In addition, the flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n </i>are regions in which the inclination of a linear line connecting the surface height at the midpoint within that region and the surface height of any point within that region, with respect to the reference plane of the AFM, is equal to or less than ±10°, based on the AFM measurements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">The periphery of the flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n </i>is preferably present within the distance of 2 nm to 300 nm, and more preferably within the distance of 5 nm to 100 nm, from the middle points m<b>1</b> to mn, when a most frequent pitch P of the uneven structure is not greater than 1 μm. When the most frequent pitch P of the uneven structure exceeds 1 μm, the periphery of the flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n </i>is preferably present within the distance of 100 nm to 3000 nm, and more preferably within the distance of 200 nm to 2,000 nm, from the middle points m<b>11</b> to m<b>1</b> <i>n. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">If the distance between the periphery of the flat surfaces and the midpoints is equal to or more than the preferred lower limit, sufficient area of the flat surface is secured, and it would be easy to epitaxially grow a semiconductor layer stably on the substrate. In addition, if the distance between the periphery of the flat surfaces and the midpoints is equal to or less than the preferred upper limit, it would be easy to form convex portions with sufficient density and to obtain an improved effect of the light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Further, convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n </i>are formed so that the flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n </i>are arranged as follows. Convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n </i>are formed so that the length of the flat surfaces f<b>11</b> to f<b>1</b> <i>n </i>when viewed in a cross section perpendicular to the substrate, that is, the cross section shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, through the apex of the convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n </i>is preferably from 5% to 40%, and more preferably from 15% to 25%, with respect to a straight line connecting the apexes of the two adjacent convex portions of the convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Examples of the shape of the convex portion include a cone, a truncated cone, a bamboo shoot-like shape in which the slope of a cone is bulging outward, a semi-spherical shape, and a shape in which the slope of a truncated cone is bulging outside (a shape prepared by cutting the top of a bamboo shoot-like or semi-spherical shape).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">The most frequent pitch P of the uneven structure is preferably from 100 nm to 5 μm, more preferably from 100 nm to 1 μm, still more preferably in the range of 200 nm to 700 nm, and particularly preferably in the range of 300 nm to 600 nm. If the most frequent pitch P is within the preferred range, it is easy to prevent the total reflection of light. In particular, if the most frequent pitch P is equal to or less than 1 μm, it is possible to increase the light extraction efficiency of the blue to violet light more effectively. Therefore, it is suitable as an uneven structure of a substrate used for a semiconductor light emitting device having an emission wavelength of blue to ultraviolet region by carrying out the deposition of GaN, InGaN or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">More specifically, the most frequent pitch P is determined in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">First, in a region that is randomly selected in an uneven surface, by defining a plane parallel to the substrate surface in a square area having one side 30 to 40 times as large as the most frequent pitch P as an AFM reference surface, an AFM image is obtained for the square area. For example, if the most frequent pitch is about 300 nm, an image of an area from 9 μm×9 μm to 12 μm×12 μm is obtained. Then, the image is separated by the waveform through Fourier transform to obtain an FFT image (Fast Fourier transform image). Next, the distance from the zero-order peak to the primary peak in the profile of the FFT image is determined. A reciprocal of the distance thus determined is the most frequent pitch P in this region. Such a process is conducted in a similar manner for regions having the same area of a total of 25 or more locations that are chosen randomly to determine the most frequent pitch in each region. The average value of the most frequent pitches P<sub>1 </sub>to P<sub>25 </sub>in the regions of 25 or more locations obtained in this manner is the most frequent pitch P. It should be noted that at this time, it is preferable that the regions that are separated by at least 1 mm from each other are selected, and it is more preferable that those that are separated by 5 mm to 1 cm are selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">A most frequent height H of the convex portion is preferably adjusted between 50 nm and 5 μm. In particular, when the most frequent pitch P is not greater than 1 μm, the most frequent height H of the convex portion is preferably equal to or more than 50 nm and equal to or less than 1 μm, and more preferably equal to or more than 100 nm and equal to or less than 700 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">If the most frequent height H is within the preferred range, deposition defects of the nitride compounds to be deposited later are reduced, and, moreover, it is possible to prevent the total reflection of light and to improve the light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">More specifically, the most frequent height H of the convex portion is determined in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">First, a cross-section that passes through the apex of the convex portions c<b>11</b> to c<b>1</b> <i>n </i>along a line having a length of 1 mm in an arbitrary direction and position and is perpendicular to the substrate, that is, the cross-section as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is obtained from the AFM image. An arbitrary portion containing at least 30 convex portions of the cross section is extracted, and for each convex portion contained therein, a difference between the height of the vertex and the height of the lowest position in a flat portion between the aforementioned convex portion and an adjacent convex portion is determined. The resulting values are rounded with a valid digit number of two digits and defined as a height for each convex portion, and the most frequent value thereof is defined as the most frequent height H.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> includes a plurality of areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">The areas C<b>11</b> to C<b>1</b> <i>n </i>are areas in which the central points of seven adjacent convex portions are aligned continuously in a positional relationship so as to become six vertices and intersection point of diagonal lines of a regular hexagon. It should be noted that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the position of the central point of each convex section is shown, for convenience, by a circle u<b>1</b> centered on the central point. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circle u<b>1</b> corresponds not only to the convex portion but also to a region including a flat surface in the periphery thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">More specifically, in the present embodiment, a positional relationship so that the central points of the seven adjacent convex portions are to become six vertices and intersection point of diagonal lines of a regular hexagon refers to a relationship that satisfies the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">First, from one central point t<b>11</b>, a line segment L<b>1</b> having an equal length as the most frequent pitch P in the direction of the adjacent central point t<b>12</b> is drawn. Then, from the central point t<b>11</b>, with respect to the line segment L<b>1</b>, line segments L<b>2</b> to L<b>6</b> having an equal length as the most frequent pitch P are drawn in each direction of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300°. If the six central points adjacent to the central point t<b>11</b> are each within the range of 15% or less of the most frequent pitch P from each of the end points of the line segments L<b>1</b> to L<b>6</b> on the opposite side of the central point t<b>11</b>, these seven central points are in a positional relationship so as to become six vertices and intersection point of diagonal lines of a regular hexagon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">A most frequent area Q of the areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n </sub>(most frequent value of the area size) is preferably within the following range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">When the most frequent pitch P is less than 500 nm, the most frequent area Q within the AFM image measuring range of 10 mm×10 mm is preferably from 0.026 μm<sup>2 </sup>to 6.5 mm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">When the most frequent pitch P is equal to or greater than 500 nm and less than 1 μm, the most frequent area Q within the AFM image measuring range of 10 mm×10 mm is preferably from 0.65 μm<sup>2 </sup>to 26 mm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">When the most frequent pitch P is equal to or greater than 1 μm, the most frequent area Q within the AFM image measuring range of 50 mm×50 mm is preferably from 2.6 μm<sup>2 </sup>to 650 mm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">If the most frequent area Q is within the preferred range, it is easy to prevent the problems of increase in the color shift and in-plane anisotropy of light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n </sub>have random areas, shapes and lattice orientations. It should be noted that the lattice orientation of areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n </sub>herein refers to the direction of a primitive translation vector (two vectors are present in the case of triangular lattice) obtained by connecting the vertices of the adjacent convex portions in the same area when viewed from the upper surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">More specifically, the degree of area randomness preferably satisfies the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">First, an ellipse having the largest area in which boundaries of one area are circumscribed is drawn and the ellipse is represented by the following formula (α).

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">When the most frequent pitch P is less than 500 nm, the standard deviation of nab in the AFM image measuring range of 10 mm×10 mm is preferably at least 0.08 μm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">When the most frequent pitch P is equal to or greater than 500 nm and less than 1 μm, the standard deviation of nab in the AFM image measuring range of 10 mm×10 mm is preferably at least 1.95 μm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">When the most frequent pitch P is equal to or greater than 1 μm, the standard deviation of nab in the AFM image measurement range of 50 mm×50 mm is preferably at least 8.58 μm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">If the standard deviation of nab is within the preferred range, the effect of averaging of the diffracted light is excellent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, more specifically, the degree of the shape randomness of the areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n </sub>is preferably such that the standard deviation of a/b (ratio of a and b) in the above formula (α) is 0.1 or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Further, more specifically, the randomness of the lattice orientation of the areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n </sub>preferably satisfies the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">First, a straight line K<b>0</b> connecting the central points of the two arbitrary adjacent convex portions in an arbitrary area (I) is drawn. Next, one area (II) adjacent to the area (I) is selected, six straight lines K<b>1</b> to K<b>6</b> connecting an arbitrary convex portion in the area (II) and the central points of the six convex portions adjacent to the arbitrary convex portion are drawn. If all of straight lines K<b>1</b> to K<b>6</b> are different by an angle of 3 degrees or more, with respect to the straight line K<b>0</b>, it is defined that the lattice orientations of the area (I) and the area (II) are different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">Among the areas adjacent to the area (I), it is preferable that two or more areas having a different lattice orientation from the lattice orientation of the area (I) be present, more preferably three or more such areas be present, and still more preferably five or more such areas be present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">The uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> has an arrangement like a polycrystalline structure in which the lattice orientation is aligned in each of the areas C<sub>11 </sub>to C<sub>1n</sub>, but is not aligned macroscopically. Macroscopic randomness of lattice orientations can be evaluated by the ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) fundamental wave. The ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT fundamental wave is determined by obtaining an AFM image and obtaining the two-dimensional Fourier transform image thereof, and then drawing a circle separated from the origin by the wave number of the fundamental wave, extracting a point where the amplitude is the greatest and a point where the amplitude is the smallest on the circumference, and deriving as the ratio of the amplitudes. A method of obtaining the AFM image in this case is the same as the method of obtaining the AFM image in determining the most frequent pitch P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">An uneven structure in which the ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT fundamental wave is large has an aligned lattice orientation and can be said to have a structural configuration with high single crystallinity when regarding the uneven structure as a two-dimensional crystal. Conversely, uneven structure in which the ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT fundamental wave is small has a non-aligned lattice orientation and can be said to have an arrangement like a polycrystalline structure when regarding the uneven structure as a two-dimensional crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">When the uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> has a ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT fundamental wave within the above preferred range, the diffracted light is not radiated in a particular in-plane direction, and the diffracted light is radiated uniformly. Therefore, there are not cases where the radiation intensity of the semiconductor light emitting device is different depending on the viewing angle. In other words, it is possible to obtain a semiconductor light emitting device with low in-plane radiation anisotropy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In addition, the occurrence of color shift in the semiconductor light emitting device can also be prevented. Color shift is a phenomenon in which color is different depending on the viewing angle. For example, in those cases where the light wavelength is converted by a phosphor and then the light is once again diffracted in the device due to the uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> (a bottom emission type white LED or the like that is provided with a reflective electrode on the upper surface and converts the ultraviolet light to white light by three primary phosphors), the diffracted light overlaps the original spectrum, which results in the intensification of a particular wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">If the uneven structure has a ratio of the maximum value and the minimum value of the FFT fundamental wave within the above preferred range, it is possible to avoid deviation in the emission angle of the diffracted light, and therefore it is possible to suppress the color shift.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">The uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate <b>11</b> has a moderate level of randomness. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the problem of an increase in the color shift and in-plane anisotropy by achieving sufficient light extraction efficiency and also by averaging the diffracted light. In addition, since the space between the convex portions is a flat surface, it is possible to grow a semiconductor layer in a stable manner.</div>

This is because it is possible to accurately form a uniform monolayer particle film mask in a monolayer even on a substrate with low flatness, since a monolayer particle film to be used in the present embodiment is formed, even if there are irregularities to some extent on the substrate, by following them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">More specifically, even when a substrate is used, in which the absolute difference (TTV) between the maximum thickness and the minimum thickness as defined in ASTM F657 is from 5 μm to 30 μm, the difference (WARP) between the maximum value and the minimum value of the deviation from the reference plane as defined in ASTM F1390 is from 10 μm to 50 μm, and the absolute value (|BOW|) of the distance from the reference plane at the center of the substrate as defined by ASTM F534.3.1.2 is from 10 μm to 50 μm, it is possible to obtain a semiconductor light emitting device substrate satisfying the following formula (3).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">The coefficient of variation H′ is generally determined in the following manner. First, the most frequent height H is determined as described above, and after determining the average value μ=ΣH/n (ΣH: total number of data, n=the number of data) and standard deviation σ=((Σ(H−μ)^2)/n)^(½), the coefficient of variation H′=σ/μ×100 is then determined. In addition, the way of determining the most frequent pitch P is as described above.

As the condition for reducing the deposition defects, the coefficient of variation H′ is preferably 10% or less, more preferably 5% or less, and still more preferably 3% or less. In the present embodiment, it has been found that the formula (3) always holds for the entire surface of the substrate, even when a substrate with low flatness within the range of TTV of 5 μm to 30 μm, WARP of 10 μm to 50 μm, and |BOW| of 10 μm to 50 μm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Since the pitch of the uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate according to the present embodiment reflects the pitch between the particles M<sub>1</sub>, the preferred most frequent pitch B between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is the same as the preferred most frequent pitch P in the uneven structure of the semiconductor light emitting device substrate according to the present embodiment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">More specifically, the most frequent pitch B between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is obtained in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">First, in a randomly selected area in a monolayer particle film, an AFM image is obtained for a square region that has one side 30 times to 40 times as large as the most frequent pitch B between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>and is in parallel to a sheet plane. For example, in the case of a monolayer particle film using a particle M<sub>1 </sub>having a particle size of 300 nm, an image of an area of 9 μm×9 μm to 12 μm×12 μm is obtained. Then, the image is separated into waveforms through Fourier transformation to obtain an FFT image (Fast Fourier transform image). Next, a distance from the zero-order peak to the primary peak in the profile of the FFT image is determined. The reciprocal of the distance thus determined is the most frequent pitch B<sub>1 </sub>in this region. Such a process is carried out for regions having the same area in a similar manner over a total of 25 regions or more selected at random to determine the most frequent pitches B<sub>1 </sub>to B<sub>25 </sub>in each region. An average value of the most frequent pitches B<sub>1 </sub>to B<sub>25 </sub>in 25 or more regions thus obtained is the most frequent pitch B in the formula (1). It should be noted that in this case, the regions are preferably selected by being separated from each other by at least 1 mm, and more preferably selected by being separated by 5 mm to 1 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In addition, at this time, from the area of the primary peak in the profile of the FFT images, for each image, it is also possible to evaluate the variation in the pitches between the particles M therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">A deviation D of this arrangement is an indicator indicating the degree of the closest packing of particles M<sub>1</sub>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Since the deviation D (%) of the arrangement is set to 15% or less, the variation coefficient (a value obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the average value) of the particle size of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is preferably 20% or less, more preferably 10% or less, and still more preferably 5% or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">As described later, the pitch having an uneven structure provided on the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>according to the present embodiment (the pitch of the central point of the convex portion) is equivalent to the most frequent pitch B between the particles M<sub>1</sub>. Since the pitch of an uneven structure becomes substantially equivalent to an average particle diameter A of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>if the deviation D (%) of the arrangement is small, by appropriately selecting the average particle diameter A of the particles M<sub>1</sub>, it is possible to form the desired uneven structure of the pitch with high accuracy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">The particle arranging step is preferably carried out by a method utilizing the concept of the so-called LB method (Langmuir-Blodgett method).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">More specifically, it is preferable to perform the particle arranging step by a method including a dropping step for dropwise adding a dispersion in which particles are dispersed in a solvent having a smaller specific gravity than water to the liquid surface of the water in a water tank, a monolayer particle film forming step for forming a monolayer particle film composed of particles by vaporizing the solvent, and a transfer step for transferring the monolayer particle film onto a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">This method combines the accuracy of conversion into a monolayer, ease of operation, handling of a larger area size, reproducibility and the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">The particle arranging step the by LB method will be described below in more detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0019" num="0000">(Dropping Step and Monolayer Particle Film Forming Step)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">First, a dispersion is prepared by adding particles M<sub>1 </sub>in a solvent having a specific gravity smaller than that of water. On the other hand, a water tank (trough) is prepared, into which water (hereinafter, also referred to as underlying water in some cases) is poured in order to expand the particles M<sub>1 </sub>on the liquid surface thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">It is preferable that the surface of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is hydrophobic. In addition, as a solvent, it is preferable to select a hydrophobic solvent. By combining the hydrophobic particles M<sub>1 </sub>and solvent and the underlying water, as described later, the self-organization of particles M<sub>1 </sub>is allowed to proceed, thereby forming a monolayer particle film which is closely packed two-dimensionally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">It is also important that the solvent be highly volatile. Examples of the solvent that is highly volatile and hydrophobic include volatile organic solvents composed of one or more of chloroform, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl ethyl ketone, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">In those cases where the particles M<sub>1 </sub>are inorganic particles, since the surface thereof is usually hydrophilic, it is preferable to make them hydrophobic with a hydrophobizing agent for use. As the hydrophobizing agent, a surface active agent, a metal alkoxysilane or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Hydrophobization of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>can be carried out using the same surface active agent, metal alkoxysilane or the like as the hydrophobizing agent described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2009-162831 and by the same method described therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">In addition, in order to further enhance the accuracy of the monolayer particle film to be formed, it is preferable to subject the dispersion liquid before adding dropwise to the liquid surface to microfiltration using a membrane filter or the like to remove the aggregated particles (secondary particles composed of multiple primary particles) present in the dispersion liquid. If the microfiltration is carried out in advance in this manner, portions where two or more layers are partially formed or defective portions where no particles are present are hardly generated, and a monolayer particle film with high accuracy can be easily obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">In the transfer step to be described later in more detail, if an LB trough device equipped with a surface pressure sensor for measuring the surface pressure of a monolayer particle film and a movable barrier for compressing the monolayer particle film in the liquid surface direction is used, it is possible to detect the defective portions of the monolayer particle film formed to some extent based on the difference in the surface pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">However, defective portions having a size of about several micrometers to several tens of micrometers are less likely to be detected as a difference in the surface pressure. If the microfiltration is carried out in advance, defects having a size of about several micrometers to about several tens of micrometers become less likely to occur, and it becomes easy to obtain a monolayer particle film with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">The dispersion liquid described above is added dropwise to the liquid surface of the underlying water (dropping step). Then, the solvent serving as a dispersion medium is volatilized, and at the same time, the particles M<sub>1 </sub>are expanded in a monolayer on the liquid surface of the underlying water, thereby making it possible to forma monolayer particle film which is closely packed two-dimensionally (monolayer particle film forming step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">It is preferable to set the particle concentration of the dispersion liquid to be added dropwise to the underlying water from 1% by mass to 10% by mass. In addition, it is preferable to set the dropping rate from 0.001 ml/sec to 0.01 ml/sec. If the concentration and addition amount of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>in the dispersion liquid are within such ranges, tendencies such as partial aggregation of the particles like a cluster to form two or more layers, generation of a defective portion where no particles are present and widening of the pitch between the particles are suppressed. For this reason, a monolayer particle film in which each particle is closely packed two-dimensionally with high accuracy can be obtained more easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">In the monolayer particle film forming step, a monolayer particle film is formed by the self-organization of particles M<sub>1</sub>. The principle is that when the particles are assembled, the surface tension caused due to the dispersion medium present between the particles acts, as a result of which the particles M<sub>1 </sub>are not present randomly from each other but automatically form a two-dimensionally close-packed structure. Such close packing by the surface tension can also be described, in another expression, as an arrangement by capillary force in a transverse direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">In particular, for example, like colloidal silica, when three particles M<sub>1 </sub>having a spherical shape with highly uniform particle size are gathered and brought into contact in a state of floating on the water surface, surface tension acts so as to minimize the total length of the waterline of the particle groups. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the three particles M<sub>1 </sub>are stabilized in an arrangement which is based on an equilateral triangle indicated as T<sub>1 </sub>in the drawing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">The monolayer particle film forming step is preferably carried out in ultrasonic irradiating conditions. When the solvent of the dispersion liquid is volatilized while applying ultrasonic waves from the underlying water toward the water surface, closest packing of particles M is promoted, and a monolayer particle film in which each particle M<sub>1 </sub>is close-packed two-dimensionally with higher accuracy is obtained. At this time, the output of the ultrasonic wave is preferably from 1 W to 1,200 W and more preferably from 50 W to 600 W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">In addition, although there is no particular limitation on the frequency of ultrasonic waves, for example, it is preferably from 28 kHz to 5 MHz and more preferably from 700 kHz to 2 MHz. If the frequency is too high, since the energy absorption of water molecules begins and a phenomenon in which water vapor or water droplets rise out of the water surface occurs, it is undesirable. On the other hand, if the frequency is too low, cavitation radius in the underlying water increases, and water bubbles are generated in the water and emerge towards the water surface. When such bubbles accumulate under a monolayer particle film, it is disadvantageous since the flatness of the water surface is lost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">A stationary wave is generated on the water surface by ultrasonic irradiation. If the output is too high at any given frequency or the wave height of the water surface is too high depending on the tuning condition of the ultrasonic vibrator and transmitter, a caution is required since a monolayer particle film is destroyed by water waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">When the frequency and the output of the ultrasonic waves are set appropriately by keeping the above in mind, it is possible to facilitate the close packing of particles effectively without destroying the monolayer particle film which is being formed. In order to perform effective ultrasonic irradiation, it is preferable to use the natural frequency calculated from the size of the particles as a rough guide. However, since the natural frequency becomes extremely high as the particles become small with a particle size of, for example, 100 nm or less, it becomes difficult to give an ultrasonic vibration as the calculation result suggests. In such a case, if a calculation is carried out based on the assumption that the natural frequency corresponding to the mass of the particle from dimers up to about 20-mers is given, it is possible to reduce the frequency required to a practical range. Even when an ultrasonic vibration corresponding to the natural frequency of the aggregates of particles is applied, the effect of improving the fill factor of the particle is expressed. Irradiation time of the ultrasonic waves may be of any length as long as it is sufficient to complete rearrangement of the particles, and the time required varies depending on the particle size, ultrasonic frequency, water temperature and the like. However, under normal preparation conditions, it is preferably carried out from 10 seconds to 60 minutes and more preferably from 3 minutes to 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">Other advantages obtained by the ultrasonic irradiation include, in addition to closest packing of the particles (hexagonal close-packing of random arrangements), the effect of destroying a soft aggregate of particles which is likely to occur during preparation of the dispersion liquid of nanoparticles, and the effect of repairing point defects, line defects, crystal transition or the like that has once occurred, to some extent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">A monolayer particle film formed on the liquid surface by the monolayer particle film forming step is then transferred onto a substrate S<sub>1 </sub>while in a monolayer state (transfer step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">There is no particular limitation on the specific method for transferring a monolayer particle film on the substrate S<sub>1</sub>, and examples include a method in which the hydrophobic substrate S<sub>1 </sub>is lowered from above and brought into contact with the monolayer particle film while keeping a state of being substantially parallel to the monolayer particle film, and the monolayer particle film is transferred onto and taken up by the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>due to the affinity between the monolayer particle film and the substrate that are both hydrophobic; and a method in which the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>is placed in advance in the underlying water in the water tank in a substantially horizontal direction prior to the formation of the monolayer particle film, and the monolayer particle film is formed on the liquid surface and then the liquid surface is gradually lowered, thereby transferring the monolayer particle film to the substrate S<sub>1</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">Although a monolayer particle film can be transferred onto the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>by the above methods without using a special device, it is preferable to adopt the so-called LB trough method (see Journal of Materials and Chemistry, Vol. 11, 3333 (2001), Journal of Materials and Chemistry, Vol. 12, 3268 (2002), and the like) in the steps thereafter, in view of easy transfer onto the substrate S<sub>1</sub>, even when the monolayer particle film has a larger surface area, while maintaining the two-dimensional closest packing state thereof</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">It should be noted that in this drawing, although a state in which the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>is transferred onto both surfaces of the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>is shown, since an uneven structure may be formed on only one surface of the substrate S<sub>1</sub>, the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>may be transferred only onto a flat surface X<sub>1 </sub>of the substrate S<sub>1</sub>. By shielding a surface (back surface) opposite to the flat surface X<sub>1 </sub>of the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>with a thick plate, if the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>is transferred only to the flat surface X<sub>1 </sub>in a state of preventing the going around of particles M<sub>1 </sub>to the back surface from the flat surface X<sub>1 </sub>side, it is preferable since the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>can be transferred more precisely.

Therefore, the transfer of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>from the liquid surface to the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>proceeds smoothly, troubles in which only the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>having a small area can be transferred to the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>or the like are less likely to occur. The diffusion pressure is preferably from 5 mNM<sup>−1 </sup>to 80 mNm<sup>−1</sup>, and more preferably from 10 mNm<sup>−1 </sup>to 40 mNm<sup>−1</sup>. If the diffusion pressure is within such a range, the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>in which each particle is close-packed two-dimensionally with higher accuracy can be easily obtained. In addition, the rate for pulling the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>upward is preferably from 0.5 mNm<sup>−1 </sup>to 20 mm/minute.

As a result, through the steps to be described later, it becomes possible to ultimately form, on the substrate S<sub>1</sub>, an uneven structure having a plurality of areas in which the central points of seven adjacent convex portions are aligned continuously in a positional relationship so as to become six vertices and intersection point of diagonal lines of a regular hexagon.</div>

If the amount is within such a range, particles can be fixed sufficiently without causing the problem of excessive amount of binder blocking between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>to adversely affect the accuracy of the monolayer particle film. In those cases where a large amount of binder solution is supplied, after the binder solution has infiltrated, the excess of the binder solution may be removed by using a spin coater or tilting the substrate S<sub>1</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">As a binder, it is possible to use the metal alkoxysilanes exemplified earlier as a hydrophobizing agent, common organic binders and inorganic binders or the like, and after the binder solution has infiltrated, a heating treatment may be performed as appropriate depending on the type of the binder.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">When employing the sintering method, it is sufficient to heat the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>on which a monolayer particle film has been formed so that each particle M<sub>1 </sub>constituting the monolayer particle film is fused to the substrate S<sub>1</sub>. Although the heating temperature may be determined in accordance with the material of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>and the material of the substrate S<sub>1</sub>, since the particles M<sub>1 </sub>having a particle size of 1 μmφ or less start the interface reaction at a lower temperature than the original melting point of the material, sintering is completed at a relatively low temperature side. When the heating temperature is too high, the fused area of the particle increases, and, as a result, the shape of the monolayer particle film changes, which may adversely affect the accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">In addition, when the heating is conducted in air, since the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>and the particles M<sub>1 </sub>may be oxidized, in the case of employing the sintering method, it is necessary to set the conditions by taking the possibility of such oxidation into consideration. For example, if a silicon substrate is used as the substrate S<sub>1 </sub>and is sintered at 1,100° C., a thermally oxidized layer having a thickness of about 200 nm is formed on the surface of the substrate S<sub>1</sub>. It is easy to avoid oxidation when heated in N<sub>2 </sub>gas or argon gas.</div>

At this time, in the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the first exposed portion S<b>21</b> is exposed to a plasma of the etching gas through a void surrounded by three particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other. In the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> is exposed to the plasma of the etching gas through a void between the two particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other. Then, the particles M<sub>1 </sub>constituting a monolayer particle film are also exposed to the plasma of the etching gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0323">Here, a first region <b>214</b> that combines the first exposed portion S<b>21</b> and the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> located in the periphery of the first exposed portion S<b>21</b> has a larger area than a second region <b>213</b> that adds together the second exposed portions S<b>22</b> that are voids between the two particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other. Therefore, the etching rate of the first region <b>214</b> is greater than the etching rate of the second region <b>213</b>. For this reason, in the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the etching of the first region <b>214</b> advances faster than the etching of the second region <b>213</b>. In addition, in the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the etching of the second region <b>213</b> advances faster than the etching of a portion covered with the particles M<sub>1</sub>. Further, among a plurality of first regions <b>214</b>, the etching rate in the first region <b>214</b> increases as the size of the first region <b>214</b> increases. In addition, among a plurality of second regions <b>213</b>, the etching rate in the second region <b>213</b> increases as the size of the second region <b>213</b> increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0324">As a result, in the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, a flat portion <b>214</b> is formed in the first region <b>214</b> as a deep recessed portion. In addition, as a recessed portion shallower than the flat portion <b>214</b>, a bridge portion <b>213</b> is formed in the second region <b>213</b>. Further, as a portion other than the flat portion <b>214</b> and the bridge portion <b>213</b>, a convex portion <b>212</b> having a hemispherical shape is formed. Among a plurality of bridge portions <b>213</b>, the larger the distance between the convex portions <b>212</b> that are connected by the bridge portion <b>213</b>, the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is lowered. When the bridge portions are actively produced, for example, in the case of a combination of the silica particle mask and the sapphire substrate, the interval between the convex portions <b>212</b> becomes 300 nm to 700 nm when the most frequent pitch is 3.0 μm, and the height of the bridge in that case is 10 to 300 nm. In addition, the interval between the convex portions <b>212</b> becomes 10 nm to 100 nm when the most frequent pitch is 400 nm, and the height of the bridge in that case is 5 nm to 100 nm. In addition, since the spacing between the convex portions <b>212</b> and the height of the bridge change by dry etching conditions including combinations of the material of the particle mask and the material of the substrate and the selection of gas, the above values vary depending on the conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0325">It should be noted that when the size of the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> is changed in the etching step of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>described above, in the subsequent etching step of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> to be finally formed changes. For the method of changing the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b>, in addition to the etching step of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1</sub>, a change in the etching gas used in etching of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S can be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">For example, a gas that increases the etching rate of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>while decreasing the etching rate of the device substrate <b>211</b>B is used for the etching step of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S. At this time, the etching rate of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is further reduced with respect to the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, and the rate of expansion of the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> is also further reduced. Eventually, a large difference occurs between the degree of progress of etching in the first exposed portion S<b>221</b> and the degree of progress of etching in the second exposed portion S<b>22</b>, and, as a result, the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">On the other hand, a gas that decreases the etching rate of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>while increasing the etching rate of the device substrate <b>211</b>B is used for an etching gas of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S. At this time, the etching rate of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>becomes close with respect to the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, and the rate of expansion of the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> is further increased. Eventually, a difference between the degree of progress of etching in the first exposed portion S<b>221</b> and the degree of progress of etching in the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> becomes small, and, as a result, the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is lowered. It should be noted that the gas used at this time may be composed of one type of gas, or may be composed of two or more types of gases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">Furthermore, in the etching step of the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>described above, a change in the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> may be combined with the change in the height of the bridge portion <b>213</b> due to the change in the etching gas as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">It should be noted that even if the bridge portions are not actively produced (even if the height of the bridge portion corresponds to virtually zero), by the effect of extending the interval between the convex portions <b>212</b> due to the reduction in the particle size of the mask as described above, it is possible to secure more area of the flat portion required in the LED deposition step, and more efficient epitaxial crystal growth with less crystal defects can be achieved. Therefore, as a result, a benefit of improving the emission efficiency of the semiconductor light emitting device fabricated by depositing a semiconductor layer on such a substrate can be attained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">The pitch of the convex portion <b>212</b> is equivalent to the spacing between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other, and the arrangement of the convex portion <b>212</b> is also similar to the arrangement of the particles M<sub>1</sub>. In addition, the arrangement of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is on a line connecting the centers of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other, and the shape of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is a linear shape connecting the centers of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other. Further, of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, a convex portion team TL<b>2</b> is formed in a portion where the film elements of the monolayer particle film are stacked, and a convex portion group TG<b>2</b> is formed in a portion where the hexagonal packing structures of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>are stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">In the etching step, the etching rate of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S is preferably higher than the etching rate of the particles M<sub>1</sub>. The ratio of the etching rate of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S with respect to the etching rate of the particles M<sub>1 </sub>is preferably at least 200%, and more preferably 300% or less. It should be noted that for such etching conditions, the etching gas used in the reactive etching may be selected appropriately. For example, when the device substrate <b>211</b>B is sapphire and the particles M<sub>1 </sub>are silica, one or more gases selected from the group consisting of Cl<sub>2</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, HBr, HI and HCl may be used as an etching gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a semiconductor light emitting device <b>200</b> includes a device substrate <b>211</b>B as a base material. The semiconductor light emitting device <b>200</b> includes, in the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S of the device substrate <b>211</b>B, a light emitting structure <b>221</b> that covers an uneven structure of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S. The light emitting structure <b>221</b> includes a laminated body constituted of a plurality of semiconductor layers and emits light by recombining carriers by the supply of electric current. Each of the plurality of semiconductor layers is laminated sequentially from the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0333">The semiconductor light emitting device <b>200</b> can employ the same configuration as that of the semiconductor light emitting device described in the first embodiment. In addition, the semiconductor light emitting device <b>200</b> can be formed by the method described in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0334">According to the present embodiment, the following effects can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0335">(1) The total reflection by the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S can be suppressed by the geometric optical effects (reflection and refraction) in the bridge portion <b>213</b>. For this reason, the efficiency of extracting light generated by the light emitting structure <b>221</b> can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0336">(2) Since a plurality of bridge portions <b>213</b> are connected to one convex portion <b>212</b>, as compared with a configuration in which one bridge portion <b>213</b> is connected to one convex portion <b>212</b>, the effect in accordance with the above effect (1) can be further enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337">(3) Since a convex portion group TG<b>2</b> has a hexagonal packing structure and the bridge portions <b>213</b> is connected to each of the convex portions <b>212</b> constituting the hexagonal packing structure, the effect in accordance with the above effect (1) can be further enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">(4) Since the arrangement of the convex portion <b>212</b> has a randomness, in the plane of the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, the uniformity of the effect in accordance with the above effect (1) can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">(5) Since the top surface <b>213</b>T of the bridge portion <b>213</b> is a crystal plane, the lack of growth of the semiconductor layer due to the formation of the convex portion <b>212</b> can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">(6) By etching for widening the void between the particles M<sub>1 </sub>that are adjacent to each other, the second exposed portion S<b>22</b> for forming the bridge portion <b>213</b> is formed. For this reason, one monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>functions as a mask for forming the convex portion <b>212</b> and the flat portion <b>214</b>, and as a mask for forming the bridge portion <b>213</b>. As a result, compared to a method that requires the mask for forming the convex portion <b>212</b> and the mask for forming the bridge portion <b>213</b> separately, the number of steps required for the manufacture of the device substrate <b>211</b>B is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0341">It should be noted that the present embodiment can also be modified and implemented as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0342">The monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>may include, in advance, before being transferred to the light emitting structure forming surface <b>211</b>S, a void for partitioning the first exposed portion S<b>221</b> and a void for forming the second exposed portion S<b>22</b>. In accordance with such a configuration, a step of selectively etching the monolayer particle film F<sub>1 </sub>will be omitted.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0398" num="0397">As shown in Table 2, in Example 3 and Example 4, in both the central portion and the outer periphery portion within the plane, since the coefficients of variation H′, the improvement rates of the light extraction efficiency and the standard deviations of the improvement rate of the light extraction exhibit substantially the same value, it was confirmed that the in-plane uniformity of the uneven structure on the sapphire substrate was high. On the other hand, in Comparative Example 3 prepared by the photolithography method and in Comparative Example 4 prepared by an interference exposure method, it was confirmed that there was a large difference in the above values in the central portion and the outer peripheral portion within the plane.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0406" num="0405">As shown in Table 3, since the bridge portion is provided in the fine structure in Example 5, the external quantum efficiency is about 10% higher as compared to Comparative Example 5 where the bridge portion is absent. It is interpreted that in Example 5, this is because the light confined inside the LED element becomes a waveguide mode and scatters due to the presence of the bridge portion to be taken out from the light extraction surface. On the other hand, in Comparative Example 5 where the bridge portion is absent, because there is no light extraction effect as described above, the external quantum efficiency is poor.</div>
