<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to advance energy-conservation in the power control of an automobile, a railway car, industrial equipment, and home electric appliances, etc., from the viewpoint of recent environmental and energy problems, higher performance is required of power-electronics equipment. For these power-electronics equipment, use has so far been made of silicon (hereinafter abbreviated as “Si”), as a power semiconductor-material, however, there has started a proposal to use a new power semiconductor-material, such as silicon carbide (hereinafter abbreviated as “SiC”), gallium nitride (hereinafter abbreviated as “GaN”), and diamond, etc., as a method for realizing further energy-conservation. These new power semiconductor-materials each had a problem in that the new power semiconductor-material was a material high in hardness, and fragile, as compared with SiC, being therefore regarded as the difficult-to-machine material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">There is available a catalyst-supported chemical machining method described in PTL 1, and PTL 2, respectively, as a conventional art whereby the respective surfaces of these difficult-to-machine materials are efficiently smoothed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The method described in PTL 1 is a method whereby a workpiece is disposed in solution of an oxidizer, and a catalyst made of a transition metal is caused to approach the worked surface of a workpiece or come into extreme proximity thereto to thereby remove or elute a compound formed due to a chemical reaction occurring between an active species having high oxidizability, having occurred on the surface of the catalyst, and an atom on the surface of the workpiece to machine the workpiece. It is described in PTL 1 that an abrasive board is used the whole or a part of which is made up of the transition metal as a working example of this method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The method described in PTL 2 is a method whereby a workpiece composed of GaN, and SiC, etc., is disposed in a process liquid in which a molecule containing a halogen, such as hydrofluoric acid, etc., is dissolved, and a catalyst and the workpiece are caused to undergo relative displacement, while rendering the catalyst made of molybdenum or a molybdenum compound to come into contact with the worked surface of the workpiece or to be in extreme proximity thereto, thereby machining the worked surface of the workpiece. In PTL 2, there is described use of a catalyst board composed of molybdenum or the molybdenum compound as a working example of this method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the method described in either of PTL 1 and PTL 2 is a method for polishing with the use of only the active species occurred from the oxidizer without using an abrasive grain.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0009">With the catalyst-supported chemical machining method described as above, if the worked surface of the workpiece is away from the catalyst, an oxidation action of the active species cannot be obtained because hydroxyl radical and hydrogen radical, as the active species having high oxidizability, formed on the surface of the catalyst, can reside for a time period of only one millionth of a second, from occurrence to disappearance. For this reason, there is the need for causing the catalyst to approach the worked surface of the workpiece or come into extreme proximity thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0010">However, if an abrasive board is made up of a catalyst metal, as in the case of the conventional art described as above, a problem will occur in that a region on the worked surface of the workpiece, approaching a catalyst or coming into extreme proximity thereto, will decrease in number for the following reason.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0011">More specifically, the abrasive board being a closely-packed bulky body made of metal, the rigidity thereof becomes higher. On the other hand, swells and microscopic asperities (roughness) on the order of a several tens of μms, in magnitude, normally exist on the worked surface of the workpiece. Accordingly, at a time when the worked surface of the workpiece and the surface of the board are put together by pressing, only the apex of each projection on the worked surface, comes into contact with the surface of the abrasive board, thereby causing miniscule gap to occur between the worked surface of the workpiece and the surface of the board. Consequently, if the abrasive board is made up of the catalyst metal, the region on the worked surface of the workpiece, coming into contact with a catalyst or coming into extreme proximity thereto, will decrease in number.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0012">As a result, it is impossible to cause the active species having high oxidizability, having occurred on the surface of the catalyst, to efficiently act on the worked surface of the workpiece, so that a processing rate at the time of smoothing the workpiece becomes lower, thereby rendering processing time longer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0013">In view of those points described as above, it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a metallic abrasive pad capable of increasing the regions, on the worked surface of a workpiece, coming into contact with a catalyst or coming into extreme proximity thereto, and a method for manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad. Further, the invention has another object of providing a catalyst-supported chemical machining method, using the metallic abrasive pad.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0014">To that end, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a metallic abrasive pad for use in a smoothing operation applied to a worked surface of a workpiece by a catalyst-supported chemical machining method, the metallic abrasive pad comprising: a compression-formed compact of a metal fiber made of a transition-metal catalyst, wherein the metallic abrasive pad has a prescribed void ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0015">Since the abrasive pad according to the invention is made up of the metal fiber so as to have voids, the metal fiber existing on a surface of the abrasive pad can undergo elastic deformation. For this reason, upon the surface of the abrasive pad according to the invention and the worked surface of the workpiece being put together by pressing, the metal fiber undergoes deformation in response to microscopic asperities existing on the worked surface, whereupon a gap occurring between the surface of the abrasive pad and the worked surface can be reduced in size. By so doing, the region, on the worked surface, coming into contact with the catalyst or into extreme proximity thereto can be increased in number, as compared with the case of the conventional art. As a result, the active species having high oxidizability, having occurred on the surface of the catalyst, can be caused to efficiently act on the worked surface of the workpiece, and the operation rate of the smoothing processing can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0016">Now, in order just to fill in the gap, it need only be sufficient to have an abrasive pad made up such that the abrasion surface thereof, in whole, can be deformed, however, if the abrasion surface, in whole, is deformed upon the worked surface being pressed against the abrasion surface, this will render the smoothing processing difficult to perform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0017">In contrast to the above, since the abrasive pad according to the first aspect of the invention includes the compression-formed compact composed of the metal fiber, the abrasive pad as a whole is high in rigidity, so that deformation of the abrasion surface in whole can be checked when the worked surface is pressed against the abrasion surface. Accordingly, use of the abrasive pad according to the invention enables a high-precision smoothing operation to be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0018">In a second aspect of the invention according to the first aspect, it is preferable that the metal fiber has a diameter falling in a range of 1 μm to 500 μm. In this case, it becomes easy to uniformly perform compression compact forming at high density at the time of manufacturing the compression-formed compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0019">In a third aspect of the invention according to the third aspect, the void ratio is preferably set to not less than 10% and not more than 90%. In this case, the compression-formed compact can be easily formed, and the strength of the compression-formed compact can be secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0020">In a fourth aspect of the invention according to the first aspect, it is preferable that the compression-formed compact preferably has a compression recovery ratio falling in a range of 90% to 100%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0021">Herein, the compression recovery ratio can be defined by the following equation in which T1 is a thickness of the metallic abrasive pad when an abrasion load 300 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied to the surface of the metallic abrasive pad for 10 sec, T2 is a thickness of the metallic abrasive pad when an abrasion load 1800 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied to the surface of the metallic abrasive pad for 10 sec, and T3 is a thickness of the metallic abrasive pad when the abrasion load 300 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied to the surface of the metallic abrasive pad for 10 sec after the abrasion load 1800 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied to the surface of the metallic abrasive pad for 10 sec.
<br/>
Compression Recovery Ratio (%)=(<i>T</i>3<i>−T</i>2)/(<i>T</i>1<i>−T</i>2)×100
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0022">If the compression recovery ratio is not less than 90%, it is possible to cause the metallic abrasive pad to sufficiently come into extreme proximity to the worked surface of a workpiece, or come into contact thereto halfway through a smoothing operation even in the case where swells and roughness exist on the worked surface of the workpiece prior to application of the smoothing operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0023">In a fifth aspect of the invention according to the first aspect, the metal fiber can include metal or alloy, the metal being made of one species selected from a group of nickel, copper, iron, chromium, cobalt, and platinum, the alloy being made of combination of at least two species selected from the group. If the material of the metal fiber, that is, the species of the catalyst is selected so as to match up with the oxidation nature of the workpiece, it is possible to adjust a processing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0024">In a sixth aspect of the invention according to the first aspect, it is preferable that the compression-formed compact is preferably provided with a first metal fiber, and a second metal fiber differing in material from the first metal fiber. Thus, if the respective materials of the metal fibers, that is, the respective species of the catalysts are combined with each other to be thereby selected so as to match up with the oxidation nature of the workpiece, this will enable a processing rate to be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0025">In a second aspect of the invention according to the first aspect, it is preferable that the compression-formed compact is made up such that one face becomes an abrasion surface, and a cushion sheet having rubber elasticity is provided on the other face, wherein the other face is at the opposite side of said one face. With this feature, a processing pressure impressed on the worked surface, at the time of application of the catalyst-supported chemical machining, can be rendered uniform by the cushion sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0026">In an eighth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad according to any of the first to seventh aspect, the method including: a primary forming step for applying hot pressing to a metal fiber made of a transition-metal catalyst to form a primary formed compact; and a secondary forming step for applying isostatic pressing to the primary formed compact at an ordinary temperature to form a secondary formed compact, wherein the metal fiber is fixed to each other by means of sintering in the primary forming step, and in the secondary forming step, the isostatic pressing is applied in a state where one face of the primary formed compact is covered with a forming material that is undeformable at a hydrostatic pressure, and a remaining face of the primary formed compact is covered with a coating material that is deformable at a hydrostatic pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0027">Incidentally, in the case of manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad by singly applying a hot pressing or a hot isostatic pressing, in contrast to the present invention, the flatness of the formed compact undergoes deterioration, and the void ratio as well becomes non-uniform because of the effects of contraction of the formed compact, due to sintering, and distortion occurring to both the forming material and the formed compact, due to thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0028">In contrast, with the present invention, the isostatic pressing is applied at an ordinary temperature hardly affected by the distortion occurring to both the forming material, and the formed compact, due to the thermal expansion after the metal fiber is sintered to each other by a hot pressing, so that high-flatness of the formed compact can be secured. Further, since a uniform pressure is applied from a side of the primary formed compact, adjacent to the coating material, toward the forming material, at the time of the isostatic pressing in the secondary forming step, the flat shape of the forming material can be precisely transferred to the primary formed compact, and portions of the metallic abrasive pad, at any site, can have a uniform void ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0029">Further, with the isostatic pressing in the secondary forming step, since a forming operation is applied at an ordinary temperature, there is no need for use of the hot isostatic pressing unit requiring much energy at a high cost. Accordingly, with respect to the forming material as well, there is no need for preparing a material particularly high in heat resistance, and for the forming material, a material somewhat harder than a material selected as the metal fiber is sufficient for use, so that the metallic abrasive pad can be manufactured at an industrially low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0030">In a ninth aspect of the invention, there is provided a catalyst-supported chemical machining method for applying a smoothing operation to a worked surface of a workpiece made of a difficult-to-machine material, comprising: putting an abrasion surface of the metallic abrasive pad according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>7</b> and the worked surface together by pressing; and causing the workpiece and the metallic abrasive pad to undergo relative displacement, while feeding an oxidizer between the worked surface and the abrasion surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0031">With this invention, the same effect as with the case of the first aspect of the invention can be obtained because the metallic abrasive pad in the first aspect is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0032">In a tenth aspect of the invention according to the ninth aspect, a supplementary abrasive particle and the oxidizer are fed together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0033">According to the invention described as above, a surface modification layer of the workpiece, having occurred by the active species, can be efficiently removed because the supplementary abrasive particle is fed, as compared with the case where the processing is applied with the use of the active species only, as is the case with the conventional art. If, in an eleventh aspect, a material softer than the workpiece is used for the supplementary abrasive particle, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a linear trace on the workpiece. In addition, if, in a twelfth aspect of the invention, a material harder than the surface modification layer of workpiece is used as the supplementary abrasive particle, it is possible to increase processing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0034">The ninth to twelfth aspects of the invention is especially effective if, in the thirteenth aspect of the invention, the difficult-to-machine material is any one selected from the group consisting of SiC, GaN, diamond, sapphire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0035">In a fourteenth aspect of the invention according to the ninth to thirteenth aspects, solution of one species selected from the group consisting of pure water, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid, and hydrofluoric acid, or a mixed solution composed of combination of at least two species selected from the group described as above, can be used for the oxidizer. If the species of the oxidizer is selected so as to match up with the oxidation nature of the workpiece, this will enable a processing rate to be adjusted. With this feature, processing accuracy can be easily adjusted.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0056">Embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0057">First, there are described both a catalyst-supported chemical machining unit and a catalyst-supported chemical machining method, according the first embodiment of the invention. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is depicted a conceptual view of a chemical machining unit in which a catalyst-supported chemical machining with the use of the metallic abrasive pad according to the invention is executed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0058">The chemical machining unit is provided with a board <b>1</b>, a metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, a holder <b>3</b>, a first nozzle <b>4</b>, and a second nozzle <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0059">The board <b>1</b> has an upper surface which is flat, being rotatable around a rotation shaft perpendicular to the upper surface. The metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is attached to the upper surface of the board <b>1</b>. The metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> has an abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>wider in area than a worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of a workpiece <b>6</b>. The holder <b>3</b> holds the workpiece <b>6</b> made of a difficult-to-machine material. The holder <b>3</b> is rotatable around the rotation shaft thereof, provided so as to be in parallel with the rotation shaft of the board <b>1</b>, and eccentrically thereto. In this connection, both the board <b>1</b> and the holder <b>3</b> are rotatable, however, the chemical machining unit may be made up such that only one of these elements can rotate. Further, the respective rotation directions of the board <b>1</b> and the holder <b>3</b> may be either the same or differ from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0060">The first nozzle <b>4</b> is a first feeder for feeding an oxidizer between the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> and the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b>. The second nozzle <b>5</b> is a second feeder for feeding a supplementary abrasive particle between the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> and the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0061">By “a difficult-to-machine material” in the present description is meant a material which is difficult to machine under a mechanically strong condition because the material is high in hardness and fragile. By “high in hardness” is meant higher in hardness than Si, and so forth. In the case where the difficult-to-machine material is any material selected from the group consisting of SiC, GaN, diamond, sapphire, and ruby, among those difficult-to-machine materials, the industrial value thereof is particularly high. However, a material making up the workpiece is not limited to the difficult-to-machine material, and any material that can be machined by the catalyst-supported chemical machining method will suffice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0062">The oxidizer, may be solution of one species selected from the group consisting of pure water, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid, and hydrofluoric acid, or a mixed solution made up of combination of at least two species selected from the group described as above. The oxidizer is selected from among plural species of oxidizers capable of causing an optimum catalytic reaction to occur to the difficult-to-machine material to be machined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0063">The supplementary abrasive particle is a supplementary machining material for use in removal of a surface modification layer formed on the surface of the workpiece, as described later on. For the supplementary abrasive particle, a particle softer than the workpiece is used, and more preferably, a particle softer than the workpiece, and harder than the surface modification layer of the workpiece is used. If the hardness of the supplementary abrasive particle is set so as to be lower than that of the workpiece, the surface modification layer can be removed without damaging the surface of the workpiece, thereby enabling a new catalytic reaction to be fostered. If the hardness of the supplementary abrasive particle is set so as to be higher than that of the surface modification layer, and lower than that of the workpiece, this will enable machining to be executed at a high machining rate without damaging a workpiece material. For the material of the supplementary abrasive particle, for example, alumina, boron carbide, and silica, etc can be used. The particle size of the supplementary abrasive particle may be selected depending on the material of the workpiece material, or smoothness obtained after machining, and there is no particular limitation thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0064">Next, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is described hereunder. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a section in parallel with the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows a section perpendicular to the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0065">The metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is made up of a compression-formed compact of a metal fiber <b>21</b> made of a transition-metal catalyst, having a prescribed void ratio. The compression-formed compact is formed into a compact by applying heating and compression to the metal fiber in a flocculent state. The metal fiber in the flocculent state is made up of one length of the metal fiber or plural lengths of the metal fibers. Further, a method for manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is described in detail later on in this description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0066">More specifically, with the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b> intersects with the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b> to be sintered together at an intersection spot <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, whereupon the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b> are fixed to the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b>, as show in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>a</i>)</figref>. Further, the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> has high flatness, as show in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>b</i>)</figref>. In other words, the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b> is arranged in such a way as to form a flat surface on the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a</i>. Still further, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is made up of the metal fiber(s) <b>21</b> substantially uniform in diameter, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>a</i>)</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(<i>b</i>)</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0067">The diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, serving as the raw material of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, falling in a range of 1 to 500 μm is suitable. If the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b> is in excess of 500 μm, the strength of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, on its own, will be excessively high, so that it becomes difficult to uniformly form a high-density compression-formed compact. Unless the metal fiber <b>21</b> can be turned into the compression-formed compact at high-density, it is impossible to satisfactorily obtain the effect of increasing a surface area for causing the occurrence of the catalytic reaction, that is, one of the objects of transforming the raw material into a fiber, thereby causing a decrease in the advantage of using the metal fiber <b>21</b> as the raw material. Since it is possible these days to manufacture a metal fiber extremely small in diameter, up to 1 μm in diameter, by a focused drawing method, the metal fiber <b>21</b>, not less than 1 μm in diameter, can be put to use. However, the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, not less than 10 μm, is more preferable for the following reason. In the case where the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b> is less than 10 μm, it takes a high cost to manufacture the metal fiber <b>21</b> as the raw material. Furthermore, in this case, the activity of the metal fiber <b>21</b> being excessively high upon heating the same in a compact-forming step as described later on, the metal fiber <b>21</b> is oxidized by oxygen in the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0068">Further, “the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b>” in the present description means an equivalent-circle diameter, as calculated on the basis of a sectional area of the metal fiber <b>21</b>. Further, the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, described as above, indicates an average value of diameters, each of the diameters being a diameter per one length of the metal fiber for use as the raw material. In the case where the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is manufactured by use of plural lengths of the metal fibers <b>21</b>, adiameter falling in a range of 1 to 500 μm, with respect to all the plural lengths of the metal fibers <b>21</b>, is suitable for use. Further, because the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b> after manufacturing of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is substantially equal to the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b> before manufacturing of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, described as above, means the diameter of the metal fiber <b>21</b> making up the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0069">The void ratio of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is in a prescribed range neither too small nor too large. If the void ratio is too small, this will prevent the metal fiber <b>21</b> from undergoing an elastic deformation, so that when the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> and the workpiece <b>6</b> are put together by pressing, the region, existing on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, coming into contact with a catalyst or coming into extreme proximity thereto, will be decreased in number. Further, if the void ratio is too small, this will render it difficult for the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, opposite to the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b>, to sufficiently hold the oxidizer and the supplementary abrasive particle, for use in processing. On the other hand, if the void ratio is too large, this will prevent a reaction surface area for causing the occurrence of the active species having oxidizability from being enlarged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0070">More specifically, the void ratio of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is set to fall in a range of 10 to 90%. The reason for this is because the result of experiments conducted by the inventor, whereby various compression-formed compacts were machined so as to have a variety of void ratios, indicated that the void ratio less than 10% was difficult to implement, whereas if the void ratio was in excess of 90%, it was impossible to maintain the shape of the compression-formed compact upon removal of a forming tool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0071">A compression recovery ratio of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, falling in a range of 90 to 100%, is suitable although the compression recovery ratio varies depending on the diameter of the metal fiber, and a formation-density of the formed compact, at the time of forming a compression-compact. The reason for this is because, if the compression recovery ratio is less than 90%, it will be difficult to cause the whole surfaces of the metallic abrasive pad and the workpiece, respectively, to come into uniform contact with each other at the time of machining being applied to both the metallic abrasive pad and the workpiece, in a pressed state, whereupon localized contact will result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0072">The metal fiber is, for example, made up of metal or alloy, wherein the metal is made of one species selected from a group of nickel, copper, iron, chromium, cobalt, and platinum, and the alloy is made of combination of at least two species selected from the group consisting of titanium, nickel, copper, iron, chromium, cobalt, and platinum. The material of the metal fiber is selected from among plural species of metal stocks that are capable of causing an optimum catalytic reaction to occur to a difficult-to-machine material to be machined. With the present embodiment, all the qualities (materials) of the metal fiber making up the compression-formed compact are identical to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0073">Next, there is described a method for manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow chart depicting the steps of manufacturing the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>. The metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is manufactured by taking a raw-material preparation step S<b>1</b>, a primary forming step S<b>2</b>, and a secondary forming step S<b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0074">In the raw-material preparation step S<b>1</b>, a metal fiber composed of a transition-metal catalyst, serving as the raw material of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, is prepared. The numbers of the metal fibers prepared at this point in time may be either plural lengths or one length, and in the case of using the plural lengths, relatively long ones are preferably used. This is recommendable in order to prevent dropping of the metal fiber from occurring at the time of the smoothing operation according to the catalyst-supported chemical machining method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0075">In the primary forming step S<b>2</b>, the metal fiber is subjected to the hot pressing to thereby form a primary formed compact (a precursor compact). At this point in time, the metal fiber is flocculently disposed inside a forming tool to thereby apply heating and pressing thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0076">A heating temperature is a temperature at which a contact spot of the metal fibers intersecting each other is sintered to be thereby solidified. For example, in the case where the metal fiber is made of titanium, the heating temperature is set to not lower than 700° C. and not higher than 1000° C. If a compact-forming temperature is lower than 700° C., deformation of the metal fiber will be insufficient, and the density of the compact will be uneven, so that it is not possible to obtain a formed compact that can be used for the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>. If the compact-forming temperature is in excess of 1000° C., the metal fibers are locally sintered to each other to be fused and connected before undergoing contraction. As a result, the surface area of the formed compact will become smaller, and the effect of increasing a catalytic reaction area, as intended by use of the metal fiber as the raw material, will be reduced. Further, if the sintering of the formed compact excessively proceeds, the formed compact itself will undergo contraction in size, and it will become difficult to secure the size accuracy of the formed compact, so that it becomes difficult to obtain the shape of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, capable of securing intimate contact with the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0077">Further, for a hot pressing method, use is preferably made of a vacuum hot pressing method capable of checking the oxidation of the metal fiber making up the precursor compact in the case where the metal fiber is susceptible to oxidation, and having no risk of occurrence of poor machining, caused by entrainment of air into the formed compact. By so doing, it is possible to obtain the formed compact large in a surface area where a catalytic reaction is caused to occur, and excellent in size accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0078">In the secondary forming step S<b>3</b>, the primary formed compact is subjected to a isostatic pressing at an ordinary temperature to thereby form a secondary formed compact. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a state of the primary formed compact at a time when a isostatic pressing is applied in the secondary forming step S<b>3</b>. More specifically, the isostatic pressing is applied to the primary formed compact in a state in which one face <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the primary formed compact <b>10</b> is covered with a forming material <b>11</b> that is undeformable at a hydrostatic pressure at the time of the isostatic pressing, and remaining faces of the primary formed compact <b>10</b>, including another face <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, are covered with a coating material <b>12</b> that is deformable, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. By so doing, the one face <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the primary formed compact <b>10</b> is rendered flatter. The one face <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the primary formed compact <b>10</b> will serve as the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0079">For the forming material <b>11</b>, a forming material having high rigidity, composed of iron, aluminum, and glass, etc can be used. For the coating material <b>12</b>, a sheet-like material composed of an elastic material such as rubber, and so forth can be used. In the secondary forming step S<b>3</b>, there is no need at all for preparing a special heat-resistant material for use in a forming tool, such a material as used in the hot isostatic pressing. By “an ordinary temperature” described as above is meant the temperature of a material in unheated state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0080">Now, in contrast to the present embodiment, if the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is manufactured by singly applying the hot pressing or the hot isostatic pressing, the flatness of the formed compact will be deteriorated because of the effects of contraction of the formed compact, due to sintering, and distortion occurring to the forming material as well as the formed compact, due to thermal expansion, whereupon the void ratio as well will become non-uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0081">In contrast to this, with the present embodiment, the metal fibers are sintered to each other by hot pressing, and subsequently, the isostatic pressing hardly affected by the distortion, due to the thermal expansion of the forming material as well as the formed compact is applied at an ordinary temperature, so that it is possible to secure high flatness of the formed compact. Further, with the isostatic pressing in the secondary forming step S<b>3</b>, since a uniform pressure is applied from a side of the primary formed compact, adjacent to the coating material <b>12</b>, toward the forming material <b>11</b>, the flat shape of the forming material <b>11</b> can be precisely transferred to the compact, and portions of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>, at any site, can have a uniform void ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0082">Furthermore, with the isostatic pressing in the secondary forming step S<b>3</b>, since compact-forming is executed at an ordinary temperature, there is no need for use of the hot isostatic pressing unit requiring much energy at a high cost. Accordingly, with respect to the forming material <b>11</b> as well, there is no need for preparing a material particularly high in heat resistance, and for the forming material <b>11</b>, use of a material somewhat harder than the material selected, as the metal fiber, is sufficient, so that the metallic abrasive pad can be manufactured at an industrially low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0083">Next, there is described below the catalyst-supported chemical machining method, using the machining unit described as above. The worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b> and the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> are put together by pressing, while driving the board <b>1</b> and the holder <b>3</b>, respectively, for rotation. Then, the oxidizer from the first nozzle <b>4</b>, and the supplementary abrasive particle from the second nozzle <b>5</b> are each fed between the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0084">At this point in time, an active species having high oxidizability occurs from the oxidizer, on the surface of the metal fibers making up the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>. For example, in the case where the metal fiber is composed of titanium, and hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidizer, hydroxyl radical occurs due to Fenton reaction. The surface layer of the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>is modified into an oxidized layer by the active species, that is, a surface modification layer is formed on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>. Subsequently, the surface modification layer is scraped off by the supplementary abrasive particle. Thus, the smoothing processing is applied to the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0085">Next, the main feature of the present embodiment is described below. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(<i>a</i>), 5(<i>b</i>), and 5(<i>c</i>)</figref> each show an enlarged vies of a portion of the workpiece, in the vicinity of the worked surface, when each of various abrasive pads and the workpiece are put together by pressing, in the respective cases of the present embodiment, comparative example 1, and comparative example 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0086">The comparative example 1 shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(<i>b</i>)</figref> is an example in which an abrasive board J<b>1</b> composed of the catalyst metal is used, described under the column Technical Problem. Upon the abrasive board J<b>1</b> and the workpiece <b>6</b> being put together by pressing, the abrasive board J<b>1</b> does not undergo deformation in response to microscopic asperities existing on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b> because of high rigidity of the abrasive board J<b>1</b>. For this reason, a miniscule gap is caused to occur between the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the surface of the abrasive board J<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0087">In contrast, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> according to the present embodiment is made up of the metal fibers <b>21</b>, having voids, so that the metal fibers existing on the abrasive pad surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>can undergo elastic deformation. For this reason, if the abrasive pad surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>6</b> are put together by pressing, the abrasive pad surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is deformed in response to the microscopic asperities existing on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, thereby enabling a gap occurring between the abrasive pad surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>to be smaller, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In other words, the metal fiber <b>21</b> in contact with each projection of the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, on the metallic abrasive pad surface <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, is pressed, whereupon a portion of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, opposed to a recess of the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, enters the recess. By so doing, a region, on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, coming into contact with the catalyst or into extreme proximity thereto can be increased in number, as compared with the working example 1. As a result, the active species having high oxidizability, having occurred on the surface of the catalyst, can be caused to efficiently act on the worked surface of the workpiece. In short, the surface modification layer can be speedily formed on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, and the processing rate of the smoothing processing can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0088">The comparative example 2 shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(<i>c</i>)</figref> is an example in which an abrasive pad J<b>2</b> having high flexibility is used. The abrasive pad J<b>2</b> is not composed of the catalyst metal, but the same is made up of a non-woven fabric made of, for example, polyurethane resin. In the case where the abrasive pad J<b>2</b> according to comparative example 2 and the workpiece <b>6</b> are put together by pressing, an abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a </i>is deformed in response to microscopic asperities existing on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, whereupon a gap between the abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>can be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0089">In this case, however, the abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a </i>undergoes deformation upon the same being pressed by the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>because of excessively high flexibility of the abrasive pad J<b>2</b>. More specifically, if the abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a </i>is larger than the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, a portion of the abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a</i>, at sites opposite to the edge of the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, will be deformed, upon the abrasive pad surface J<b>2</b> <i>a </i>being pressed by the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, application of the smoothing processing to the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>will become difficult to implement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0090">In contrast thereto, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> according to the present embodiment is made up of the compression-formed compact of the metal fiber <b>21</b>, and therefore, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> as a whole has a high rigidity, so that it is possible to check the deformation of the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, occurring upon the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>being pressed against the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a</i>. In other words, upon the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>being pressed against the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>can maintain high flatness. Accordingly, the use of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> according to the present embodiment enables high-precision smoothing processing to be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0091">Further, with the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> according to the present embodiment, the catalyst metal is in a fiber-like shape, 500 μm or less, in diameter, having voids around a fiber, so that a reaction surface area for causing the occurrence of the active species having oxidizability can be rendered larger as compared with the case where the catalyst metal is in a dense bulky-shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0092">Still further, with the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> according to the present embodiment, since the voids exist on the abrasion surface, the abrasion surface can hold both the oxidizer and the supplementary abrasive particle, in amount sufficient for application of the processing to the worked surface of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0093">Yet further, with the catalyst-supported chemical machining method according to the present embodiment, not only the oxidizer but also the supplementary abrasive particle are fed between the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the abrasion surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>to thereby remove the surface modification layer of the workpiece <b>6</b>. For this reason, with the present embodiment, the surface modification layer of the workpiece can be efficiently removed, as compared with the case where the processing is executed with the use of the active species only, as is the case with the conventional art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0094">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a metallic abrasive pad as well as a board, in a catalyst-supported chemical machining unit according to a second embodiment of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0095">With the first embodiment, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is attached directly to the board <b>1</b>, however, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> may be attached to the board <b>1</b> with a cushion sheet <b>13</b> having rubber elasticity interposed therebetween. More specifically, the cushion sheet <b>13</b> may be provided on a surface (the other face) <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, on the opposite side of the abrasion surface (one face) <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0096">By so doing, a processing pressure impressed on the worked surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, at the time of application of the catalyst-supported chemical machining, can be rendered uniform by the cushion sheet <b>13</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0097">The respective qualities of metal fibers making up a compression-formed compact are not limited to the case where all the metal fibers are of the same material, and the metal fibers may differ in material from each other.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0098">If the respective qualities of the metal fibers, that is, plural spices of the catalysts, are combined before selected so as to match up with the oxidation nature of the workpiece, this will enable the processing rate to be adjusted.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0099">(1) With the first embodiment, the supplementary abrasive particle is fed from the second nozzle <b>5</b> at the time of application of the catalyst-supported chemical machining, however, the catalyst-supported chemical machining may be applied without feeding the supplementary abrasive particle, as is the case with conventional art described in PTL 1, and PTL 2, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0100">(2) With the first embodiment, the catalyst-supported chemical machining unit is structured so as to drive both the workpiece <b>6</b> and the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> for a rotational movement, however, the unit may be structured so as to drive at least either of the workpiece <b>6</b> and the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> for a linear reciprocating-motion. In short, if the catalyst-supported chemical machining unit is structured so as to cause the workpiece <b>6</b> and the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> to be driven for relative displacement, this will suffice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0101">(3) With the first embodiment, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> is made up of the metal fiber <b>21</b> having a diameter of one species in magnitude, however, the metallic abrasive pad <b>2</b> may be made up of the metal fibers <b>21</b> having respective diameters of plural species in magnitude.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0107">Subsequently, a precursor compact was formed under a compact-forming condition shown in Table 2 by a uniaxial vacuum hot-press (the primary forming step S<b>2</b>). At this point in time, the target density of the precursor compact was set by a reverse operation of a compressibility ratio of the secondary forming step, and a target void ratio of a metallic abrasive pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0108">More specifically, if the target void ratio of the metallic abrasive pad was 36%, a compression compact-forming stroke in the uniaxial vacuum hot-press was adjusted such that the void ratio will become 45%, which is slightly higher than the target. The reason for setting the void ratio to a void ratio slightly higher than the target void ratio is because there is the need for the target void ratio taking the formability of a isostatic pressing for final compact-forming into consideration. If the density of a formed compact after the uniaxial vacuum hot-pressing is excessively high, a deformation volume in the isostatic pressing will decrease, thereby rendering it difficult to even out the respective densities of the formed compacts. Conversely, if the density of the formed compact after the uniaxial vacuum hot-pressing is excessively low, the deformation volume in the isostatic pressing will increase, thereby preventing the formed compact from being compressed to a target formation density, so that a compressive residual stress occurs to the formed compact to thereby cause the formed compact to undergo a large deformation.</div>

Upon comparison of the roughness curve before the application of the smoothing operation with the roughness curve after the application of the smoothing operation, it is evident that the shape of each crest in the roughness curve has varied in shape from an acute angle to a round shape, whereas the shape of each trough in the roughness curve is kept in an acute angle. Accordingly, it can be confirmed from the respective roughness curves before and after the application of the smoothing operation that only projections in the roughness of the SiC wafer surface before the application of the smoothing operation was selectively processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0119">This demonstrates that, in the case of a common polishing with the use of diamond slurry, the roughness of an SiC wafer surface, including both the projection and the recess, is simultaneously processed, thereby requiring a high processing charge until the target surface-roughness is attained, however, with the method for processing the SiC wafer, using the metallic abrasive pad according to the invention, it is possible to selectively process only the projection, so that processing can be implemented without requiring the high processing charge, proving that this processing is efficient.</div>

Upon comparison of the surface state before the smoothing operation with the surface state after the smoothing operation, it can be observed that a large number of linear traces exist on the SiC wafer surface before the smoothing operation, whereas the linear traces decreases in number after the smoothing operation, and a number of smoothed surfaces can be seen on the SiC wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0121">Incidentally, in the case of the common polishing with the use of diamond slurry, linear traces are left out without fail on a smoothed surface, as well, the linear traces being ones having occurred due to damages inflicted by diamond particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0122">In contrast, with the method for processing the SiC wafer, using the metallic abrasive pad according to the invention, the linear trace does not exist at all on the smoothed surface, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(<i>b</i>)</figref>. The reason for this is because the processing of the SiC wafer is mostly implemented by chemical action, thereby proving that the surface of the SiC wafer can be formed without causing any defect attributable to the processing, at all, having no defect, that is, without a damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(<i>c</i>), 11(<i>c</i>)</figref> show the roughness curve of the SiC wafer surface, and an observation photograph of the SiC wafer surface, obtained by the laser microscope, after further application of the smoothing operation to the SiC wafer surface in states shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(<i>b</i>), 11(<i>b</i>)</figref>, respectively.
