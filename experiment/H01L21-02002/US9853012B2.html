<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Example embodiments of the inventive concept relate to a semiconductor product, and in particular, to semiconductor packages having through electrodes and methods of fabricating the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a semiconductor package has been realized using a wire bonding technology. Recently, a through-silicon via (TSV) technology was suggested to meet an increasing demand for high performance. According to the conventional TSV technology, an wafer is bonded to a carrier using an adhesives layer, and then, the carrier is de-bonded from the wafer, after a polishing process to a backside surface of the wafer. Likewise, additional steps of handling the carrier are needed, and thus, the conventional TSV technology suffers from low productivity and high fabrication cost.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be noted that these figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below. These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment, and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown. Example embodiments of the inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of example embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. In the drawings, the thicknesses of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly connected” or “directly coupled” to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers indicate like elements throughout. As used herein the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., “between” versus “directly between,” “adjacent” versus “directly adjacent,” “on” versus “directly on”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be understood that, although the terms “first”, “second”, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises”, “comprising”, “includes” and/or “including,” if used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments of the inventive concepts should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which example embodiments of the inventive concepts belong. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly-used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a plurality of first semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may be stacked, in a chip-on-wafer (COW) manner, on a second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The first semiconductor chip <b>100</b> may include a first semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> having a front surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>and a back surface <b>101</b> <i>b</i>, a first integrated circuit layer <b>103</b> provided on the front surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the first semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>, and one or more first through electrodes <b>121</b> vertically penetrating a portion of the first semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> to be electrically connected to the first integrated circuit layer <b>103</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> may include the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> having a front surface <b>201</b> <i>a </i>and a back surface <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, a second integrated circuit layer <b>203</b> provided on the front surface <b>201</b> <i>a </i>of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b>, and one or more second through electrodes <b>221</b> vertically penetrating a portion of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> to be electrically connected to the second integrated circuit layer <b>203</b>. The second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> may be provided in the form of a wafer (or in wafer-level) and be formed of a semiconductor material (e.g., silicon). The second integrated circuit layer <b>203</b> may include a memory circuit, a logic circuit, or any combination thereof. The second through electrode <b>221</b> may be provided, in a via-first or via-middle manner, on the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The first semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may be stacked, in the front-to-front manner, on the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> and be electrically connected to the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>. For example, the first semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may be bonded in a flip-chip manner on the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, and thus, the front surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the first semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> may face the front surface <b>201</b> <i>a </i>of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b>. First connection electrodes <b>123</b> (e.g., provided in the form of a solder ball) are provided between the first semiconductor chip <b>100</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> to electrically connect the first integrated circuit layer <b>103</b> to the second integrated circuit layer <b>203</b>. In another example embodiment, the first connection electrodes <b>123</b> are not provided between the first semiconductor chip <b>100</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> to electrically connect the first integrated circuit layer <b>103</b> to the second integrated circuit layer <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">An example embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is shown in a plan view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1P</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a first mold layer <b>601</b> may be formed on the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, and then, the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> may be thinned. For example, the first mold layer <b>601</b> may be formed on the front surface <b>201</b> <i>a </i>of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> to cover the first semiconductor chips <b>100</b>, and then, the back surface <b>201</b> <i>b </i>of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> may be thinned by a mechanical process such as polishing. In an example embodiment, the polishing may be performed by a grinder. Other processes to thin the back surface <b>201</b> <i>b </i>may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The first mold layer <b>601</b> may be formed to have a thickness to provide rigidity to the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> from being bent, during performing the back-side polishing on the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>. The first mold layer <b>601</b> may include an insulating material or a polymer material (e.g., an epoxy resin). The first mold layer <b>601</b> may include an epoxy filler composite that is formed to have a thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) similar to that of silicon. For example, given than the CTE of silicon is about 3 ppm/° C., the epoxy filler composite may be formed to have a CTE of about 5-7 ppm/° C. In an example embodiment, the CTE of the substrate of the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> and the CTE of the first mold layer <b>601</b> are within an order of magnitude. In another example embodiment, a ratio of the CTE of the substrate of the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> and a CTE of the first mold layer <b>601</b> is in a range from 1 to 3. In example embodiments, the epoxy filler composite may include a mixture of an epoxy resin and silica that is formed to have a silica content of about 80 wt %. Likewise, in the case where the CTE of the first mold layer <b>601</b> is similar to that of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b>, it may be possible to prevent or suppress the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> from bending.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">To reduce a thickness of the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, the back surface <b>201</b> <i>b </i>of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> may be polished by a grinder <b>90</b>, while the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b> is supported by the first mold layer <b>601</b>. As the result of the back-side polishing on the second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> may be thinned to have a recessed back surface <b>201</b> <i>c </i>exposing the second through electrodes <b>221</b> in a via-first manner. In example embodiments, the first mold layer <b>601</b> may be used as a carrier in the back-side polishing process. This may make it possible to omit additional processes of bonding and debonding a carrier. In example embodiment, a carrier is not bonded to the first nor the second semiconductor chips <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, so a subsequent debonding of the carrier is not necessary. As a consequence of omitting the bonding and debonding of a carrier, at least two steps in the fabrication process are eliminated and allows for reduced cost and time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, back-side electrodes <b>223</b> may be formed on the recessed back surface <b>201</b> <i>c</i>, i.e. the thinned back surface, of the second semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> in a via-middle manner. The back-side electrodes <b>223</b> may be electrically connected to the second through electrodes <b>221</b>, respectively, and each of the back-side electrodes <b>223</b> may be provided in the form of a pad. As the result of the above described processes, the plurality of first semiconductor chips <b>100</b> encapsulated with the first mold layer <b>601</b> may be stacked in a chip-on-wafer (COW) manner on the wafer-level second semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, thereby forming a first wafer-level package <b>1</b> having a 2-height stacked micropillar grid array structure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">According to example embodiments of the inventive concept, it is possible to perform a wafer polishing process without the use of an additional carrier. Accordingly, it is possible to omit additional processes of bonding and debonding a carrier and thereby to improve productivity and reduce fabrication cost. Since a mold layer to be formed on a wafer has a thermal expansion coefficient similar to that of the wafer, it is possible to prevent or suppress a bending or warp of the wafer and, consequently, process failures. In addition, the wafer molding technology according to example embodiments of the inventive concept can be applied to realize various ways (e.g., via-first, via-middle, and via-last processes) for forming the through electrode or TSV.</div>
