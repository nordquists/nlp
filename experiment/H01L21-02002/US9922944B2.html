<heading id="h-0001">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device by etching the reverse surface of a semiconductor wafer with a chemical liquid, while protecting the front surface thereof with a surface protection film.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">With advances in compactification and increased density in semiconductors, such as LSIs, particular progress has been made in recent years in compactification and increased density in the thickness direction of semiconductor devices, by three-dimensional mounting, for instance. In conjunction with this, in a step for manufacturing a semiconductor device, reverse surface processing is carried out to process the reverse surface on the opposite side to the front surface on which the device is formed, for instance, a step for reducing the thickness of the semiconductor wafer. Furthermore, also in a power device such as an IGBT, MOSFET or diode, which is mounted on an inverter circuit or uninterrupted power source device, etc. which is used for driving an industrial or automobile motor, a thickness reduction step is carried out on the semiconductor wafer, in order to improve the activation performance, such as the on characteristics. Moreover, forming an impurity layer or reverse surface electrode, etc. is also carried out as reverse surface processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, after first carrying out mechanical polishing of the reverse surface side as a reserve surface process on the semiconductor wafer, a semiconductor wafer thickness reduction process is carried out by chemical etching using a chemical liquid in order to remove stress and fractured layers from the polishing. As a pre-process for this step, a surface protection film is formed in order to protect the device on the front surface side from scratches and chemical liquid. The chemical etching process after the mechanical polishing is carried out by rotary wafer etching in which chemical liquid is supplied to one side only, while rotating the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, due to the surface tension of the chemical liquid, the chemical liquid also flows around to the outer peripheral section of the surface on the opposite side to the etching process surface, and the chemical liquid penetrates in between the surface of the semiconductor wafer and the protection film. Consequently, there is a problem in that the protection film in the outer peripheral section detaches, and the yield rate of the device declines due to conveyance errors and processing defects of the semiconductor wafer in post-processing, and scratching of the device surface and corrosion by the chemical liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to avoid corrosion of the surface by the chemical liquid, it has been proposed that the diameter of the surface protection film be made larger than the device surface and smaller than the diameter of the periphery of the semiconductor wafer (see, for example, PTL 1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram for describing a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Firstly, a silicon oxide film <b>2</b> is formed on the front surface of a silicon wafer <b>1</b>. Next, an aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is formed on the silicon oxide film <b>2</b>. The aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is also formed on the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. The silicon oxide film <b>2</b> is an interlayer insulating film for insulating the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> from the silicon wafer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Next, a silicon nitride film <b>4</b> for protecting the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is formed on the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b>. The silicon nitride film <b>4</b> is formed to the inside of the end portion of the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b>, and is not formed on the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. The silicon oxide film <b>2</b>, the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> and the silicon nitride film <b>4</b> are a portion of the device that is formed on the front surface of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. These films are formed by respectively varying the edge rinse width in the resist application step, but may also be formed by exposure and development of the resist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Next, a surface protection film <b>5</b> of polyimide is formed so as to cover the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> and the silicon nitride film <b>4</b>. In this case, the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> and the surface protection film <b>5</b> are adhered to each other in the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. Next, reverse surface processing for etching the reverse surface of the silicon wafer <b>1</b> with a chemical liquid after mechanical polishing in the wafer thickness reduction step is carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">As a result of evaluation of the respective films which constitute the device in respect of their adhesion to the polyimide surface protection film <b>5</b>, aluminum had the highest adhesion, and the silicon nitride film had the lowest adhesion. Therefore, the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> has a higher adhesion to the surface protection film <b>5</b> than the silicon nitride film <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan diagram illustrating a front surface side during reverse surface processing of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <b>6</b> is a device region, of which the outermost surface is covered with a surface protection film <b>5</b>. <b>7</b> is a region where the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> and the surface protection film <b>5</b> are adhered to each other, which is disposed so as to surround the whole outer periphery of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. <b>8</b> is a region where the silicon wafer <b>1</b> and the surface protection film <b>5</b> are adhered to each other on the outside of the end portion of the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, the effects of the present embodiment are described in relation to a comparative example. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram for describing a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a comparative example. In the comparative example, a silicon nitride film <b>4</b> having a low adhesion strength is formed in the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. Therefore, the adhesion with the surface protection film <b>5</b> is low in the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">On the other hand, in the present embodiment, a silicon nitride film <b>4</b> which has low adhesion strength is not formed and the surface protection <b>5</b> is adhered to the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> which has a high adhesion strength in the outer peripheral section of the silicon wafer <b>1</b>. Therefore, the penetration of chemical liquid which has flowed around onto the front surface during a chemical etching process after the mechanical polishing in the wafer thickness reduction step is suppressed by the adhered section between the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> and the surface protection film <b>5</b>. Consequently, it is possible to suppress detachment of the surface protection film <b>5</b> during reverse surface processing of the semiconductor wafer. Furthermore, it is also possible to prevent penetration of the chemical liquid into the device region in the inside of the wafer. Consequently, it is possible to prevent conveyance errors or processing errors in post-processing, due to detachment of the surface protection film, or scratches on the surface of the device, or decline in the yield rate due to corrosion by the chemical liquid.</div>

In the present embodiment, a step <b>9</b> is formed on a silicon oxide film <b>2</b> in the outer peripheral section of a silicon wafer <b>1</b> and an aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is formed on the silicon oxide film <b>2</b> on which this step <b>9</b> has been formed. Consequently, a step is also formed on the surface of the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b>, and therefore the contact surface area between the surface protection film <b>5</b> and the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is increased and the adhesion is further improved.</div>

Consequently, a step is also formed in the front surface of the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b>, and therefore the contact surface area between the surface protection film <b>5</b> and the aluminum wiring layer <b>3</b> is increased and the adhesion is further improved.</div>
