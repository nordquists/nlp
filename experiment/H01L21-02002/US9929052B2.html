<heading id="h-0002">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wafer processing method for dividing a wafer into individual device chips by applying a laser beam to the wafer in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the wafer to thereby form a modified layer inside the wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A plurality of devices such as integrated circuits (ICs) and large scale integrations (LSIs) are formed on the front side of a wafer so as to be separated by a plurality of crossing division lines. The wafer thus having the plural devices is divided along the division lines into individual device chips by using a dicing apparatus or a laser processing apparatus, for example. The device chips divided from the wafer are used in electrical equipment such as mobile phones and personal computers. Further, there has been proposed a technique including the steps of applying a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to the wafer to the back side of the wafer along each division line in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the wafer to thereby form a modified layer inside the wafer along each division line, and next grinding the back side of the wafer to thereby thin the wafer and also divide the wafer into the individual device chips (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2014-007257, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2014-007257, the thickness of each device chip can be reduced and the die strength thereof can also be improved as compared with the case of using a conventional dicing apparatus to form a division start point along each division line.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present inventors have found that in performing the steps of applying a laser beam to the back side of a wafer to form a modified layer inside the wafer and next grinding the back side of the wafer to thereby thin the wafer and also divide the wafer into the individual device chips, there is a case that the wafer may be broken at a position different from each division line where the modified layer is formed. Such a breaking phenomenon causes a problem such that the devices formed on the front side of the wafer may be partially damaged to remarkably reduce the production efficiency of each device chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Under these circumstances, the present inventors have closely studied the cause of the above breaking phenomenon to obtain the following findings. After performing a modified layer forming step of applying a laser beam to the back side of a wafer in a laser processing apparatus to form a modified layer inside the wafer, the wafer is unloaded from a chuck table included in the laser processing apparatus and then transferred to a chuck table included in a grinding apparatus by using transfer means having a suction pad. In the grinding apparatus, the back side of the wafer held on the chuck table is ground to thin the wafer and divide the wafer into the individual device chips. In transferring the wafer from the chuck table of the laser processing apparatus to the chuck table of the grinding apparatus, the wafer is held by the suction pad under suction. At this time, a nonuniform internal stress is generated inside the wafer by a suction force applied to the suction pad. When this internal stress is not sufficiently relieved and the wafer is then held on the chuck table of the grinding apparatus under suction, the internal stress due to the suction holding by the suction pad is partially left inside the wafer. In the next grinding step, a grinding pressure is applied to the wafer to grind the back side of the wafer and thereby thin the wafer. Due to the application of the grinding pressure, the residual internal stress causes the breaking phenomenon at an unintentional position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a wafer processing method which can prevent the breaking phenomenon at an unintentional position in a wafer in performing the step of grinding the back side of the wafer to thin the wafer and also divide the wafer into the individual device chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a wafer processing method for dividing a wafer into a plurality of individual device chips along a plurality of crossing division lines formed on the front side of the wafer, the front side of the wafer being partitioned by the division lines to define a plurality of separate regions where a plurality of devices are formed, the individual device chips corresponding to the respective devices. The wafer processing method includes a protective tape attaching step of attaching a protective tape to the front side of the wafer; a holding step of holding the protective tape attached to the front side of the wafer on a holding surface of a first chuck table under suction; a modified layer forming step of applying a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to the wafer to the back side of the wafer along each division line in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the wafer after performing the holding step, thereby forming a modified layer inside the wafer along each division line; an unloading step of holding the back side of the wafer held on the first chuck table by using a suction pad of transfer means after performing the modified layer forming step, and next moving the suction pad to thereby unload the wafer from the first chuck table; a transfer step of transferring the wafer to a holding surface of a second chuck table by operating the transfer means after performing the unloading step, next holding the protective tape attached to the front side of the wafer on the holding surface of the second chuck table under suction, and next removing the suction pad from the back side of the wafer; and a grinding step of grinding the back side of the wafer held on the second chuck table under suction, thereby thinning the wafer and also dividing the wafer into the individual device chips. The transfer step includes a mounting step of mounting the wafer held by the suction pad to the holding surface of the second chuck table; a sandwiching step of removing a suction force applied to the suction pad after performing the mounting step, and then sandwiching the wafer between the suction pad and the holding surface of the second chuck table; and a suction holding step of applying a suction force to the holding surface of the second chuck table after performing the sandwiching step to thereby hold the protective tape attached to the front side of the wafer on the holding surface of the second chuck table under suction, and next removing the suction pad from the back side of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, in transferring the wafer from the suction pad to the second chuck table, the suction force applied to the suction pad holding the wafer under suction is removed to thereby relieve an internal stress in the wafer. Accordingly, the internal stress due to the suction holding by the suction pad is not left in the wafer and the wafer is next held on the second chuck table under suction. As a result, even when the back side of the wafer held on the second chuck table is ground to reduce the thickness of the wafer and also divide the wafer into the individual device chips in the grinding step, there is no possibility that the devices may be partially damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and an appended claim with reference to the attached drawings showing a preferred embodiment of the invention.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A specific preferred embodiment of the wafer processing method according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a silicon wafer <b>10</b> as a workpiece. The silicon wafer <b>10</b> has a front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and a back side <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. A protective tape <b>20</b> is attached to the front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b>, so as to protect the front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>(protective tape attaching step). A plurality of crossing division lines <b>14</b> are formed on the front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> to thereby define a plurality of separate regions where a plurality of devices <b>12</b> such as ICs are formed. The silicon wafer <b>10</b> originally has a thickness of 775 μm, for example, before grinding. The protective tape <b>20</b> is composed of a base sheet and an adhesive layer formed on one side of the base sheet. The base sheet has a thickness of 100 μm, and the adhesive layer has a thickness of approximately 5 μm. The base sheet is formed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and the adhesive layer is formed of acrylic resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">After performing the protective tape attaching step, a holding step is performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, there is shown a laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> (the whole configuration thereof being not shown). The laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> includes a first chuck table <b>30</b> having a holding surface <b>32</b> for holding the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> with the protective tape <b>20</b> attached to the front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>is placed on the holding surface <b>32</b> of the first chuck table <b>30</b> in the condition where the protective tape <b>20</b> is in contact with the holding surface <b>32</b> and the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>as a work surface is oriented upward. The first chuck table <b>30</b> is rotatable by a rotational drive mechanism (not shown). The holding surface <b>32</b> is formed of a porous material allowing air communication, and it is connected to suction means (not shown). In the condition shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the suction means is operated to hold the silicon wafer <b>10</b> through the protective tape <b>20</b> on the holding surface <b>32</b> of the first chuck table <b>30</b> under suction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">After performing the holding step, a modified layer forming step is performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> in such a manner that a laser beam is applied from laser beam applying means <b>40</b> included in the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> to the silicon wafer <b>10</b> along each division line <b>14</b> to thereby form a modified layer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>as a division start point inside the silicon wafer <b>10</b> along each division line <b>14</b>. More specifically, an alignment step is first performed to align a laser beam applying position with a predetermined one of the division lines <b>14</b> by using imaging means (not shown). Thereafter, the laser beam applying means <b>40</b> of the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> is operated to oscillate a laser beam having a transmission wavelength to the silicon wafer <b>10</b> from a laser oscillator (not shown) included in the laser beam applying means <b>40</b>. The laser beam oscillated is applied through focusing means <b>42</b> included in the laser beam applying means <b>40</b> to the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> held through the protective tape <b>20</b> on the first chuck table <b>30</b> in the condition where the focal point of the laser beam is set inside the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. At the same time, the first chuck table <b>30</b> is moved in the X direction shown by an arrow X in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> at a predetermined feed speed. Accordingly, a modified layer <b>10</b> <i>c </i>is formed inside the silicon wafer <b>10</b> along the predetermined division line <b>14</b>. Although not shown, the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> further includes X moving means for moving the first chuck table <b>30</b> in the X direction, Y moving means for moving the first chuck table <b>30</b> in the Y direction perpendicular to the X direction, and rotating means for rotating the first chuck table <b>30</b>. By controlling the laser beam applying means <b>40</b>, the X moving means, the Y moving means, and the rotating means, the laser processing operation mentioned above is repeated along all of the other division lines <b>14</b> to thereby form a plurality of similar modified layers <b>10</b> <i>c </i>inside the silicon wafer <b>10</b> along all of the other division lines <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the modified layer forming step using the laser beam applying means <b>40</b> is performed under the following processing conditions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">After performing the modified layer forming step, an unloading step is performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in such a manner that the silicon wafer <b>10</b> with the protective tape <b>20</b> is unloaded from the first chuck table <b>30</b>. The unloading step will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>, the unloading step is performed by using transfer means <b>50</b> (the whole configuration thereof being not shown). The transfer means <b>50</b> includes a transfer arm <b>52</b> and a suction pad <b>54</b> provided at the front end of the transfer arm <b>52</b> so as to be oriented downward. The transfer arm <b>52</b> is movable horizontally and vertically by a moving mechanism (not shown). The suction pad <b>54</b> is a disk-shaped member having substantially the same size as that of the first chuck table <b>30</b>. The suction pad <b>54</b> has a lower surface functioning as a suction holding surface <b>56</b>. The suction holding surface <b>56</b> is formed of a porous material allowing air communication, and it is connected through the transfer arm <b>52</b> to suction means (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In performing the unloading step, the transfer arm <b>52</b> is first moved by the moving mechanism to position the suction pad <b>54</b> directly above the silicon wafer <b>10</b> held on the first chuck table <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Thereafter, the moving mechanism is operated to lower the transfer arm <b>52</b> until the suction holding surface <b>56</b> of the suction pad <b>54</b> comes into abutment against the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> held on the first chuck table <b>30</b>. At this time, the distance between the suction holding surface <b>56</b> of the suction pad <b>54</b> and the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is measured by a proximity sensor (not shown). Thus, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is sandwiched between the first chuck table <b>30</b> and the suction pad <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Thereafter, the suction means connected to the suction pad <b>54</b> is operated to hold the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> under suction. Accordingly, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held under suction by both the holding surface <b>32</b> of the first chuck table <b>30</b> and the suction holding surface <b>56</b> of the suction pad <b>54</b>. Thereafter, a suction force applied to the first chuck table <b>30</b> is removed, so that the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held under suction only by the suction pad <b>54</b>. Thereafter, the transfer arm <b>52</b> is lifted to thereby move the silicon wafer <b>10</b> away from the first chuck table <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Thusly, the unloading step is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">After performing the unloading step, a transfer step is performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> in such a manner that the silicon wafer <b>10</b> with the protective tape <b>20</b> is transferred to a second chuck table <b>60</b> included in a grinding apparatus <b>6</b> (the whole configuration thereof being not shown) for grinding the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. In the transfer step, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held on the second chuck table <b>60</b> in the condition where the protective tape <b>20</b> is in contact with the upper surface of the second chuck table <b>60</b>. Thereafter, the suction pad <b>54</b> is moved away from the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. As similar to the first chuck table <b>30</b>, the upper surface of the second chuck table <b>60</b> functions as a holding surface <b>62</b> for holding the silicon wafer <b>10</b> under suction. The holding surface <b>62</b> is formed of a porous material allowing air communication, and it is connected to suction means (not shown). The grinding apparatus <b>6</b> is located adjacent to the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b>, and the transfer means <b>50</b> is so arranged as to transfer the silicon wafer <b>10</b> from the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> to the grinding apparatus <b>6</b>. The transfer step will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the moving mechanism for moving the transfer arm <b>52</b> is operated to move the transfer arm <b>52</b> and position the suction pad <b>54</b> holding the silicon wafer <b>10</b> directly above the second chuck table <b>60</b> of the grinding apparatus <b>6</b> for grinding the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. Thereafter, the moving mechanism is operated to lower the transfer arm <b>52</b> until the protective tape <b>20</b> attached to the front side <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> held by the suction pad <b>54</b> comes into abutment against the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b>. At this time, the distance between the protective tape <b>20</b> of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> and the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b> is measured by a proximity sensor (not shown). Thus, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is mounted on the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b> in the condition where the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held by the suction pad <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> (mounting step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">After performing the mounting step, a suction force applied to the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b> is removed, and a suction force applied to the suction pad <b>54</b> is also removed. The removal of the suction force applied to the suction pad <b>54</b> may be effected by physically blocking a suction passage connected to the suction pad <b>54</b> or by stopping a suction pump included in the suction means connected to the suction pad <b>54</b>. Any other methods for removing the suction force applied from the suction pad <b>54</b> to the silicon wafer <b>10</b> may be adopted. Accordingly, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is physically sandwiched between the suction pad <b>54</b> and the second chuck table <b>60</b> without receiving a suction force from the suction pad <b>54</b> and the second chuck table <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> (sandwiching step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">After performing the sandwiching step, a suction force is applied again to the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b>, thereby holding the silicon wafer <b>10</b> through the protective tape <b>20</b> on the holding surface <b>62</b> under suction. Thereafter, the transfer arm <b>52</b> is lifted to move the suction pad <b>54</b> away from the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. Thus, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held by only the second chuck table <b>60</b> under suction (suction holding step). In this manner, the mounting step, the sandwiching step, and the suction holding step are sequentially performed to thereby finish the transfer step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">After performing the transfer step, a grinding step is performed by using the grinding apparatus <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>.

The grinding means <b>70</b> includes a spindle <b>72</b> adapted to be rotated by a rotational drive mechanism (not shown), a mounter <b>74</b> fixed to the lower end of the spindle <b>72</b>, and a grinding wheel <b>76</b> mounted on the lower surface of the mounter <b>74</b>. The grinding wheel <b>76</b> is composed of a base and a plurality of abrasive members <b>78</b> fixed to the lower surface of the base so as to be arranged annularly along the outer circumference of the base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the condition where the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is held through the protective tape <b>20</b> on the second chuck table <b>60</b> under suction, the second chuck table <b>60</b> is rotated at 300 rpm, for example, in the direction shown by an arrow <b>60</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and the spindle <b>72</b> is also rotated at 3400 rpm, for example, in the direction shown by an arrow <b>72</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Thereafter, the grinding means <b>70</b> is lowered to bring the abrasive members <b>78</b> of the grinding wheel <b>76</b> into contact with the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. Further, the grinding means <b>70</b> is fed downward by a predetermined amount at a feed speed of 1 μm/second, for example, in the direction perpendicular to the holding surface <b>62</b> of the second chuck table <b>60</b>. At this time, the thickness of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> may be measured by a contact type measuring gauge (not shown) during the grinding operation. For example, the back side <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is ground until the thickness of the silicon wafer <b>10</b> becomes 60 μm. In this preferred embodiment, the modified layers <b>10</b> <i>c </i>are formed inside the silicon wafer <b>10</b> along all of the division lines <b>14</b>, so that the silicon wafer <b>10</b> can be easily broken along each division line <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is divided into individual device chips corresponding to the respective devices <b>12</b> along each division line <b>14</b> by a grinding pressure applied to the silicon wafer <b>10</b> in the grinding operation.

After performing the grinding step, the individual device chips divided from the silicon wafer <b>10</b> are transferred to an apparatus for performing a pickup step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">With the above configuration of the present invention, the following particular effects can be exhibited.

Before applying a suction force to the second chuck table <b>60</b>, the suction force applied to the suction pad <b>54</b> is removed. In this condition, no suction force is applied from the suction pad <b>54</b> and the second chuck table <b>60</b> to the silicon wafer <b>10</b>, and the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is physically sandwiched between the suction pad <b>54</b> and the second chuck table <b>60</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to once completely relieve an internal stress generated in the silicon wafer <b>10</b> due to the suction holding by the suction pad <b>54</b>. Further, since the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is physically sandwiched between the suction pad <b>54</b> and the second chuck table <b>60</b>, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> can be thereafter held on the second chuck table <b>60</b> under suction without displacement. As a result, even when the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is ground as receiving a grinding pressure in the grinding step, there is no possibility of unintentional breaking due to residual internal stress in the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the problem that the devices <b>12</b> formed on the silicon wafer <b>10</b> may be partially damaged to cause a reduction in production efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above preferred embodiment, the unloading step and the transfer step are performed by using the same suction pad <b>54</b> of the transfer means <b>50</b> to transfer the silicon wafer <b>10</b> from the first chuck table <b>30</b> of the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> to the second chuck table <b>60</b> of the grinding apparatus <b>6</b>. However, this configuration is merely illustrative and any other modifications may be made. For example, the silicon wafer <b>10</b> may be once transferred from the first chuck table <b>30</b> of the laser processing apparatus <b>4</b> to another table by using the suction pad <b>54</b> in the unloading step, and the silicon wafer <b>10</b> may be next transferred from this other table to the second chuck table <b>60</b> of the grinding apparatus <b>6</b> by using another suction pad in the transfer step. In this case, the transfer operation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> may be similarly performed in transferring the silicon wafer <b>10</b> from the other table to the second chuck table <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, while the silicon wafer <b>10</b> is used as a workpiece in this preferred embodiment, the workpiece usable in the present invention may include any wafer such that a modified layer may be formed inside the wafer along each division line and the wafer may be next thinned and divided into individual device chips by grinding. Examples of such a wafer include sapphire, silicon carbide (SiC), lithium tantalate (LT), and lithium niobate (LN) wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention is not limited to the details of the above described preferred embodiment. The scope of the invention is defined by the appended claim and all changes and modifications as fall within the equivalence of the scope of the claim are therefore to be embraced by the invention.</div>
