<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">An art disclosed herein relates to a semiconductor wafer and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor element.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-279661 discloses a semiconductor wafer including a thick region with a greater thickness than that of its central region along its outer circumferential surface. Such a semiconductor wafer is a semi-finished product produced in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element. In manufacturing of the semiconductor element, a semiconductor wafer having a uniform thickness is first prepared, and a partial structure of the semiconductor element is formed in its central region of the semiconductor wafer. Next, the central region of the semiconductor wafer is ground from one main surface side such that the semiconductor element has a desired thickness. At this occasion, in order to secure a strength of the semiconductor wafer, a region along the outer circumferential surface of the semiconductor wafer is left without being ground, and the semiconductor wafer having the above-mentioned thick region is thus manufactured. Thereafter, a remaining partial structure of the semiconductor element is formed in the central region of the semiconductor wafer, and the semiconductor wafer is diced such that individual semiconductor elements are cut out from the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the above-described semiconductor wafer, if the thickness of the semiconductor wafer is abruptly changed between the central region and the thick region, a high stress is likely to be generated at a boundary between the central region and the thick region, and the semiconductor wafer may be damaged. Regarding this point, in the semiconductor wafer described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-279661, one or more slope surfaces are provided between the central region and the thick region, and the thickness of the semiconductor wafer is made to be gradually changed between the central region and the thick region.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">According to researches by the inventors of the present teachings, it was proved that a slope surface between a central region, and a thick region can suppress chipping of a semiconductor wafer, and an effect of suppressing the chipping increases as a slope angle of the slope surface becomes small. Further, it was also proved that the slope surface between the central region and the thick region could suppress residue of chemical solution used in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element, and a higher effect could be obtained for suppressing the residue of chemical solution as the slope angle of the slope surface became smaller. However, as the slope angle of the slope surface is made smaller in order to enhance the above-mentioned effects, a width dimension of the slope surface (dimension of the slope surface in a radial direction of the semiconductor wafer) becomes wider, and an area in the central region or an area in the thick region decreases. As the area of the central region decreases, a number of semiconductor elements that can be manufactured from a single semiconductor wafer decreases. As the area of the thick-region decreases, the strength of the semiconductor wafer decreases. In the semiconductor wafer described in Japanese Patent Application. Publication No. 2009-279661, since the slope angle is constant on each of the slope surfaces, the above-mentioned trade-off problem cannot be solved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present etchings to provide a technique that can solve such a trade-off problem at least partially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">According to further research by the present inventors, the chipping of the semiconductor wafer mainly occurs at an outer circumferential portion of the slope surface. Therefore, so long as a slope angle of the outer circumferential portion of the slope surface is made small, even if a slope angle of another portion of the slope surface is made relatively large, the chipping of the semiconductor wafer can be significantly suppressed. On the other hand, the residue of chemical solution may mainly occur at an inner circumferential portion of the slope surface. Accordingly, so long as the slope angle of the inner circumferential portion of the slope surface is made small, even if the slope angle of the other portion of the slope surface is made relatively large, the residue of the chemical solution can be significantly suppressed. In this way, the slope angle of the slope surface is made inconstant such that the slope angle of at least one of the outer circumferential portion and the inner circumferential portion is made smaller than the slope angle of an intermediate portion located therebetween, and thereby the width dimension of the slope surface can be suppressed from increasing and at least one of the above-mentioned effects due to the slope surface can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The present teachings disclose a semiconductor wafer based on the above-described findings. This semiconductor wafer may comprise a central region in a planer view and a thick region extending along an outer circumferential surface of the semiconductor wafer in the planer view, the thick region being greater in thickness than the central region. One of main surfaces of the semiconductor wafer may comprise a slope surface located between the central region and the thick region. The slope surface may comprises an inner circumferential edge located on a side of central region; and an outer circumferential edge located on a side of the thick region, and the slope surface slopes such that the thickness of the semiconductor wafer increases from the inner circumferential edge to the outer circumferential edge. The slope surface may comprise an inner circumferential portion including the inner circumferential edge, an outer circumferential portion including the outer circumferential edge, and an intermediate portion located between the inner circumferential portion and the outer circumferential portion. At least one of a slope angle of the inner circumferential portion and a slope angle of the outer circumferential portion may be smaller than a slope angle of the intermediate portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The semiconductor wafer disclosed herein is a semi-finished product produced in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element. A method for manufacturing a semiconductor element may comprise: forming a partial structure of the semiconductor elements within a central portion of a semiconductor wafer in a planer view; forming a thick region that extends along an outer circumferential surface of the semiconductor wafer in the planer view by grinding the central portion from one of main surfaces of the semiconductor wafer, the thick region being greater in thickness than the central region; and forming another partial structure of the semiconductor element within the central portion of the semiconductor wafer from the one of the main surfaces of the semiconductor wafer. Further, in the forming of the thick region a slope surface having the above-described structure may further be formed between the central region and the thick region on the one of the main surfaces of the semiconductor wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">A semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> of an embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. The semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is a semi-finished product produced in a process of manufacturing a semiconductor element. Thus, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor element will be described first, and the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> will be described in detail thereafter. The semiconductor element to be manufactured is not particularly limited, however, it may include at least one of, for example, an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor), a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), or a diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is prepared. The semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is placed on a stage <b>2</b>. The semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is constituted of a semiconductor material such as silicon (Si) or silicon carbide (SiC), for example. The semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> has a disk shape, and has a first main surface <b>10</b> <i>a</i>, a second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, and an outer circumferential surface <b>10</b> <i>e</i>. The first main surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are planes parallel to each other, and each has a circular shape. The outer circumferential surface <b>10</b> <i>e </i>is a cylindrically curved surface and extends between the first main surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. At this stage, the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> has a constant thickness throughout its entirety. The semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> usually contains n-type or p-type conductive impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a partial structure of the semiconductor element is formed in a central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. In this step, for example, ion implantation of n-type or p-type conductive impurities and formation of a first electrode layer <b>12</b> to serve as a main electrode of the semiconductor element are performed mainly from a first main surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>side of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. It should be noted that specific processes performed in this step are not particularly limited, and necessary processes may be performed according to the structure of the semiconductor element. Arrows P<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically show various kinds of processes that can be performed in this step, and do not indicate any specific process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is turned over, and the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is ground from a second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>side, for example, by a grinding head <b>4</b> having a plurality of grinding stones <b>4</b> <i>a</i>. Due to this, a thickness of the central region <b>10</b> <i>e </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is adjusted to a thickness required for the semiconductor element. Here, in order to secure a strength of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>, a region along the outer circumferential surface <b>10</b> <i>e </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is left without being ground. As a result, a thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>having a thickness greater than the thickness of the central region <b>10</b> <i>e </i>is formed along the outer circumferential surface <b>10</b> <i>e </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. At this occasion, a slope surface <b>20</b> is further formed between the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>on the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. Details of the slope surface <b>20</b> will be described later. At this stage, in the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>, the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>protrudes in a frame-like manner, and a height difference is generated between the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t</i>. The slope surface <b>20</b> extends between the central region <b>10</b> <i>e </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>in a ring shape along a circumferential direction of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another partial structure of the semiconductor element is further formed in the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. In this step, for example, ion implantation of n-type or p-type conductive impurities and formation of a second electrode layer <b>14</b> to serve as another main electrode of the semiconductor element are mainly performed from the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>side of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>.

Here, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, various kinds of chemical solution <b>6</b> are used, for example, in formation of a mask through a photoresist in manufacturing of the semiconductor element. The chemical solution <b>6</b> is removed from the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> by using a centrifugal force generated by a rotation of the stage <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Finally, the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is diced such that individual semiconductor elements are cut out therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, in the process of manufacturing the semiconductor element, the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>being greater in thickness than the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>is formed along the outer circumferential surface <b>10</b> <i>e </i>on the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. By forming the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t</i>, the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> can be processed thin while securing the strength of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. However, when the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> is ground while forming the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>on the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), there is a problem that chippings are likely to occur in the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. Further, there is also a problem that, if the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>is formed on the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>, when the chemical solution <b>6</b> is used in the process of manufacturing the semiconductor element (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the chemical solution <b>6</b> is likely to remain on the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">With respect to the above problems, the slope surface <b>20</b> is formed between the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>on the second main surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the slope surface <b>20</b> has an inner circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>f </i>positioned on a central region <b>10</b> side and an outer circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>e </i>positioned on a thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>side. The slope surface <b>20</b> slopes such that the thickness of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> increases from the inner circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>f </i>toward the outer circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>e</i>. In the slope surface <b>20</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a slope angle θ is constant from the inner circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>f </i>to the outer circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>e</i>. It should be noted that a minute step <b>16</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a step generated when a surface of the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>is finished smooth and flat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">According to studies of the present inventors, it was proved that by providing the slope surface <b>20</b> between the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t</i>, the chippings of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> were suppressed and as the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> became small, the effect of suppressing the chippings was enhanced. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of experimental results by the present inventors, and shows a relationship between the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> and a number of chippings occurred. In this experiment, the slope angle θ was changed between 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees, as a result of which it was confirmed that the number of chippings decreased as the slope angle θ became small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, according to the studies conducted by the present inventors, it was also proved that by providing the slope surface <b>20</b> between the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>and the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t</i>, the residue of the chemical solution <b>6</b> was suppressed, and the effect of suppressing the residue of the chemical solution <b>6</b> was enhanced as the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> became small. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of experimental results by the present inventors and shows a relationship between the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> and the residual amount of the chemical liquid <b>6</b>. In this experiment, as a result of changing the slope angle θ between 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees, it was confirmed that the residual amount of the chemical solution <b>6</b> decreased as the slope angle θ became small. In this experiment, it was confirmed that when the slope angle θ was set to be equal to or smaller than 75 degrees, the residual amount of the chemical solution <b>6</b> became zero. It should be noted that the slope angle θ at which the residual amount of the chemical solution <b>6</b> becomes zero can change according to a type, properties, and a supplying amount of the chemical solution <b>6</b>, a rotation speed and time of the stage <b>2</b>, and/or a material and/or size of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the above-described experimental results, it is preferable that the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> is small, and thereby the above-described effects of the slope surface <b>20</b> can be enhanced. However, if the slope angle θ of the slope surface <b>20</b> is reduced to become smaller, a width dimension W of the slope surface <b>20</b> (dimension of the slope surface <b>20</b> in a radial direction of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>) becomes wide, and an area of the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>or the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>decreases. As the area of the central region <b>10</b> <i>c </i>decreases, a number of semiconductor elements that can be manufactured from one semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> decreases. As the area of the thick region <b>10</b> <i>t </i>decreases, the strength of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> weakens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The present inventors further advanced the research on the above-mentioned trade-off problem, and obtained the following findings. The chipping of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> mainly occurs at the outer circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>e </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b> and in a vicinity thereof (that is, an outer circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>a </i>including the outer circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>e</i>). Thus, by decreasing a slope angle θ<b>1</b> of the outer circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>a </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b>, even if slope angles θ<b>2</b>, θ<b>3</b> of other portions <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, <b>20</b> <i>c </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b> are made relatively large, the chipping of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> can be suppressed significantly. On the other hand, the residue of the chemical solution <b>6</b> mainly occurs at the inner circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>f </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b> and in a vicinity thereof (that is, the inner circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>b </i>including the inner circumferential edge <b>20</b> <i>f</i>). Thus, by decreasing the slope angle θ<b>2</b> of the inner circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>b </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b>, even if the slope angles θ<b>1</b>, θ<b>3</b> of the other portions <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, <b>20</b> <i>c </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b> are made relatively large, the residue of the chemical solution <b>6</b> can be suppressed significantly.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph indicating experimental data by which the effect of suppressing the chipping for the slope surface <b>20</b> according to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> was confirmed. In this experiment, the slope angle θ<b>1</b> of the outer circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>a </i>of the slope surface <b>20</b> was set to 34 degrees, the slope angles θ<b>2</b> and <b>03</b> of the inner circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>b </i>and the intermediate portion <b>20</b> <i>c </i>were set to 90 degrees. Although the slope angles θ<b>2</b> and θ<b>3</b> of the inner circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>b </i>and the intermediate portion <b>20</b> <i>c </i>are usually set to degrees smaller than 90 degrees, in this experiment the slope angles θ<b>2</b> and θ<b>3</b> of the inner circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>b </i>and the intermediate portion <b>20</b> <i>c </i>were set to 90 degrees which are most disadvantageous, in order to clarify an effect obtained in a case where only the slope angle θ<b>1</b> of the outer circumferential portion <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is made small. Samples S<b>1</b> to S<b>12</b> of twelve semiconductor wafers <b>10</b> were manufactured under the above-described conditions, and a number of chippings having a dimension of 50 micrometers or more was counted for each of the samples S<b>1</b> to S<b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it was confirmed that an average number of chippings occurred among the twelve samples S<b>1</b> to S<b>12</b> was seven, which is within an acceptable range. It should be noted that the experimental data shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an example, and a number of chippings can change, for example, depending on a material and/or dimension of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
