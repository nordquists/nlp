<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/623,540 filed Jun. 15, 2017, which is in turn a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/246,556 filed Apr. 7, 2014, which is in turn a continuation application of International Application No. PCT/JP2012/075504, filed Oct. 2, 2012, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-222782, filed on Oct. 7, 2011.

<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate and a polishing solution, and in more detail, to a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate suitable for forming a high quality semiconductor layer by epitaxial growth, and a polishing solution for obtaining the substrate.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Because silicon-carbide (SiC) semiconductor has a higher dielectric breakdown field and a larger saturated drift velocity of electron and thermal conductivity than those of a silicon semiconductor, research and development are made for realizing a power device capable of operating in higher speed at a higher temperature than those of the conventional silicon device. Above all, an attention has been attracted to the development of a high-efficient switching element used in a power source for driving a motor of a power-assisted bicycle, an electric vehicle, a hybrid car and the like. To realize such a power device, a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate having smooth surface for forming a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer by epitaxial growth is necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, a blue laser diode has attracted an attention as a light source for recording information in high density, and additionally, needs to a white diode as a light source in place of a fluorescent lamp or an electric bulb are increasing. Such a light-emitting element is prepared using a gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor, and a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate is used as a substrate for forming a high quality gallium nitride semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">High processing accuracy is required in flatness of a substrate, smoothness of a substrate surface and the like to the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate used in such use applications. Furthermore, high cleanability is required regarding a residue such as an abrasive or the like derived from a polishing agent. However, because a silicon-carbide single crystal has extremely-high hardness and excellent corrosion resistance, workability in preparing a substrate is poor, and it is difficult to obtain a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate having high smoothness while maintaining high polishing rate. Furthermore, even in the removal of the abrasive, because the silicon-carbide single crystal has excellent corrosion resistance, a method of removing an abrasive residue by lift-off using a chemical such as hydrofluoric acid as used in the cleaning of a silicon substrate is difficult to be applied. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a substrate surface having high cleanliness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, a smooth surface of a single crystal semiconductor substrate is formed by polishing. In the case of polishing silicon-carbide single crystal, the surface thereof is mechanically polished using an abrasive such as diamond or the like that is harder than silicon carbide as an abrasive material to form a smooth surface. In such a case, fine scratches according to a particle size of the diamond abrasive are incorporated in the surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate polished with the diamond abrasive. Furthermore, because an affected layer having mechanical strain is generated on the surface, the smoothness of the surface of the substrate is not sufficient as is.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In the production of a single crystal semiconductor substrate, chemical mechanical polishing (hereinafter referred to as “CMP”) technique has been used as a method for smoothening the surface of a semiconductor substrate after mechanically polishing. CMP is a method of converting the surface of a material to be processed to an oxide or the like by utilizing a chemical reaction such as oxidation and removing the oxide formed using an abrasive having hardness lower than that of the material to be processed, thereby polishing the surface. This method has the advantage that an atomic step-and-terrace structure comprising atomic steps and terraces derived from a crystal structure is formed without generating strain on the surface of a material to be process, and extremely-smooth surface in atomic level can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The formation of a silicon-carbide semiconductor layer on a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate by epitaxial growth is performed by depositing silicon atoms and carbon atoms by a thermal CVD method on an extremely-smooth surface in atomic level on which an atomic step-and-terrace structure has been formed by the CMP. In such a case, the front edge of the atomic step becomes the origin of epitaxial growth. Therefore, to obtain a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer free of crystal defect, as surface properties required in a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, not only an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from a crystal structure is formed, but high processing accuracy is required in the shape of the atomic step formed. Particularly, it is necessary in the front edge portion of the atomic step that crystal defect derived from mechanical damage by polishing is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In the present description, the “atomic step-and-terrace structure” means a micro step-like structure comprising a plurality of flat “terraces” provided so as to be parallel to each other through step difference along a principal surface of a single crystal substrate and “atomic steps” that are step difference parts connecting the terraces. A linear site at which the upper edge of the atomic step contacts the terrace is defined as a “front edge portion of an atomic step”. The “terrace”, “atomic step” and “front edge portion of an atomic step” are further described hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">To form a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer, there is a proposed method of conducting CMP by a colloidal silica slurry or a colloidal silica slurry containing an oxidizing agent after diamond polishing to form a high smoothness surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from the crystal structure, and further conducting etching by a gas-phase method (e.g., see Patent Document 1). In Patent Document 1, in the case where a silicon-carbide semiconductor layer is film-formed without conducting the etching treatment, step bunching occurs by an oxide formed extremely-near the surface of a substrate after CMP, however, by conducting the etching treatment, only a surface oxide layer generated by CMP can be removed while maintaining high smoothness of the surface of a substrate after CMP and crystal defect such as step bunching can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in Patent Document 1, although the formation of an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from the crystal structure is considered, the influence of the edge shape of an atomic step and the crystal defect, to epitaxial growth of a crystal is not considered at all. Furthermore, merely suppressing the crystal defect of a silicon-carbide semiconductor layer by etching is not sufficient to obtain a high quality semiconductor layer. Further, higher polishing rate is required to be realized from the standpoint of cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">A polishing composition containing a silica adhesive, an oxidizing agent (oxygen donor) such as hydrogen peroxide and vanadate is conventionally proposed as a polishing agent for polishing the surface of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate in high polishing rate and smoothly (e.g., see Patent Document 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the polishing composition of Patent Document 2, there was the problem that a polishing rate to a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate is low and time required for polishing is very long. There was further problem that although an atomic step-and-terrace structure is formed on the surface after polishing, the front edge portion of an atomic step becomes a shape having crack and dent due to mechanical damage at polishing and crystal defect occurs. Furthermore, there was a problem that silica abrasives that could not be removed by cleaning remain on a substrate and the abrasive residue causes crystal defect of a semiconductor layer epitaxially grown on the surface of a substrate after polishing.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and has an object to provide a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate suitable for epitaxially growing a high quality semiconductor layer free of crystal defect and a polishing solution for obtaining the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate by CMP.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate according to the present invention has a principal surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure comprising atomic steps and terraces derived from a crystal structure, wherein the atomic step-and-terrace structure has a proportion of an average line roughness of a front edge portion of the atomic step to a height of the atomic step being 20% or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate according to the present invention, the principal surface is preferably a surface on which a crystal is to be epitaxially grown to form a silicon-carbide semiconductor layer or a gallium-nitride semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The polishing solution according to the present invention is a polishing solution for chemically and mechanically polishing a principal surface of a predetermined surface direction of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, such that the principal surface has an atomic step-and-terrace structure comprising atomic steps and terraces derived from a crystal structure, and that the atomic step-and-terrace structure has a proportion of an average line roughness of a front edge portion of the atomic step to a height of the atomic step being 20% or less, in which the polishing solution comprises an oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more, and water, and does not contain an abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the polishing solution according to the present invention, the oxidizing agent is preferably permanganate ions. And the permanganate ions is contained in an amount of 0.05% by mass or more and 5% by mass or less based on the total amount of a polishing agent. Further, the polishing solution preferably has pH of 11 or less and more preferably 5 or less.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate of the present invention has an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from the crystal structure, wherein the proportion of an average line roughness (R) of a front edge portion of the atomic step to a height (h) of the atomic step is 20% or less. Because crystal defect or the like is suppressed on the front edge portion which is the origin of epitaxial crystal growth in a step flow method, by epitaxially growing on a principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer or gallium-nitride semiconductor layer can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The polishing solution of the present invention contains an oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more, and water, and does not contain an abrasive. Therefore, when a principal surface in a predetermined surface direction of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate is chemically and mechanically polished by using the polishing solution, high smoothness surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from the crystal structure and free of crystal defect in the front edge portion of the atomic step due to mechanical damage in polishing can be obtained. Furthermore, the polishing solution does not generate an abrasive residue on the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate after cleaning.</div>

<heading id="h-0011">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The embodiment of the present invention is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">&lt;Single-crystal Silicon-carbide Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate of an embodiment of the present invention has a high smoothness principal surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure in which a flat terrace <b>1</b> region and an atomic step <b>2</b> of a step difference region, which are derived from a crystal structure, are alternately continued, as schematically shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In the atomic step-and-terrace structure, a front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>at which the upper edge of the atomic step <b>2</b> contacts the terrace <b>1</b> shows a straight line state, and is free of curvature, crack and dent. The width of the terrace <b>1</b> is nearly the same in all of terraces, and is nearly uniform in each terrace. C axis shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a vertical direction to the paper face in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In the atomic step-and-terrace structure, the proportion of an average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> to a height (h) of the atomic step <b>2</b> is 20% or less. That is, (R/h)×100≤20. The R/h can be considered as an index showing the degree of mechanical damage to the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>in the atomic step-and-terrace structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The principal surface having the atomic step-and-terrace structure is a principal surface in a predetermined surface direction and is a principal surface at a predetermined off angle to the C axis. The average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is arithmetical mean roughness (Ra) of the center line of a cross-section roughness curve of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, and can be measured by, for example, the following method. That is, a predetermined range (e.g., a range of 2 μm horizontal×1 μm vertical) on a principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate is observed with AFM (atomic force microscope), the respective arithmetical mean roughnesses (Ra) of a plurality of the front edge portions <b>2</b> <i>a </i>fallen within the above range are measured from the obtained AFM image, and R is obtained as their average value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The height (h) of the atomic step is about 0.25 nm in the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, a 4H—SiC substrate has the crystal structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and is that ¼ of C0 (1.008 nm) that is a crystal lattice interval (lattice constant) in a C axis direction is the height (h) of the atomic step. That is, in the 4H—SiC substrate, the height (h) of the atomic step is a value (about 0.25 nm) calculated from 1.008 nm/4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The height (h) of the atomic step in a 6H—SiC substrate is about 0.25 nm similar to the 4H—SiC substrate. That is, in the 6H—SiC substrate, the lattice constant C0 in a C axis direction is 1.542 nm, and ⅙ of this value is the height (h) of the atomic step. Therefore, the height (h) of the atomic step is about 0.25 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The 4H—SiC substrate and 6H—SiC substrate are described in the item of an object to be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate of the embodiment, the principal surface in a predetermined surface direction has an atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from the crystal structure and has a high smoothness, and in addition, the proportion of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>to the height (h) of the atomic step <b>2</b> is 20% or less. As a result, crystal defect or the like is suppressed in the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>which is the origin of epitaxial crystal growth in a step flow method. Therefore, a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer or gallium nitride semiconductor layer can be obtained by epitaxially growing crystals on the principal surface of this single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate. The step flow method is described in detail in the item of epitaxial growth described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Where the proportion of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>to the height (h) of the atomic step <b>2</b> exceeds 20%, crystal defect and the like due to mechanical damage of the front edge portion <b>1</b> <i>a </i>in the atomic step-and-terrace structure become large, and thus a high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer or gallium-nitrile semiconductor layer cannot be formed by epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Such a principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate having excellent shape at the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and in which crystal defect at the portion is suppressed can be obtained by conducting CMP by using the polishing solution of the present invention that contains an oxidizing agent having large oxidation power and containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more and does not substantially contain an abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">&lt;Polishing Solution&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention is a polishing solution for chemically and mechanically polishing a principal surface in a predetermined surface direction of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, and the polishing solution contains an oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more and water, and does not contain an abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">By conducting CMP of a principal surface of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate by using this polishing solution, scratch to the surface and crystal defect of the front edge portion of the atomic step, due to mechanical damage in polishing can be suppressed. Then, as described before, the polished principal surface having the atomic step-and-terrace structure derived from crystal structure and in which the proportion of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion to the height (h) of the atomic step is 20% or less ((R/h)×100≤20) (hereinafter referred to as a “polished principal surface”) can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, a substrate having high hardness and high chemical stability, such as a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, can be polished in sufficiently-high polishing rate by using such an oxidizing agent having strong oxidation power in the atomic level processing. In the case where this polishing solution has been used, an abrasive does not remain on the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate after cleaning. As a result, the occurrence of crystal defect due to an abrasive residue can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As the oxidizing agent contained in the polishing solution of the embodiment of the present invention, permanganate ion is preferred, and its content is preferably 0.05% by mass or more and 5% by mass or less. The pH of the polishing solution is preferably 11 or less, and more preferably 5 or less. To adjust the pH to 11 or less, a pH adjuster can be added to the polishing solution. In the case where the pH of the polishing solution is 11 or less, the oxidizing agent acts effectively, and as a result, polishing rate is high and polishing performances are good.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Each component and pH of the polishing solution of the present invention is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">(Oxidizing Agent)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more contained in the polishing solution of the embodiment of the present invention forms an oxide layer on a face to be polished of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate that is an object to be polished. The polishing of the object to be polished is accelerated by removing the oxide layer by mechanical power from the face to be polished. That is, although the silicon carbide single crystal that is a non-oxide is a polishing-difficult material, an oxide layer can be formed on the surface by an oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more in the polishing solution. The oxide layer formed has low hardness and is easy to be polished as compared with that of the object to be polished, and thus the oxide layer can be removed by the contact with a polishing pad that does not contain an abrasive therein. Therefore, sufficiently-high polishing rate can be achieved. An oxidation-reduction potentiometer generally commercially available can be used for an oxidation-reduction potential measurement method. A silver/silver chloride electrode in which a saturated potassium chloride aqueous solution was used as an internal liquid can be used as a reference electrode, and a metal electrode such as platinum can be used as a working electrode. Regarding a temperature and pH of the aqueous solution at measuring, the measurement is performed at room temperature near 25° C., and the pH can be measured by preparing samples appropriately adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present invention, the “face to be polished” is a face of an object to be polished, which is polished, and means, for example, a surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Examples of the oxidizing agent containing a transition metal having oxidation-reduction potential of 0.5V or more and contained in the polishing solution include permanganate ion, vanadate ion, dichromate ion, cerium ammonium nitrate, iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate, silver nitrate, phosphotungstic acid, silicotungstic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, phosphotungstomolybdic acid, and phosphovanadomolybdic acid. Permanganate ion is particularly preferred. Permanganate such as potassium permanganate or sodium permanganate is preferred as a supply source of the permanganate ion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The reasons that permanganate ion is particularly preferred as the oxidizing agent in the polishing of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate are described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">(1) Permanganate ion has strong oxidation power that oxidizes silicon-carbide single crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In the case where the oxidation powder of the oxidizing agent is too weak, the reaction with a face to be polished of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate becomes insufficient, and as a result, sufficiently-smooth surface cannot be obtained. Oxidation-reduction potential is used as an index of oxidation power that an oxidizing agent oxidizes a material. Oxidation-reduction potential of permanganate ion is 1.70V, and the oxidation-reduction potential is higher than that of potassium perchlorate (KClO<sub>4</sub>) (oxidation-reduction potential: 1.20V) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) (oxidation-reduction potential: 1.63V) that are generally used as an oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">(2) Permanganate ion has large reaction rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The permanganate ion has a large reaction rate of an oxidation reaction as compared with hydrogen peroxide (oxidation-reduction potential: 1.76V) that is known as an oxidizing agent having strong oxidation power, and therefore can quickly exhibit the strength of oxidation power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">(3) Permanganate ion has low toxicity to human body and is safe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">(4) Permanganate is completely dissolved in water that is a dispersion medium described below under the condition of dissolved concentration or lower concentration that is obtained from a solubility curve and depends on water temperature. Therefore, the dissolved residue does not adversely affect smoothness of a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">To obtain a high polishing rate, the content (concentration) of the permanganate ion in the polishing solution is preferably from 0.05% by mass to 5% by mass. In the case of less than 0.05% by mass, the effect as an oxidizing agent is not expected, and there is a concern that very long time is required to form a smooth surface by polishing or scratch occurs on a face to be polished. In the case where the content of permanganate ion exceeds 5% by mass, depending on a temperature, the permanganate is not completely dissolved and precipitates, and there is a concern that scratch is generated by that solid permanganate contacts a face to be polished. The content of the permanganate ion contained in the polishing solution is more preferably 0.1% by mass or more and 4% by mass or less, and particularly preferably 0.2% by mass or more and 3.5% by mass or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">(Abrasive)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention is characterized by substantially not containing a polishing abrasive such as silicon oxide (silica) particles, cerium oxide (ceria) particles, aluminum oxide (alumina) particles, zirconium oxide (zirconia) particles, and titanium oxide (titania) particles. Because the polishing solution does not contain an abrasive and abrasive residue is not generated after cleaning as described before, the occurrence of crystal defect due to abrasive residue can be prevented. Furthermore, there are advantages that the polishing solution can be used without paying attention to dispersibility of an abrasive, and because aggregation of an abrasive does not substantially occur, mechanical damage to a face to be polished is suppressed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The object to be polished that is polished by using the polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention is a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate or a single-crystal gallium-nitride substrate that is a non-oxide single crystal, and is more preferably a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate. More specifically, a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate having crystal structure of 3C—SiC, 4H—SiC or 6H—SiC can be mentioned. The 3C—, 4H— and 6H— show crystal polymorph of silicon carbide determined by the lamination order of Si—C pair. High polishing rate can be achieved by using the polishing solution of the embodiment. Furthermore, a principal surface (polished principal surface) having the following surface properties can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In each case of using the polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention and the case of using a conventional polishing slurry containing hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent and colloidal silica abrasive, respective surface properties of the principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate obtained by CMP and the formation of a semiconductor layer by epitaxial growth onto the polished principal surface are described below by referring to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0024" num="0000">&lt;Surface Properties of Polished Principal Surface&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Mechanical damage due to diamond polishing is generated on the principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate after diamond polishing that is a pre-step of a CMP step, and not only scratch is formed on the surface, but an affected layer in which defect such as crystal strain was generated inside is formed. By conducting polishing for a considerably long period of time, even CMP by the conventional polishing slurry can remove the affected layer generated due to diamond polishing, and the polished principal surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure in which a flat terrace <b>1</b> region and an atomic step <b>2</b> of a step difference region, which are derived from a crystal structure, are alternately continued as schematically shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(<i>a</i>) and 4(<i>b</i>)</figref>, can be obtained. The C axis shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a direction vertical to the paper face in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">However, in CMP by the conventional polishing slurry described above, the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> becomes a shape having crack or dent due to mechanical damage at polishing, and crystal defect occurs. Excessive polishing of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>by an abrasive having strong mechanical action is considered as the cause of the crystal defect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">On the other hand, the polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention does not substantially contain abrasive. Therefore, in the atomic step-and-terrace structure formed on the polished principal surface, mechanical damage applied to the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step is considerably reduced. As a result, the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>free of crack, dent and crystal defect can be formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, and processing accuracy in atomic level in which smoothness is high and the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>maintains excellent shape can be achieved. Further, in the case of using the polishing solution of the embodiment, by the action of the contained oxidizing agent having strong oxidation power, an affected layer due to diamond polishing can be promptly removed in high polishing rate by only mechanical action by a polishing pad having hardness lower than that of an abrasive, even though mechanical action by an abrasive is not applied. Accordingly, high processing accuracy in atomic level in which damage to the face to be polished of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate has been suppressed is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0025" num="0000">&lt;Epitaxial Growth&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Mechanism of epitaxial growth of a semiconductor layer on a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate by a step flow method, and a role of a front edge portion of an atomic step are described on the basis of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">To epitaxially grow, for example, a silicon carbide semiconductor layer on a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, silicon atoms and carbon atoms are deposited by a thermal CVD method on the polished principal surface having formed thereon an atomic step-and-terrace structure of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate, followed by crystal growth. Each atom adhered to the terrace <b>1</b> of the atomic step-and-terrace structure reaches the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and bonds to an atom having dangling bond of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, and crystal is grown in a horizontal direction (a direction perpendicular to the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a</i>; shown by an arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) on the surface of the terrace <b>1</b>, thereby a film is formed. That is, the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> functions as the origin of crystal growth in epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">It is known that crystal quality of a semiconductor layer film-formed on a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate is strongly influenced by crystal defect and surface state of the substrate. Examples of the crystal defect of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate include micropipe defect, screw dislocation defect, and edge dislocation defect. Examples of the surface state include scratch by polishing, adhesion of contamination such as an abrasive derived from a polishing agent to the surface of the terrace <b>1</b>, and a surface oxide of the terrace <b>1</b>. Regarding the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> that is the origin of epitaxial growth, the propagation of defect present on this portion is considered. Therefore, to film-form higher quality semiconductor layer, not the polishing in which only the formation of an atomic step-and-terrace structure has been considered, but processing accuracy in atomic level in which the shape of the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> and the crystal defect have been considered is necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Considering from the above point, the polished principal surface of the single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate obtained by using the conventional slurry is that because the atomic step-and-terrace structure is formed and smoothened, crystal defect of a semiconductor layer due to scratch and the like on the surface of the terrace <b>1</b> can be suppressed, but because the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>that is the origin of crystal growth has crack, dent and the like and becomes the shape which the crystal defect is unavoidable, high quality silicon-carbide semiconductor layer or gallium-nitride semiconductor layer can not be formed thereon by epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">On the other hand, in CMP processing using the polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention, a high-smooth principal surface having an atomic step-and-terrace structure in which mechanical damage to the front edge portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the atomic step <b>2</b> has been suppressed in the atomic step-and-terrace structure can be obtained, and as a result, crystal growth of higher quality semiconductor layer becomes possible. Furthermore, because the polishing solution of an embodiment of the present invention does not contain an abrasive, an abrasive does not remain on the surface of a single-crystal silicon-carbide substrate even after cleaning, and crystal defect of a semiconductor layer due to abrasive residue derived from a polishing agent can be prevented.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As can be seen from Table 1, in the case of using the polishing solutions of Examples 1 to 4, high polishing rate is obtained to single-crystal SiC On-axis substrate, and high speed polishing was possible. Furthermore, the formation of the atomic step-and-terrace structure is confirmed from AFM image of the principal surface after polishing, and highly-smooth polished principal surface was obtained. Furthermore, in the atomic step-and-terrace structure, the proportion (A) of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion of the atomic step to the theoretical value of the height (h) of the atomic step is 20% or less, and high processing accuracy in atomic level in which mechanical damage due to polishing had been suppressed was obtained. Moreover, because the polishing solution did not contain an abrasive, high cleanliness polished principal surface free of abrasive residue was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">On the other hand, in the case of using the polishing agent solution of Example 5 containing colloidal silica as an abrasive, hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, and ammonium vanadate, the polishing rate was remarkably low value as compared with the case of using the polishing solutions of Examples 1 to 4. Furthermore, although the formation of the atomic step-and-terrace structure is confirmed from AFM image of the principal surface after polishing, the proportion of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion of the atomic step to the theoretical value of the height (h) of the atomic step is 24% which is larger as compared with Examples 1 to 4, and thus, the surface roughness is deteriorated. It was seen that crack and dent are generated in the front edge portion of the atomic step by mechanical damage due to polishing. Furthermore, abrasive residue that seems to be colloidal silica was observed on the polished principal surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Even in the case of using the polishing agent solution of Example 6 containing potassium permanganate as an oxidizing agent and further containing colloidal silica as an abrasive, the polishing rate was greatly decreased as compared with the case of using the polishing solutions of Examples 1 to 4. Furthermore, although the formation of the atomic step-and-terrace structure was confirmed from AFM image of the principal surface after polishing, the proportion of the average line roughness (R) of the front edge portion of the atomic step to the theoretical value of the height (h) of the atomic step is 28% which is larger as compared with Examples 1 to 4, and thus, the surface roughness is deteriorated. It was seen that crack and dent are generated in the front edge portion of the atomic step by mechanical damage due to polishing.
