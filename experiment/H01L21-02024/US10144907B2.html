<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing composition. More specifically, the present invention relates to a technique for removing impurities remaining on the surface of a polishing object after CMP.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">In recent years, a so-called chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technique for physically polishing and flattening a semiconductor substrate in producing a device is used in accordance with multilayer wiring on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. CMP is a method for flattening the surface of a polishing object (object to be polished) like a semiconductor substrate by using a polishing composition (slurry) containing abrasive grains such as silica, alumina, or ceria, an anti-corrosion agent, a surfactant, or the like. The polishing object (object to be polished) is silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide film, silicon nitride, a wiring or a plug which consists of metal, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">On the surface of a semiconductor substrate after CMP processing, residual impurities (defects) are present in a large amount. As for the impurities, there are abrasive grains, metals, an anti-corrosion agent and an organic material such as a surfactant that are derived from a polishing composition used for CMP, a silicon-containing material or a metal which is generated according to polishing of a silicon-containing material, metal wirings or plug as a polishing object, and also an organic material such as pad debris which is generated from various pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">Once the surface of a semiconductor substrate is contaminated with those impurities, an adverse effect may be exhibited on electrical properties of a semiconductor, and thus there is a possibility of having lower device reliability. In addition, if contamination by organic materials is significant, breakage of a device may be caused. Thus, it is necessary to remove those impurities from the surface of a semiconductor substrate by introducing a cleaning step after CMP step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">For a cleaning step, a cleaning agent is used to remove those impurities from the surface of a semiconductor substrate, and various kinds of cleaning agent have been developed so far (see, Patent Literature 1)</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">However, there is a problem that, since impurities are not sufficiently removed even by the above cleaning step, the impurities still remain on the surface of a polishing object like a semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a means to sufficiently remove impurities remaining on the surface of a polishing object after CMP.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">To solve the above problem, the inventors of the present invention conducted intensive studies. As a result, it was found that the cleaning effect by a cleaning step at later stage can be significantly improved when a polishing object is polished by using a novel polishing composition after CMP, and the present invention is completed accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010">Namely, the polishing composition of the present invention is used after polishing is performed by using a polishing composition (A) containing abrasive grains or an organic compound (A), and the polishing composition is characterized by containing an organic compound (B) which contains at least one atom selected from the group consisting of a fluorine atom, an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, and a chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 100 or more, a pH adjusting agent, and 0 to 1% by mass of abrasive grains.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Effect of the Invention</heading>

<heading id="h-0009">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Hereinbelow, the embodiments of the present invention are described. However, the present invention is not limited to the following embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Polishing Composition&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">A polishing composition according to an embodiment of the present invention is a polishing composition which is used after polishing is performed by using a polishing composition (A) including abrasive grains or an organic compound (A), including an organic compound (B) which has a molecular weight of 100 or more and includes at least one atom selected from the group consisting of a fluorine atom, an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, and a chlorine atom, a pH adjusting agent, and 0 to 1% by mass of abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0014">Meanwhile, in the present specification, the polishing composition according to the present invention is referred to as a “polishing composition (B)” in order to distinguish it from the polishing composition (A). Furthermore, “polishing using the polishing composition (A)” and “polishing using the polishing composition (B)” are also referred to as “polishing (A)” and “polishing (B)”, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0015">As described above, the surface of a polishing object after CMP (polishing (A)) is contaminated with abrasive grains, metals, an anti-corrosion agent or an organic material such as a surfactant derived from the polishing composition (the polishing composition (A)) which has been used for CMP, a silicon-containing material or a metal which is generated according to polishing of a silicon-containing material, metal wirings or plug as a polishing object, and also organic materials such as pad debris which is generated from various pads. When the polishing composition (B) of the present invention is used for polishing of a polishing object adhered with such impurities, the cleaning effect of a cleaning step at later stage is significantly improved so that the impurities can be sufficiently removed from the surface of a polishing object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0016">Although the detailed mechanism for having the effect exhibited by the polishing composition (B) of this embodiment remains unclear, by the inventors of the present invention, it is believed to be related with the following mechanism. However, the present invention is not limited to the mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0017">In the polishing (A), abrasive grains or an organic compound derived from the polishing composition (A), impurities that are generated according to polishing of a polishing object, pad debris, or the like are adhered to the surface of a polishing object. It is believed that adhesion of those impurities occurs based on the electric charges present on a surface of impurities and a surface of a polishing object or the hydrophobic interactions between them. The organic compound (B) contained in the polishing composition (B) of the present invention is characterized in that it contains at least one atom selected from the group consisting of a fluorine atom, an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, and a chlorine atom. In this regard, due to the presence of those atoms having high electronegativity, polarization occurs within the molecule, and thus the organic compound (B) is partially hydrophilized. Meanwhile, by having molecular weight of 100 or more, the organic compound (B) also have a hydrophobic part. For such reasons, if polishing is performed by using the polishing composition (B), impurities are replaced with the organic compound (B) or the impurities are floated by being surrounded by the compound based on hydrophobic interaction, and thus the impurities can be easily removed from the surface of a polishing object. Furthermore, since part of the molecule of the organic compound (B) is hydrophilic as described above, the wettability on the surface of a polishing object is improved, and according to cleaning with water or the like at later stage, the organic compound (B) itself can be easily removed. Hereinbelow, each constitutional component of the polishing composition (B) of this embodiment is described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0018">[Organic Compound (B)]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0019">The organic compound (B) has an activity of facilitating the removal of impurities, which remain on the surface of a polishing object by CMP, in a cleaning step at later stage. The organic compound (B) is characterized in that it contains at least one atom selected from the group consisting of a fluorine atom, an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, and a chlorine atom. By having those atoms having high electronegativity, polarization occurs within the molecule and thus the organic compound (B) can have partially hydrophilicity. As a result, not only the impurities can be easily removed but also the wettability on the surface of a polishing object can be improved. In particular, from the viewpoint of having easier polarization, it is preferable that the organic compound (B) has at least one atom selected from the group consisting of a fluorine atom, an oxygen atom, and a nitrogen atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0020">Furthermore, examples of the functional group included in the organic compound (B) (functional group containing an oxygen atom and/or a nitrogen atom) include a hydroxyl group, an amino group, and the like, although it is not particularly limited thereto. Among them, from the viewpoint of having improved wettability, the organic compound (B) preferably has a hydroxyl group. Furthermore, for a case in which a hydroxyl group is contained, it is preferable that the organic compound (B) has 3 or more hydroxyl groups in one molecule. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of preventing re-adhesion, it is preferable that the organic compound (B) has one or more amino groups. Furthermore, for a case in which it contains an amino group, the organic compound (B) may have a cyclic amine structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0021">Specific examples of the organic compound (B) include, as an organic compound having a hydroxyl group, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyglycerin, and polyoxyethylene polyglyceryl ether. Specific examples of the organic compound having an amino group include polyoxyethylene alkylamine and polyoxyethylene fatty acid amide ether. Specific examples of the organic compound having a cyclic amine structure include polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Specific examples of the organic compound having a fluorine atom include fluorinated alkyl-substituted glycol and partially fluorinated alcohol-substituted glycol. Specific examples of the organic compound having a chlorine atom include chlorinated alkyl-substituted glycol and partially chlorinated alcohol-substituted glycol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0022">As for the organic compound (B), either a product synthesized by a known method or a commercially available product can be used. In particular, from the viewpoint of having the effect of removal impurities or easy obtainability, it is preferably hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyoxyethylene (6) polyglyceryl ether, polyoxyethylene lauric acid amide ether, polyoxyethylene stearylamine, partially fluorinated alcohol-substituted glycol, or the like. Meanwhile, the organic compound (B) may be used either singly or in combination of two or more types.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0023">Molecular weight (weight average molecular weight) of the organic compound (B) is essentially 100 or more, preferably from 100 to 100,000, more preferably from 300 to 80,000, and still more preferably from 500 to 50,000. If the molecular weight (weight average molecular weight) is less than 100, it is impossible to have a hydrophobic part and the effect of removing impurities is not exhibited at sufficient level. Thus, having the molecular weight of 100 or more is an essential requirement. Meanwhile, if the molecular weight (weight average molecular weight) is 100,000 or less, it can be dispersed in water. Incidentally, in the present specification, a value measured by GPC-MALS method is employed as the weight average molecular weight. For the case of water soluble polymer having relatively low molecular weight, the weight average molecular weight can be measured by an NMR method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0024">Content of the organic compound (B) is, although not particularly limited, preferably 0.0001 to 1% by mass, more preferably 0.0005 to 0.8% by mass, and still more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by mass relative to the total weight of the polishing composition. If the content of the organic compound (B) is 0.0001% by mass or more, impurities on the surface of a polishing object (in particular, organic materials) can be sufficiently removed. On the other hand, if the content is 1% by mass or less, it is possible to inhibit the organic compound (B) remaining on the surface of a polishing object after the polishing (B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0025">[pH Adjusting Agent]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0026">The polishing composition of this embodiment essentially contains a pH adjusting agent. Accordingly, the polishing composition can be adjusted to a desired pH range. Meanwhile, pH of the polishing composition is, although not particularly limited, preferably 1 to 13, more preferably 1.5 to 12.5, and still more preferably 2 to 12. If pH is 2 or more, easy handleability is obtained. On the other hand, if pH is 12 or less, dissolution of abrasive grains can be inhibited in the case of containing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0027">As for the pH adjusting agent, an acid or an alkali used as a pH adjusting agent in corresponding technical field can be suitably employed. As for the acid or alkali, any one of an inorganic compound and an organic compound is acceptable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0028">Examples of the acid include inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, carbonic acid, hypophosphorous acid, phosphorous acid, and phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as carboxylic acids including formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, n-hexanoic acid, 3,3-dimethylbutyric acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid, 4-methylpentanoic acid, n-heptanoic acid, 2-methylhexanoic acid, n-octanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, benzoic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, glyceric acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, maleic acid, phthalic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and lactic acid, and organic sulfuric acids including methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, and isethionic acid. Examples of the alkali include hydroxides of an alkali metal, such as potassium hydroxide; amines such as ammonia water, ethylene diamine, and piperazine; and quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethyl ammonium and tetraethyl ammonium. These acids or alkalis can be used either singly or in combination of two or more types.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0029">Content of the acid or alkali in the polishing composition is not particularly limited as long as it is an amount allowing the polishing composition within the aforementioned pH range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0030">[Dispersion Medium or Solvent]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0031">The polishing composition of the present embodiment preferably contains water as a dispersion medium or a solvent for dispersing or dissolving each component. More preferably, the solvent is water. Water containing impurities at as low amount as possible is preferable from the viewpoint of suppressing the inhibition of the activity of other components. Specifically, pure water or ultra-pure water obtained by removing foreign matters through a filter after impurity ions are removed using an ion exchange resin, or distilled water is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0032">[Abrasive Grains]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0033">The polishing composition of the present embodiment may further contain abrasive grains, if necessary. However, to further enhance the effect of the present invention, concentration of the organic materials having molecular weight of 100 or more other than the organic compound (B) preferably has low concentration, and it is preferable that the materials are substantially not contained in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0034">In particular, it is preferable that the polishing composition of the present embodiment substantially does not contain abrasive grains. Meanwhile, the abrasive grains are the same as the abrasive grains that are contained in the polishing composition (A) described below, and detailed descriptions will be given for the polishing composition (A). Specifically, content of the abrasive grains is, relative to the total amount of the polishing composition, essentially 1% by mass or less, preferably 0.8% by mass or less, and more preferably 0.5% by mass or less. When the content of the abrasive grains is more than 1% by mass, there is a possibility that the abrasive grains remain on the surface of a polishing object even after a cleaning step which is performed later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0035">The method for producing the polishing composition (B) of the present embodiment is not particularly limited, and it can be obtained by mixing and stirring each component described above in water. The temperature for mixing each component is, although not particularly limited, preferably 10 to 40° C. Heating may be performed to increase the dissolution rate. The mixing time is not particularly limited, either.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0036">[Polishing Composition (A)]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0037">The polishing composition (A) contains at least one of abrasive grains and the organic compound (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0038">The abrasive grains have an activity of polishing mechanically a polishing object, and they improve polishing rate of a polishing object by a polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0039">The abrasive grains may be any one of inorganic particles, organic particles, and organic and inorganic composite particle. Examples of the inorganic particles include particles composed of metal oxide such as silica, alumina, ceria, or titania, silicon nitride particles, silicon carbide particles, and boron nitride particles. Specific examples of the organic particles include methyl polymethacrylate (PMMA). In particular, from the viewpoint of easy obtainability and cost, silica is preferable. Colloidal silica is more preferable. Meanwhile, the abrasive grains may be used either singly or in combination of two or more types. Furthermore, a commercially available product or a synthesized product may be used as abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0040">The abrasive grains may be surface-modified. General colloidal silica has a zeta potential value of nearly zero under acidic conditions, and therefore tends to cause agglomeration without electrical repulsion between silica particles under the acidic conditions. In contrast, abrasive grains which have been surface-modified so as to have a relatively large negative zeta potential value even under acidic conditions, are strongly repelled with each other and are well dispersed even under acidic conditions. As a result, the storage stability of the polishing composition is improved. Such surface-modified abrasive grains can be obtained by mixing a metal such as aluminum, titanium, or zirconium, or an oxide thereof with abrasive grains and doping the resulting mixture onto a surface of the abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0041">Among those abrasive grains, colloidal silica obtained by immobilizing an organic acid on a surface (colloidal silica modified with organic acid) is particularly preferable. An organic acid is immobilized to a surface of colloidal silica contained in the polishing composition, for example, by chemically bonding a functional group of the organic acid to the surface of the colloidal silica. Only by making the colloidal silica and the organic acid coexist, the organic acid is not immobilized to the colloidal silica. For example, sulfonic acid which is a kind of an organic acid can be immobilized to colloidal silica by a method described in “Sulfonic acid-functionalized silica through quantitative oxidation of thiol groups”, Chem. Commun. 246-247 (2003). Specifically, colloidal silica of which surface is immobilized with sulfonic acid can be obtained by coupling a silane coupling agent having a thiol group such as 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane to colloidal silica and then oxidizing the thiol group with hydrogen peroxide. Alternatively, carboxylic acid can be immobilized to colloidal silica by a method described in “Novel Silane Coupling Agents Containing a Photolabile 2-Nitrobenzyl Ester for Introduction of a Carboxy Group on the Surface of Silica Gel”, Chemistry Letters, 3, 228-229 (2000). Specifically, colloidal silica of which surface is immobilized with carboxylic acid can be obtained by coupling a silane coupling agent containing a photoreactive 2-nitrobenzyl ester to colloidal silica and then irradiating the resulting product with light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0042">The lower limit of an average primary particle diameter of the abrasive grain is preferably 5 nm or more, more preferably 7 nm or more, and still more preferably 10 nm or more. Furthermore, the upper limit of the average primary particle diameter of the abrasive grain is preferably 500 nm or less, more preferably 100 nm or less, and still more preferably 70 nm or less. Within such a range, the polishing rate of the polishing object by the polishing composition is improved, and it is possible to further suppress an occurrence of dishing on the surface of the polishing object after the polishing object is polished using the polishing composition. Meanwhile, the average primary particle diameter of the abrasive grain is calculated, for example, based on a specific surface area of the abrasive grain which is measured by a BET method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0043">For a case in which the polishing composition (A) contains abrasive grains, the lower limit of the content of the abrasive grains is preferably 0.005% by mass or more, more preferably 0.5% by mass or more, still more preferably 1% by mass or more, and particularly preferably 3% by mass or more. Furthermore, the upper limit of the content of the abrasive grains is preferably 50% by mass or less, more preferably 30% by mass or less, and still more preferably 15% by mass or less. Within such a range, the polishing rate of the polishing object by the polishing composition is improved, cost related to the polishing composition (A) can be saved, and it is possible to further suppress an occurrence of dishing on the surface of the polishing object after the polishing object is polished by using the polishing composition (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0044">The organic compound (A) is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include an agent which is added to suppress the polishing rate or etching rate, and specific examples thereof include a metal corrosion inhibitor for metal and dihydric alcohol for silicon-containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0045">The metal corrosion inhibitor is not particularly limited, but is preferably a heterocyclic compound or a surfactant. The number of members of the heterocyclic ring in the heterocyclic compound is not particularly limited. Furthermore, the heterocyclic compound may be a monocyclic compound or a polycyclic compound having a condensed ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0046">Specific examples of the heterocyclic compound which can be used as a metal corrosion inhibitor include nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds such as a pyrrole compound, a pyrazole compound, an imidazole compound, a triazole compound, a tetrazole compound, a pyridine compound, a pyrazine compound, a pyridazine compound, a pyrindine compound, an indolizine compound, an indole compound, an isoindole compound, an indazole compound, a purine compound, a quinolizine compound, a quinoline compound, an isoquinoline compound, a naphthyridine compound, a phthalazine compound, a quinoxaline compound, a quinazoline compound, a cinnoline compound, a pteridin compound, a thiazole compound, an isothiazole compound, an oxazole compound, an isoxazole compound, and a furazan compound.</div>

Furthermore, according to another embodiment, a method for producing a substrate including a step for polishing a polishing object by the polishing method is provided. Hereinbelow, descriptions are given for the polishing method and method for producing a substrate of the present embodiment. Meanwhile, the polishing object in this embodiment is a polishing object which is obtained after the polishing (A) using the aforementioned polishing composition (A), and it is preferably a polishing object after the polishing (A) but before the cleaning step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0069">[Polishing Step]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0070">The polishing object of the present embodiment is not particularly limited, but it is preferably a substrate which includes a metal, a material of Group IV, or a silicon material. By polishing the polishing object, a substrate can be produced. Examples of the metal include Cu, W, Al, Ta, and TiN.

Furthermore, examples of the silicon material include silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide, and silicon oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0071">Among them, from the viewpoint of obtaining even higher effect of the present invention, the polishing object is preferably a hydrophobic material. In the present specification, the hydrophobic material indicates a material showing “contact angle” of more than 40° when “contact angle” is obtained, before polishing, by using θ/2 method after taking a photo of a water droplet which has been dropped on a surface of a material by using a wafer cleanness and treatment analyzer CA-X200 manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd. Examples of the hydrophobic material include materials other than oxide, and metals such as Cu, W, Al, Ta, and TiN and silicon materials such as polysilicon and silicon nitride can be mentioned. Among them, silicon, polysilicon, and silicon nitride are preferable from the viewpoint of strictly reducing the remaining organic materials or abrasive grains.</div>

Specifically, a pad with pad hardness of 60 or less, and preferably 50 or less is preferable. By using such soft pad, flaws (scratches) caused by polishing can be reduced. Meanwhile, in the present specification, the pad hardness means Shore D hardness of a polishing pad.</div>

For example, the rotation number of a polishing platen and rotation number of a head are preferably from 10 to 500 rpm, and the pressure (polishing pressure) applied to a substrate having a polishing object is preferably from 0.5 to 10 psi. A method for supplying a polishing composition to a polishing pad is not particularly limited, either. For example, a method in which a polishing composition is supplied continuously using a pump or the like can be employed (discarded after single use). The supply amount is not limited, but a surface of the polishing pad is preferably covered all the time with the polishing composition of the present invention, and it is from 10 to 10,000 ml/minute. The polishing time is not particularly limited, either. However, for the step of using the polishing composition (B), it is preferably from 5 to 60 seconds.
