<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Fine polishing is performed using polishing liquid to the surface of materials, such as metal, metalloid, non-metal and their oxides. For instance, the surface of silicon wafers used as components of semiconductor products is commonly subjected to a lapping step (rough polishing step) and a polishing step (fine polishing step) to have a high-quality mirror surface. The polishing step typically includes a preliminary polishing step and a final polishing step. Prior art documents relating to polishing compositions mainly used for polishing of a semiconductor substrate such as a silicon wafer include Patent Literatures 1 to 3. Patent Literature 4 relates to polishing liquid for CMP process.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently a more improved polishing removal rate has been requested for semiconductor substrates such as a silicon wafer and other substrates in terms of the productivity or the like. For instance, the polishing removal rate may be improved at any polishing step (preliminary polishing step) upstream of the final polishing step in the polishing step, whereby productivity of the substrates can be improved. In the preliminary polishing step, a polishing composition may be used repeatedly (recycled-use) in recycle. Therefore a polishing composition capable of keeping a good polishing removal rate stably in such a usage mode as well, if any, will effectively contribute to the improvement of productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the circumstances, the present invention aims to provide a polishing composition capable of keeping a good polishing removal rate stably.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a polishing composition, including silica particles as abrasives and a basic compound as polishing removal accelerator. The silica particles have a density of silanol groups that is 1.5 to 6.0 pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>. The polishing composition has an adsorption ratio parameter A that is 1.2 or less, the adsorption ratio parameter representing concentration dependency of an amount of adsorption of the basic compound to the silica particles as a ratio of high-concentration adsorption amount/low-concentration adsorption amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">A smaller adsorption ratio parameter A means that the amount of a basic compound adsorbed to silica particles is less affected by the amount (concentration) of the basic compound included in the polishing composition. For instance, this means that even when the amount of a basic compound included in the polishing composition decreases, the amount of the basic compound to silica particles hardly decreases. Therefore a polishing composition having a small adsorption ratio parameter A is hardly lowered in polishing removal rate even when the concentration of the basic compound decreases during use. A polishing composition including silica particles having a density of silanol group within the above range and including a basic compound having a small value of the adsorption ratio parameter A about the silica particles can keep a good polishing removal rate stably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">A polishing composition according to one preferable embodiment includes, as polishing removal accelerator, a basic compound having the adsorption ratio parameter A that is 1.1 or less. Such a polishing composition can exert a better effect of suppressing a decrease in polishing removal rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In a polishing composition according to another preferable embodiment, a density of silanol groups of the silica particles is 1.5 to 4.0 pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>. A polishing composition including such silica particles as abrasives can exert a higher polishing removal rate stably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The technique disclosed here can be preferably embodied in the embodiment in which the basic compound includes one type or two types or more of compounds selected from the group consisting of the following general formula (A) and general formula (B):</div>

A polishing composition including such a basic compound can exert a good polishing removal rate stably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">A polishing composition according to one preferable embodiment includes at least a compound represented by the above general formula (A) as the basic compound. A polishing composition having excellent ability of keeping a polishing removal rate can be configured favorably using the compound represented by the above general formula (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferable examples of a compound represented by the above general formula (A) include a compound (aminoalkylpiperazine) having at least one aminoalkyl group bonded to any one of nitrogen atoms in a piperazine cycle, such as N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine and 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In one preferable embodiment of the technique disclosed here, the polishing composition does not include oxidant substantially. When the polishing composition includes oxidant, when such a composition is supplied to an object to be polished, the surface of the object to be polished is oxidized to form an oxide film, which may degrade the polishing removal rate. The polishing composition that does not include oxidant substantially used can avoid such a decrease in polishing removal rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In one preferable embodiment of the technique disclosed here, the silica particles include colloidal silica.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In one preferable embodiment of the technique disclosed here, the polishing composition as stated above is used for polishing of a silicon wafer (typically a silicon single-crystal wafer).

Of them, this is particularly preferably used for preliminary polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">A preferable embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Matters not specifically mentioned in the description but required for embodying the present invention can be understood as matters of design variation of a person skilled in the art based on related art in the field. The present invention can be embodied on the basis of the contents disclosed in the description and common general knowledge in the field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">&lt;Abrasives&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A polishing composition disclosed here includes silica particles as abrasives. For instance, when the technique disclosed here is used for a polishing composition that can be used for polishing of a silicon wafer, such a polishing composition includes silica particles as abrasives particularly preferably. The reason is as follows. That is, when an object to be polished is a silicon wafer, since silica particles as abrasives used include the same elements as those of the object to be polished and oxygen atoms, residues such as metal or metalloid that are different from silicon will not be generated after polishing. Therefore this can avoid the deterioration of electrical properties of silicon wafer, resulting from contamination at the surface of the silicon wafer or diffusion of metal or metalloid that is different from silicon into the object to be polished. Further since silicon and silica have similar degree of hardness, excessive damage will not be given to the surface of silicon wafers during polishing. From such a viewpoint, a polishing composition including silica particles only as abrasives is exemplified as one form of the preferable polishing composition. In addition, silica has such characteristics that highly pure silica is easily available. This is another reason why silica particles are preferable as the abrasives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As the silica particles, those having a density of silanol group of 1.5 to 6.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>are preferably used. This is described below. In the CMP method using abrasives and polishing removal accelerator, the abrasives contribute to the polishing of an object to be polished mainly from its mechanical action, while the polishing removal accelerator contributes to the polishing of an object to be polished mainly from its chemical action. It can be considered that, rather than that the abrasives and the polishing removal accelerator exert their polishing abilities independently, their mechanical action and chemical action are mutually related to achieve effective polishing. In such a CMP method, the present inventors focused on the position of polishing removal accelerator relative to abrasives in polishing liquid (relative relationship in arrangement). Specifically a basic compound used as polishing removal accelerator can have adsorptive property to the surface of silica particles as abrasives in the polishing liquid. It can be considered that such polishing removal accelerator adsorbed or adjacent to the surface of abrasives follow the abrasives and can reach the surface of an object to be polished more effectively. Various studies on abrasives based on this finding revealed that abrasives having a density of silanol group within a predetermined range can lead to good exertion of both of the chemical action by polishing removal accelerator and the mechanical polishing action by abrasives to realize effective polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">A “density of silanol group” here refers to the number of silanol groups per the surface area of silica particles of 1 nm<sup>2</sup>, which can be calculated from the specific surface area of silica particles measured by a BET method, BET specific surface area, and the amount of silanol groups measured by titration. Specifically, a density of silanol groups can be measured in accordance with a method for measuring a density of silanol groups described in the below-described examples. As silica particles in the technique disclosed here, commercially available silica particles having a desired density of silanol groups can be used, or silica particles having a desired density of silanol groups can be synthesized by a well-known technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As a density of silanol groups of silica particles increases, the amount of a basic compound adsorbed to the silica particles typically increases. Silica particles with more basic compound as polishing removal accelerator adsorbed thereto can be brought to the surface of the object to be polished together with the basic compound, whereby such silica particles can exert good polishing action. From such a viewpoint, a density of silanol groups of silica particles is preferably 1.5 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or more, more preferably 1.8 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or more and further preferably 2.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or more. When a too large density of silanol groups may lead to deterioration of polishing action of such silica particles. Such a too large density of silanol groups may lead to easy deterioration of the ability of keeping the polishing removal rate. Therefore appropriate density of silanol groups is 6.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or less, preferably 4.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or less, more preferably 3.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or less, and further preferably 2.5 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Specific examples of silica particles include colloidal silica, fumed silica, and precipitated silica. From the viewpoint that scratches are unlikely to be generated on the surface of an object to be polished and a surface having a lower haze can be achieved, preferred examples of the silica particles include colloidal silica and fumed silica. Of them, colloidal silica is preferred. For instance, colloidal silica can be preferably adopted as the abrasives in a polishing composition used for polishing (at least one of preliminary polishing and final polishing, preferably preliminary polishing) of silicon wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The shape of silica particles disclosed here is not limited especially, and the silica particles may have a spherical form or a non-spherical form. Specific examples of the shape of non-spherical silica particles include a peanut-like shape (or a peanut shell-like shape), a cocoon-like shape, and a shape with protrusions. One type of silica particles having the same shape may be used alone, or two types or more of silica particles having different shapes may be combined for use. For example, silica particles in which many of the particles have a peanut-like shape can be preferably adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Silica making up silica particles typically has a density of 1.5 or more. The density is usually 1.6 or more appropriately, preferably 1.7 or more, more preferably 1.8 or more, further preferably 1.9 or more, and particularly preferably 2.0 or more. An increase in density of silica can lead to the improvement in polishing removal rate when polishing an object to be polished (e.g., a silicon wafer). From the viewpoint of reducing scratches generated on the surface (polished face) of an object to be polished, silica particles having such a density of 2.3 or less, e.g., silica particles having a density of 2.2 or less, are preferable. As the density of abrasives (typically silica), a measurement determined by a liquid displacement method using ethanol as the displacement liquid can be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">A polishing composition disclosed here may include abrasives other than silica particles within the range of not greatly degrading the advantageous effect of the present invention. Such abrasives other than silica particles (hereinafter they may be called “optional abrasives”) may be inorganic particles other than silica, organic particles, or organic/inorganic composite particles. Specific examples of the inorganic particles include oxide particles such as alumina particles, cerium oxide particles, chromium oxide particles, titanium dioxide particles, zirconium oxide particles, magnesium oxide particles, manganese dioxide particles, zinc oxide particles, and colcothar particles; nitride particles such as silicon nitride particles and boron nitride particles; carbide particles such as silicon carbide particles and boron carbide particles; diamond particles; and carbonates such as calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. Specific examples of the organic particles include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particles, poly(meth)acrylic acid particles (here, the (meth)acrylic acid inclusively means acrylic acid and methacrylic acid), and polyacrylonitrile particles. Such optional abrasive types may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The content of optional abrasives is appropriately 30% by weight or less, for example, of the total weight of abrasives included in the polishing composition, preferably 20% by weight or less, and more preferably 10% by weight or less. The technique disclosed here is preferably embodied when the content of optional abrasives is 5% by weight or less of the total weight of abrasives included in the polishing composition. The polishing composition may not include optional abrasives substantially. The polishing composition not including optional abrasives substantially means that no optional abrasives are blended at least intentionally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the technique disclosed here, the abrasives included in the polishing composition may be in the form of primary particles or in the form of secondary particles formed by assembly of a plurality of primary particles. Abrasives in the form of primary particles may be mixed with abrasives in the form of secondary particles. In a preferred embodiment, at least some of the abrasives are contained in the form of secondary particles in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The average primary particle size of the abrasives is not limited especially, but is preferably 5 nm or more, more preferably 10 nm or more, and particularly preferably 20 nm or more from the viewpoint of polishing removal rate, for example. From the viewpoint of achieving higher polishing effect, the average primary particle size is preferably 25 nm or more and more preferably 30 nm or more. Abrasives having the average primary particle size of 40 nm or more may be used. From the viewpoint of the storage stability (e.g., the dispersion stability), the average primary particle size of the abrasives is preferably 100 nm or less, more preferably 80 nm or less, further preferably 70 nm or less, and 60 nm or less, for example. In the technique disclosed here, the average primary particle size of abrasives can be, for example, calculated in accordance with the equation of D=2727/S (nm) using the specific surface area (m<sup>2</sup>/g) measured by the BET method. The specific surface area can be measured by using a surface area analyzer, trade name “Flow Sorb II 2300” manufactured by Micromeritics, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The average secondary particle size (secondary particle size) of abrasives is not limited especially, but is preferably 10 nm or more, more preferably 15 nm or more, further preferably 20 nm or more, and particularly preferably nm or more. From the viewpoint of achieving higher polishing effect, the average secondary particle size is particularly preferably 40 nm or more (e.g., 50 nm or more, typically 60 nm or more). From the viewpoint of the storage stability (e.g., the dispersion stability), the average secondary particle size of the abrasives is appropriately 200 nm or less, preferably 150 nm or less, and more preferably 100 nm or less (e.g., 80 nm or less). The average secondary particle size of abrasives can be, for example, measured by dynamic light scattering using model “UPA-UT151” manufactured by NIKKISO CO., LTD., for example. The same applies to other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The average ratio of major axis length/minor axis length (average aspect ratio) of the abrasives is not limited especially, but it is preferably 1.01 or more and more preferably 1.05 or more (e.g., 1.1 or more). An increase in average aspect ratio of the abrasives leads to a higher polishing removal rate. The average aspect ratio of the abrasives is preferably 3.0 or less, more preferably 2.0 or less, and further preferably 1.5 or less from the viewpoint of the polishing removal rate and less scratches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The shape (outer shape) and the average aspect ratio of the abrasives can be understood by observation under an electron microscope, for example. Specific procedures for understanding the average aspect ratio are as follows. For example, a predetermined number (for example, 200 pieces) of abrasives that can be identified to have independent particle shapes are observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a rectangle is circumscribed around each grain image so as to have a minimum area. The long side length (major axis length) of the rectangle circumscribing each grain image is divided by the short side length (minor axis length), and the calculated value is considered as the major axis length/minor axis length ratio (aspect ratio). The arithmetic mean of the aspect ratios of the predetermined number of grains is calculated to give the average aspect ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">&lt;Polishing Removal Accelerator&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">A polishing composition disclosed here includes a basic compound as a polishing removal accelerator in addition to silica particles having a density of silanol groups as stated above. A polishing removal accelerator functions to polish an object to be polished chemically, and is a component that contributes to the improvement in polishing removal rate. A basic compound used as the polishing removal accelerator can increase pH of the polishing composition, and can improve the dispersion state of the abrasives. This can improve the dispersion stability of the polishing composition, and can improve the mechanical polishing action of the abrasives. The basic compound may be an organic basic compound such as cyclic amines or quaternary ammonium compounds or an inorganic basic compound. For the basic compound, those listed below may be used singly or in combination of two types or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">For the polishing removal accelerator in the technique disclosed here, a basic compound having an adsorption ratio parameter A of 1.2 or less is preferably used, and the adsorption ratio parameter represents the density dependency of the amount of adsorption to silica particles. This is described below. A smaller adsorption ratio parameter A (closer to 1) means that the amount of a basic compound adsorbed to silica particles included in a polishing composition is less affected by the amount (concentration) of the basic compound included in the polishing composition. For instance, even when the basic compound in the polishing composition is consumed by reaction with an object to be polished, for example, during the use of the polishing composition, the amount of the basic compound adsorbed to silica particles hardly decreases. Therefore a polishing composition having a small adsorption ratio parameter A is hardly lowered in polishing removal rate even when the concentration of the basic compound decreases during use. Suppression of lowering in polishing removal rate during the use of the polishing composition can lead to improvement of the polishing efficiency in the polishing step as a whole, and to improvement in productivity. A polishing composition with less lowering in performance (e.g., lowering in polishing removal rate) during the use in recycle is preferable also from the viewpoint of reducing environmental load or material cost because of the reduced amount of waste liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">This “adsorption ratio parameter A” is determined as follows: two types of dispersion liquid (a<sub>2</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>) are prepared, one of which includes 10% by weight of silica particles of the same type as that included in the polishing composition and 0.1 mol/L of the basic compound of the same type as that included in the polishing composition, the other of which includes 10% by weight of the silica particles and 0.2 mol/L of the basic compound. Then each dispersion liquid is diluted with water by a factor of 15, and the amounts of adsorption of the basic compound to the silica particles, low-concentration adsorption amount (a<sub>A</sub>) and high-concentration adsorption amount (b<sub>A</sub>), are found. Then, the “adsorption ratio parameter A” is calculated by the following expression using these adsorption amounts: A-b<sub>A</sub>/a<sub>A</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The adsorption amounts (a<sub>A</sub>) and (b<sub>A</sub>) of the basic compound to the silica particles can be found by subtracting the amount of the basic compound in the water phase of the dispersion liquid, free basic compound, from the overall amount of the basic compound included in each of the two types of dispersion liquid. The amount of the basic compound in the water phase can be measured by a well-known appropriate method using total organic carbon (TOC), titration, or the like. A sample for measurement can be prepared by performing pretreatment such as concentration tuning or pH tuning, as needed, to supernatant liquid obtained from the dispersion liquid through centrifugal separation. From the viewpoint of measurement accuracy, dispersion liquid as aqueous solution (a<sub>1</sub>) and (b<sub>1</sub>) prepared similarly to the dispersion liquid (a<sub>2</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>) other than that they does not include silica particles is preferably used as reference as in the method for measurement of the adsorption ratio parameter A described in the below-described examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Specifically, the adsorption ratio parameter A can be measured in accordance with a method for measuring the adsorption ratio parameter A described in the below-described examples. In this method for measuring the adsorption ratio parameter A, the amount of the basic compound in the water phase is found by a method based on TOC measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As stated above, the adsorption ratio parameter A is calculated as the ratio of high-concentration adsorption amount (b<sub>A</sub>) to the low-concentration adsorption amount (a<sub>A</sub>). Typically as the concentration of a basic compound increases, the amount of silica particles adsorbed to the basic compound tends to increase. Therefore, the adsorption ratio parameter A is, but not limited especially, about 0.95 or more usually, and 1.00 or more typically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The adsorption ratio parameter A is preferably 1.20 or less. From the viewpoint of the ability of keeping a better polishing removal rate, the adsorption ratio parameter is more preferably 1.10 or less, and further preferably 1.05 or less. In one preferable embodiment, a basic compound having the adsorption ratio parameter A in the range of 0.95 to 1.05 (e.g., 1.00 to 1.02) is used.</div>

Therefore, when a polishing composition inevitably includes a small amount of oxidant (e.g., the mol concentration of oxidant in the polishing composition is 0.0005 mol/L or less, preferably 0.0001 mol/L or less, more preferably 0.00001 mol/L or less, and particularly preferably 0.000001 mol/L or less) resulting from the raw materials or manufacturing method, such a polishing composition is covered by the concept mentioned here of the polishing composition that does not include oxidant substantially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">&lt;Polishing Liquid&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The polishing composition disclosed here typically is supplied to an object to be polished in the form of polishing liquid including the polishing composition for polishing of the object to be polished. The polishing liquid can be prepared by diluting any one of the polishing compositions disclosed here (typically diluted with water), for example. Alternatively, the polishing composition may be used as the polishing liquid without any treatment. In other words, the concept of the polishing composition in the technique disclosed here covers both of polishing liquid that is supplied to an object to be polished for polishing the target (working slurry) and concentrated liquid that is diluted and is used as polishing liquid (a stock solution of a polishing liquid). Other examples of the polishing liquid containing the polishing composition disclosed here include polishing liquid prepared by adjusting the pH of the composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The content of abrasives in the polishing liquid disclosed here is not limited especially, but the content is typically 0.05% by weight or more, preferably 0.1% by weight or more, and more preferably 0.3% by weight or more (e.g., 0.5% by weight or more). An increase in the content of abrasives leads to a higher polishing removal rate. From the viewpoint of the dispersion stability of the polishing composition, for example, appropriate content of abrasives is 10% by weight or less, preferably 7% by weight or less, more preferably 5% by weight or less, and further preferably 3% by weight or less. The technique disclosed here is preferably used for the polishing liquid having such content of 2% by weight or less, and 1% by weight or less as well, from which the effect of keeping a good polishing removal rate stably can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The polishing liquid preferably has a pH of 8.0 or more (e.g., 8.5 or more), more preferably 9.0 or more, and further preferably 9.5 or more (e.g., 10.0 or more). A larger pH of the polishing liquid leads to an increase in polishing removal rate. The upper limit of the pH of the polishing liquid is not limited especially, but the upper limit is preferably 12.0 or less (e.g., 11.5 or less) and more preferably 11.0 or less. This enables better polishing of an object to be polished. Such a pH can be preferably used for the polishing liquid used for polishing of silicon wafers. The pH of the polishing liquid can be found as follows: a pH meter (for example, a glass electrode-type hydrogen ion concentration indicator (model: F-23) manufactured by Horiba, Ltd.) and standard buffer solutions (a phthalate pH buffer solution with a pH of 4.01 (25° C.), a neutral phosphate pH buffer solution with a pH of 6.86 (25° C.), and a carbonate pH buffer solution with a pH of 10.01 (25° C.)) are used to perform three-point calibration. Then a glass electrode is then immersed in polishing liquid, and after 2 minutes or longer, a stabilized value is measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">&lt;Concentrated Liquid&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The polishing composition disclosed here may be in a concentrated form (that is, the form of a concentrated liquid of the polishing liquid) before supplied to an object to be polished. The polishing composition in such a concentrated liquid form has advantages from the viewpoint of the convenience at the time of production, distribution, storage, and the like and cost reduction, for example. The concentration rate can be, for example, about 2 to 100 and usually is about 5 to 50 in terms of volume appropriately. The concentration rate of a polishing composition according to a preferred embodiment is 10 to 40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The polishing composition in such a concentrated liquid form can be used in such a way that the polishing composition is diluted at an appropriate timing to give a polishing liquid, and the polishing liquid is supplied to an object to be polished. The dilution can be typically performed by adding the above-mentioned aqueous solvent to the concentrated liquid and mixing it. When the aqueous solvent is a mixed solvent, some of the components in the aqueous solvent may be added for dilution, or a mixed solvent containing these components at a ratio different from that of the aqueous solvent may be added for dilution. For a multi-pack type polishing composition as described later, some of the packed components may be diluted, and then the other packed components may be mixed to prepare polishing liquid. Alternatively, a plurality of packed components may be mixed, and then the mixture may be diluted to prepare polishing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The content of abrasives in such concentrated liquid may be 50% by weight or less, for example. From the viewpoint of stability of the polishing composition (for example, dispersion stability of abrasives), filterability and the like, the content of the abrasives in the concentrated liquid is commonly, preferably 45% by weight or less and more preferably 40% by weight or less. From the viewpoint of the convenience at the time of production, distribution, storage, and the like, cost reduction, and the like, the content of the abrasives in the concentrated liquid can be, for example, 0.5% by weight or more and is preferably 1% by weight or more and more preferably 3% by weight or more (for example, 4% by weight or more). In one preferable embodiment, the content of abrasives may be 5% by weight or more, or may be 10% by weight or more (e.g., 15% by weight or more, further 20% by weight or more, further 30% by weight or more).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The polishing composition disclosed here may be a one-pack type or a multi-pack type including a two-pack type. For example, the polishing composition can be composed in such a manner that liquid A containing some of the components of the polishing composition (typically a component other than the aqueous solvent) and liquid B containing the remaining components may be mixed, and the mixture is used for polishing an object to be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">&lt;Preparation of Polishing Composition&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The method for manufacturing the polishing composition disclosed here is not limited especially. For example, a well-known mixer such as a blade-type stirrer, an ultrasonic disperser, and a homomixer may be used to mix components contained in the polishing composition. The manner of mixing these components is not limited to especially. For example, all of the components may be concurrently mixed, or the components may be mixed in an appropriate order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">&lt;Applications&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The polishing composition disclosed here can be used for polishing of an object to be polished made of various materials and having various shapes. For instance, the object to be polished may be made of metals such as silicon, aluminum, nickel, tungsten, copper, tantalum, titanium, stainless-steel, and germanium, metalloids, or alloys of them; glass-based substances such as quartz glass, alminosilicate glass, and glasslike carbon; ceramic materials such as alumina, silica, sapphire, silicon nitride, tantalum nitride, and titanium nitride; composite semiconductor substrate materials such as silicon carbide, gallium nitride, and gallium arsenide; and resin materials such as polyimide resins. The object to be polished may be made of a plurality of materials of them. Of them, an object to be polished having a surface made of silicon (e.g., silicon materials such as silicon single-crystal wafer) is preferable for polishing. The technique disclosed here can be particularly preferably used for a polishing composition that includes silica particles only as abrasives and is used for polishing of silicon materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The object to be polished may have any shape. The polishing composition disclosed here can be preferably used for polishing of an object to be polished having, for example, a plate-like shape or a polyhedron shape with a flat surface or for polishing an edge of an object to be polished (for example, polishing a wafer edge).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">&lt;Polishing&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The polishing composition disclosed here is used for a polishing composition for polishing of silicon materials such as a silicon substrate (e.g., single-crystal or poly-crystal silicon wafer, especially silicon single-crystal wafer). The following describes one preferable embodiment of the method for polishing an object to be polished using the polishing composition disclosed here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">That is, polishing liquid including any one of the polishing compositions disclosed here is prepared. The preparing of polishing liquid can include preparing polishing liquid by subjecting a polishing composition to concentration adjustment (for example, dilution), pH adjustment, or other operations. Alternatively, the polishing composition may be used as the polishing liquid without any treatment. For a multi-pack type polishing composition, the preparing of polishing liquid can include mixing packed components, diluting one or a plurality of packed components before the mixing, and diluting the mixture after the mixing, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Next, the polishing liquid is supplied to an object to be polished, and the target is polished in usual ways. For example, when a silicon substrate is subjected to primary polishing (typically, double-side polishing), a silicon substrate that has been subjected to a lapping step is set to a common polishing apparatus, and the polishing liquid is supplied to a surface to be polished of the silicon substrate through a polishing pad on the polishing apparatus. Typically, while the polishing liquid is continuously supplied, the polishing pad is pressed against the surface of the silicon substrate, and the polishing pad and the silicon substrate are relatively moved (for example, rotationally moved). Subsequently, the silicon substrate is subjected to secondary polishing as needed (typically single-side polishing), and finally is subjected to final polishing, whereby polishing of the object to be polished ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The polishing composition disclosed here can be preferably used for polishing using a polishing pad. The polishing pad used in the polishing step may be any polishing pad. For example, any polishing pad of a nonwoven fabric type, a suede type, a polyurethane type, including abrasives, and not including abrasives can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The polishing composition disclosed here can be used in the embodiment in which the polishing composition once used is discarded (so-called “one-way”), or may be repeatedly used in recycle. One example of the method for using the polishing composition in recycle includes collecting the polishing composition after use that is discharged from the polisher into a tank, and feeding the collected polishing composition to the polisher again. When the polishing composition is used in recycle, the amount of the polishing composition after use that is dealt with as wasted liquid can be reduced as compared with the case of one-way, and so environmental load can be reduced. Since the usage of the polishing composition is reduced, the cost can be reduced. The polishing composition disclosed here is less affected in amount of adsorption of the basic compound to abrasives by alkali concentration, and therefore a good polishing removal rate can be kept stably in such a usage form in recycle as well. Therefore, the importance of the configuration of the present invention can be exerted well in such a usage form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">When the polishing composition disclosed here is used in recycle, new components, components that are reduced during use or components that are desirably increased can be added to the polishing composition during use at any timing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">According to the description, a method for manufacturing a substrate is provided, which includes the step of polishing a substrate using the polishing composition disclosed here. The method for manufacturing a substrate disclosed here may further include a step of performing final polishing to the substrate subjected to the polishing using the polishing composition as stated above. The final polishing means the last polishing step in a production process of target products (in other words, the step after which no further polishing is performed). The final polishing may be performed using the polishing composition disclosed here or using another polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In one preferable embodiment, the step of polishing the substrate using the polishing composition as stated above is a polishing step upstream of the final polishing. Of them, this step can be used preferably for preliminary polishing of the substrate subjected to lapping. For instance, the polishing composition disclosed here can be preferably used in the double-side polishing (typically primary polishing step using a double-side polisher) of a substrate subjected to lapping, or in the first single-side polishing of a substrate subjected to the double-side polishing (typically a first secondary polishing step). In these double-side polishing step and the first single-side polishing step, a larger polishing removal rate is required than in the final polishing. Therefore, the polishing composition disclosed here is preferable for the polishing composition used for polishing of a substrate in at least one of the double-side polishing and the first single-side polishing (preferably both of them). For instance, the polishing composition is preferable for the polishing composition used in the double-side polishing of a substrate subjected to lapping and in the embodiment of use in recycle. The method for manufacturing a substrate as stated above can be preferably performed in the embodiment including, after preliminary polishing of a substrate using the polishing composition disclosed here, final polishing of the substrate using another polishing composition.</div>

This was used as a sample for titration. Such a sample for titration was titrated in the range of pH from 4.0 to 9.0 using aqueous sodium hydroxide of 0.1 mol/L in concentration, and silanol group density [pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>] was calculated from the amount of titration at this time and the value of BET specific surface area of the silica particles as stated above.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The polishing compositions according to these examples were used as the polishing liquid without any treatment, and polishing test was performed to a silicon wafer. Then the polishing removal rate of silicon was evaluated. For a test piece, a silicon wafer of 300 mm in diameter (conductive type: P type, crystal orientation: &lt;100&gt;, resistivity: not less than 0.1 Ω·cm and less than 100 Ω·cm) was prepared so that the surface roughness was 0.5 nm to 1.5 nm by a double-side polisher.

After the polishing for 10 minutes, the pad was dressed using a brush for 1 minute while letting pure water flowing over so as to remove the composition left on the pad after the polishing. This was performed continuously for 10 batches. Then, the polishing removal rate [μm/min.] was calculated for each of the first batch and the tenth batch by the following calculating expressions (1) and (2):
<br/>
Polishing removal[cm]=difference in weight of the silicon wafer before and after polishing[g]/density of silicon[g/cm<sup>3</sup>](=2.33 g/cm<sup>3</sup>)/area to be polished[cm<sup>2</sup>](=36 cm<sup>2</sup>); and  (1)

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">As illustrated in Table 1, Examples 1 to 9, using the polishing liquid having the silanol group density of the silica particles that was 1.5 to 6.0 pieces/nm<sup>2 </sup>and having the adsorption ratio parameter A of the basic compounds that was 1.2 or less, had apparently better ability of keeping the polishing removal rate than in Comparative Examples 3 and 4, using the polishing liquid having the adsorption ratio parameter A exceeding 1.2. Examples 1 to 6, using the polishing liquid of the silanol group density of 1.5 to 4.0 pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>, had especially good ability of keeping the polishing removal rate. On the contrary, Comparative Example 2, using the polishing liquid of the silanol group density that was larger than 6.0 pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>, had low ability of keeping the polishing removal rate, and the initial polishing removal rate (first batch) also was low. Comparative Example 1, using the polishing liquid of the silanol group density that was smaller than 1.5 pieces/nm<sup>2</sup>, also had low initial polishing removal rate. According to the polishing liquid of Examples 1 to 9, their initial polishing removal rate was high and the polishing removal rate ratio also was large. Therefore, they successfully kept a good polishing removal rate stably, and so polished substrates effectively. Since the effect was obtained even when the types of basic compound as the polishing removal accelerator was changed, the polishing compositions satisfying the silanol group density and the adsorption ratio parameter A as stated above presumably are effective for various types of basic compounds. From these results, AEP and BAPP are especially preferable for the polishing removal accelerator, and of them, AEP is preferable.</div>
