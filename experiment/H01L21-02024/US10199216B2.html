<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">To date, transistors used in power electronic applications have typically been fabricated with silicon (Si) semiconductor materials. Common transistor devices for power applications include Si CoolMOS®, Si Power MOSFETs, and Si Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). More recently, silicon carbide (SiC) power devices have been considered. Group III-N semiconductor devices, such as gallium nitride (GaN) devices, are now emerging as attractive candidates to carry large currents, support high voltages and to provide very low on-resistance and fast switching times.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top”, “bottom”, “front”, “back”, “leading”, “trailing”, etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the figure(s) being described. Because components of the embodiments can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, thereof, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A number of exemplary embodiments will be explained below. In this case, identical structural features are identified by identical or similar reference symbols in the figures. In the context of the present description, “lateral” or “lateral direction” should be understood to mean a direction or extent that runs generally parallel to the lateral extent of a semiconductor material or semiconductor carrier. The lateral direction thus extends generally parallel to these surfaces or sides. In contrast thereto, the term “vertical” or “vertical direction” is understood to mean a direction that runs generally perpendicular to these surfaces or sides and thus to the lateral direction. The vertical direction therefore runs in the thickness direction of the semiconductor material or semiconductor carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">As employed in this specification, when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being “on” or extending “onto” another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” or extending “directly onto” another element, there are no intervening elements present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">As employed in this specification, when an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly connected” or “directly coupled” to another element, there are no intervening elements present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">A depletion-mode device, such as a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor, has a negative threshold voltage which means that it can conduct current at zero gate voltage. These devices are normally on. An enhancement-mode device, such as a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor, has a positive threshold voltage which means that it cannot conduct current at zero gate voltage and is normally off. An enhancement-mode device is not limited to low voltages and may also be a high-voltage device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, a “high-voltage device”, such as a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor, is an electronic device which is optimized for high-voltage switching applications. That is, when the transistor is off, it is capable of blocking high voltages, such as about 300 V or higher, about 600 V or higher, or about 1200 V or higher, and when the transistor is on, it has a sufficiently low on-resistance (RON) for the application in which it is used, i.e., it experiences sufficiently low conduction loss when a substantial current passes through the device. A high-voltage device can at least be capable of blocking a voltage equal to the high-voltage supply or the maximum voltage in the circuit for which it is used. A high-voltage device may be capable of blocking 300 V, 600 V, 1200 V, or other suitable blocking voltage required by the application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, a “low-voltage device”, such as a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor, is an electronic device which is capable of blocking low voltages, such as between 0 V and V<sub>low</sub>, but is not capable of blocking voltages higher than V<sub>low</sub>. V<sub>low </sub>may be about 10 V, about 20 V, about 30 V, about 40 V, or between about 5 V and 50 V, such as between about 10 V and 30 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein the phrase “Group III” element refers to one of the elements of Group III of the periodic table of elements including aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga) and indium (In).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the phrase “Group III-Nitride” refers to a compound semiconductor that includes nitrogen (N) and at least one Group III element, including aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and boron (B), and including but not limited to any of its alloys, such as aluminum gallium nitride (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N), indium gallium nitride (In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-y)</sub>N), aluminum indium gallium nitride (Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>N), gallium arsenide phosphide nitride (GaAs<sub>a</sub>P<sub>b</sub>N<sub>(1-a-b)</sub>), and aluminum indium gallium arsenide phosphide nitride (Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>As<sub>a</sub>PbN<sub>(1-a-b)</sub>) , for example. Aluminum gallium nitride and AlGaN refers to an alloy described by the formula Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x)</sub>N, where 0&lt;x&lt;1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a wafer <b>20</b> including a substrate <b>21</b> having an upper surface <b>22</b>, a side face <b>23</b> and a rear surface <b>24</b>. The wafer <b>20</b> further includes a plurality epitaxial Group III nitride layers <b>25</b> arranged on the upper surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>. A peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface substrate, the side face <b>23</b> and the rear surface <b>24</b> of the substrate form an edge region <b>30</b> which is uncovered by the plurality of epitaxial Group III nitride layers <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The substrate <b>21</b> has an upper surface <b>22</b>, which is capable of supporting the epitaxial growth of Group III nitride material in at least an active area <b>27</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>. The active area <b>27</b> is bounded by the peripheral region <b>26</b>. The border between the active area <b>27</b> and peripheral region <b>16</b> is indicated with the dashed line <b>31</b>. The substrate <b>21</b> may include a single crystal wafer, such as a single crystal silicon wafer, which in at least in the active area <b>27</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>, has a surface having a &lt;111&gt; orientation. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>21</b> may also include a single crystal silicon carbide wafer, or a sapphire wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In the peripheral region <b>26</b>, the orientation of the surface of the substrate <b>21</b> may differ from the ideal orientation, for example, a &lt;111&gt; orientation in the case of a silicon single crystal wafer <b>21</b>. This difference may arise from the presence of an upper bevel <b>28</b> which extends at an inclined angle between the upper surface <b>22</b> and the side face <b>23</b> of the wafer <b>21</b>. The edge region <b>30</b> may also include a second lower bevel <b>29</b> between the side face <b>23</b> and the rear surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The cross-sectional form of the edge region <b>30</b> of the substrate, in particular, the form of the upper bevel <b>28</b> and the lower bevel <b>29</b> may be selected to ease automatic handling of the substrate <b>21</b> during production, by avoiding sharp edges which may be prone to damage. The edge region <b>30</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> may, in a cross-sectional view, have different forms including a trapezoidal form or rounded form or a combination of trapezoidal bevels and a rounded side face <b>23</b>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The substrate <b>21</b> is typically substantially circular and may include a flat to indicate the physical orientation of the substrate <b>21</b>. The active area <b>27</b> may be substantially circular and the peripheral region <b>26</b> may be substantially ring-shaped and border the active area <b>27</b> on all sides. The finish of the upper surface <b>22</b> may be different to the finish of the rear surface <b>24</b>. For example, the surface roughness of the polished upper surface <b>22</b> may be less than the surface roughness of the rear surface <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The edge region <b>30</b> and the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b> of the wafer <b>21</b> has a width d which may lie in the range of 1 mm to 1 cm. The width w of the wafer <b>21</b> may lie in the range of 150 mm to 300 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">One or more Group III nitride layers <b>25</b> are grown on the upper surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> by one or more of various deposition techniques, including Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) or Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD). In the active area <b>25</b>, the one of more Group III nitride layers have a monocrystalline structure and an epitaxial relationship with the upper surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>. One of more of the elements of the Group III nitride layers <b>25</b> may be deposited onto the edge region <b>30</b>, in particular, onto the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>, upper bevel <b>28</b> and side face <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The material including the Group III element, which is deposited in the edge region <b>30</b>, may include non-epitaxially deposited Group III nitride. For example, the region of the Group III nitride layers <b>25</b> arranged in the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> may have poorer epitaxy compared to those regions of the Group III nitride layers <b>25</b> arranged in the active area <b>23</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b> may include a surface which is incapable of supporting the epitaxial growth of Group III nitride material. If material including Group III nitride is deposited in the peripheral region <b>26</b>, it may nucleate and grow in a non-epitaxial fashion. A polycrystalline group III nitride layer or particles including a Group III nitride material may be formed in the edge region <b>30</b>. This polycrystalline Group III nitride material may have a poorer adhesion to the substrate <b>21</b> than the epitaxially deposited material in the active area <b>27</b>. This polycrystalline Group III nitride material may have an increased tendency to be removed from the edge region <b>30</b> during handling of the wafer <b>20</b>. Consequently, it may be desirable to remove the lower quality material from the edge region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Since wafers such as the wafer <b>20</b> are typically handled by physical contact at the edge regions <b>30</b> only of the wafer <b>20</b>, possible contamination of the handling equipment by material present in the edge region <b>30</b> may occur. This possibility of contamination may be avoided by preventing physical contact between the edge region <b>30</b> and the handling equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">One or more of the elements of the epitaxial group III nitride layer present in the edge region <b>30</b> may provide a possible source of contamination in the production line if this element or elements comes into contact with the wafer handling equipment. In particular, a Group III element, such as gallium, aluminium or indium may, if it is removed from the substrate <b>21</b> and remains within apparatus of the production equipment, provide a source of contamination for a subsequently processed wafer which may negatively influence the properties of devices subsequently processed in the production line, for example silicon-based devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>, the side face <b>23</b> and the rear surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> are formed by the material of the substrate <b>21</b>. In these embodiments, the edge region <b>30</b> or a portion of the edge region <b>30</b> may be treated to remove any material, for example material including a Group III element, from the edge region <b>30</b> so that the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>, side face <b>23</b> and rear surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> are formed by the material of the substrate <b>21</b>. In the case of a &lt;111&gt; silicon single crystal wafer substrate, the peripheral region <b>26</b> of the upper surface <b>22</b>, side face <b>23</b> and rear surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>21</b> are formed by the material of the substrate <b>21</b> are formed by silicon. The edge region may be free of a Group III element or may include less than a threshold concentration of a Group III element, such as less than 1e<sup>11 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The Group III nitride material is, therefore, arranged only in the active area <b>27</b> in which the Group III nitride layers have an epitaxial relationship with the orientation of the substrate <b>21</b>. Contact between handling equipment and the wafer <b>20</b> is restricted to the edge region <b>30</b> such that the handling equipment comes into physical contact with the material of the substrate <b>21</b> only and physical contact between the handling equipment and the active area <b>27</b> on the upper surface <b>22</b> including the plurality of epitaxial Group III nitride layers in the active area <b>27</b> is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A possible source of contamination by a Group III nitride element of the wafer <b>20</b>, such as material including a Group III nitride material, may be removed in a number of ways from the edge region <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the edge region <b>30</b> may be treated to remove any material positioned in the edge region <b>30</b> such that the edge region <b>30</b> is formed by the material of the substrate <b>21</b>. In other embodiments, a source of contamination can be removed by providing an additional physical barrier on the edge region <b>30</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">A possible source of contamination by a Group III element in an edge region of a wafer may be removed by removing any material including a Group III element or covering the edge region, at least in portions of the edge region which may come into physical contact with processing apparatus, with a protective coating having a composition without any Group III elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The wafer according to any one of the embodiments may be an intermediate product. For example, the wafer may include a single Group III nitride layer, but typically includes a stack of Group III nitride layers epitaxially grown on the upper surface of a substrate. The edge region is cleaned or protected to remove any possible source of contamination by a Group III nitride element before the wafer is further processed. The wafer may then be further processed to produce semiconductor devices including the stack of Group III nitride layers such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) or transistor devices such as High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). These subsequent processes may include the deposition of metal layers to form a metallization structure and/or electrodes/and/or contact pads.</div>

The metallization structure <b>182</b> may include one or more layers with intervening dielectric layers such that each device position within the wafer is provided with a source pad <b>183</b>, a gate pad <b>184</b> and a drain pad <b>185</b> in each device position <b>186</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The individual High Electron Mobility Transistor devices <b>187</b> are then singulated from the wafer, for example by sawing, to provide individual components. Two component positions <b>186</b> and two High Electron Mobility transistor devices <b>187</b> are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, in practice, hundreds or thousands of devices may be fabricated on a single substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">A heterojunction <b>188</b> is formed at the interface between the first Group III nitride layer <b>178</b> and second Group III nitride layer <b>179</b> which supports the formation of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) by induced and spontaneous polarization. The two dimensional electron gas is indicated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by dashed line <b>189</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Epitaxially grown GaN on Si (<b>111</b>) wafers for HEMTs tend to have a full coverage of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>x-1</sub>N material on the wafer edge, the upper and lower bevel, and the side wall or face of the wafer. Due to the loss of the (<b>111</b>) direction at these areas the nucleation occurs in a random fashion which may produce closed layers, large crystallites and also partially empty areas. Furthermore, the backside of GaN/Si wafers may have areas including Ga which may result from insufficient cleaning of the wafer carrier during growth of the stack of Group III nitride layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">These defects could cause defects during further processing of such wafers and also Ga contamination in CMOS lines. Gallium acts as a p-type doping with very fast diffusion through silicon oxides starting from temperatures around 700° C. The highest risk of contamination during processing may stem from the edge due to handling, position, and transporting of wafers in boxes. Hence the removal of such layers is may be performed for both GaN production and Si and GaN co-production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">These imperfectly grown III-N layers may be removed down to the silicon substrate using various methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The typical dimensions of the material region to be removed from the edge of the wafer are in the range of the epitaxial layer, for example 2-6 μm. These layers may be fully removed from the wafer edge, the side wall, and the upper and lower bevel, and the wafer backside by chemical etching or mechanical grinding. In addition the wafer may be covered with a dielectric layer in order to prevent direct contact with the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Mechanical removal of the wafer edge, the side wall, and the upper and lower bevel, and the wafer backside can be achieved by different grinding and cleaning methods including edge cutting by laser, back side grinding, front side (edge) grinding, or grinding of the whole edge using band-type grinder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Wet chemical etching is a further simple and cheap method which may be used to remove the unwanted III-N layers and particles. The active wafer area may be masked. Before placing a mask, the whole wafer may be ex-situ or in-situ passivated in order to prevent any modification of the surface structure. Masking may use standard photo-resist which may be removed around the edge either by standard resist removal or preferably by edge and flat/notch exposure. Depending on the etching solvent and temperature, an additional hard mask could be used below the resist. An example is a silicon oxide hard mask used to remove the III-N stack including a SiN passivation layer by hot phosphoric acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Alternatively, the wet etching process could be assisted by dry etching. This may be helpful as the good crystal quality of the upper portions of the III-N layer on the top side of the wafer (but at the wafer edge) can strongly reduce the etch rate of hot phosphoric acid on the c-plane of GaN. Dry etching could be used to assist removal of the upper layers until the low quality nucleation region is reached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In another embodiment, selective growth of the epitaxial Group III nitride layered structure in wafer center and removal of a peripheral mask by lift-off may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Using an amorphous layer on the Si (<b>111</b>) substrate at the edge region, nucleation of III-N layers can be prevented. This however requires a sufficiently large mobility range for the chemical reactants during the epitaxial deposition process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The fabrication of such peripheral masking layers can be done either by using an mechanical shadow ring during a dry etch process, which etches only the active area of the wafer and prevents ion bombardment from the rest of it, or by using an local oxidation process after a hard mask. The so produced oxide ring could be used directly as a selective growth mask or to define underlying layers by wet chemical etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, coverage of the non-active area can be used in order to prevent direct contact to remaining Ga contamination and defects. This may be used if, for example Group III—nitride layers produce defects and cracks in the silicon substrate which allow Ga to remain even after cleaning procedures. Therefore, the covering method can be implemented before or after any mentioned removal method. A covering layer using a 50 nm SiN layer and an 800 nm TEOS layer may be used to reduce the amount of Ga contamination by a factor of 100. The stack could also include poly-silicon in order to slow down Ga diffusion from the inside to the covering surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Combinations of the above mentioned methods may be helpful in improving the effectiveness and simplicity of removing the GaN layer from the wafer edge, bevels, and side wall of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Using the method of selective re-growth leads to a well-defined low quality deposition of III-N crystallites on the wafer edge, which can be removed much faster as the etch does not depend on the crystal quality any more. In addition, the good etch selectivity of the c-plane compared to other planes allows also a selective removal of any edge particles or regions without etching the active area III-N stack.</div>
