<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Heretofore, precision polishing has been performed using a polishing liquid on surfaces of materials such as metals, metalloids, non-metals and their oxides. For instance, the surface of a silicon wafer used as a component of a semiconductor product, etc., is generally polished to a high quality mirror finish via a lapping step (rough polishing step) and a polishing step (precision polishing step). The polishing step typically comprises a first polishing step and a final polishing step. Patent Documents 1 and 2 are cited as technical literatures related to polishing compositions used primarily for polishing semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers, etc.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Many polishing compositions for polishing (especially precision polishing) of semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers and other substrates include water-soluble polymers for protecting surfaces of polishing objects and for increasing their wettability, etc. An example of such water-soluble polymer is hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). HEC is a polymer derived from a natural compound (cellulose). Thus, the level of control is limited for its chemical structure and purity as compared to polymers (or synthetic polymers, hereinafter) obtained by artificially polymerizing monomers. On the other hand, synthetic polymers are advantageous in that as compared to naturally-derived polymers such as HEC, their structural control is relatively easy including adjustment of their weight average molecular weights and molecular weight distribution (ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn)), allowing a great degree of reduction of foreign substances and local disorder (micro-scale aggregation, etc.) that may cause surface defects. However, from the standpoint of the practicality, currently, it is still difficult to obtain a synthetic polymer that works as well as or better than HEC. As growing demands are expected for the quality of polished surfaces in the future, it is useful to provide a polishing composition with which surface defects can be efficiently reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances described above. An objective thereof is to provide a polishing composition with which surface defects can be efficiently reduced.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention provides a polishing composition comprising a water-soluble polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. The main chain of the water-soluble polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is formed with a non-cationic region as its main structural part and a cationic region located at least at one end of the main chain.

The use of the polishing composition comprising the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>and abrasive can increase the polishing rate by the mechanical work of the abrasive and efficiently reduce surface defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The polishing composition disclosed herein can be preferably used for polishing silicon wafers.

<heading id="h-0008">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below. Matters necessary to implement this invention other than those specifically referred to in this description may be understood as design matters to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the conventional art in the pertinent field. The present invention can be implemented based on the contents disclosed in this description and common technical knowledge in the subject field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">&lt;Water-Soluble Polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The polishing composition disclosed herein is characterized by comprising a water-soluble polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>(or simply a polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, hereinafter). In the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, the main chain is formed with a non-cationic region as its main structural part and a cationic region located at least at one end of the main chain. From the standpoint of highly controlling the structure and properties such as the molecular weight distribution, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is preferably a synthetic polymer prepared typically by a polymerization method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In this description, the main chain of a water-soluble polymer refers to the chain structure forming the polymer's backbone. Such a chain structure is formed typically with covalent bonds. When the polymer has two or more molecular chains (typically, each a structural group extending in a linear or branched fashion between terminal groups or branching points), the main chain is the predominant molecular chain relative to which the other chain(s) can be considered pendant(s). In a synthetic polymer, the main chain is generally the most basic polymer chain. For instance, in a graft polymer, regardless of its length, any molecular chain having a structure (e.g. a block structure) different from the main chain (that is, typically a molecular chain derived from a different monomer from the main chain) can be defined as a side chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In this description, the main structural part of a water-soluble polymer's main chain refers to the basic part of the water-soluble polymer's main chain. For instance, when the main chain is divided into three equal parts, it may be defined as a part that exhibits the same properties (e.g. ionicity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) as the central part. In the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, the region other than the terminally located cationic region—i.e. the non-cationic region—is defined as its main structural part. The same applies to the non anionicregion in the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>and the hydrophilic region in the polymer M<sub>L-end </sub>described later. The ratio (molar ratio) of the number of moles of the main structural part in the number of moles of repeat units of the entire water-soluble polymer's main chain (in the number of moles of units derived from polymerizable monomers in case of a synthetic polymer) is usually greater than 50% and suitably 75% or greater (e.g. 90% or greater, typically 95% or greater). The ratio of the number of moles of the main structural part can be 99% or greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, the non-cationic region forming the main structural part is a region that exhibits, as a whole, different ionicity from cationicity, that is, non-cationicity. In other words, as the whole region, it is an anionic or nonionic region. From the standpoint of the protection of the polishing object, etc., the non-cationic region is preferably a region exhibiting nonionicity (i.e. a nonionic region). From the standpoint of the composition's dispersion stability, washability, etc., the non-cationic region is preferably a region exhibiting anionicity (i.e. an anionic region). The non-cationic region is formed with anionic or nonionic repeat units and is preferably essentially free of a cationic repeat unit. Herein, being essentially free of a cationic repeat unit means that in this region, the molar ratio of the cationic repeat unit is below 0.01% (e.g. below 0.001%). In this description, the ionicity (cationicity, anionicity or nonionicity) refers to the ionicity in the polishing composition unless otherwise indicated. For instance, when the polishing composition has a pH of 8 to 12, the ionicity of the region at pH 8 to 12 is considered. The same applies to the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The non-cationic region may comprise at least one species of functional group selected from anionic groups and nonionic groups. From the standpoint of reducing surface defects, it is preferable that the non-cationic region is essentially free of a cationic group. The non-cationic region may have, for instance, an amide structure, heterocyclic structure, vinyl structure (including a structure formed with vinyl group-derived carbon-carbon bonds (—C—C—); the same applies, hereinafter), polyoxyalkylene structure and so on. Especially, a non-cationic region having a vinyl structure in the main chain backbone is preferable in view of the attractive properties relative to substrate surfaces and also in industrial aspects. Examples of the polymer having a non-cationic region include a polyvinyl alcohol, a polymer comprising vinyl alcohol (VA) units, a polyacryloylmorpholine, polyacrylic acid and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">From the standpoint of the hydrophilicity and dispersibility, the non-cationic region is preferably a vinyl alcohol-based region in which the molar ratio of the VA unit as a repeat unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is 50% or higher. The ratio of the number of moles of the VA unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is more preferably 70% or higher, or yet more preferably 80% or higher (e.g. 90% or higher, typically 95% or higher). All the repeat units in the non-cationic region may consist essentially of VA units. The polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>having a non-cationic region as described above may preferably be a vinyl alcohol-based polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In another preferable embodiment, from the standpoint of reducing surface defects, the non-cationic region is a region (an acryloylmorpholine-based region) in which the molar ratio of the acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) unit as a repeat unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is 50% or higher. The ratio of the number of moles of the ACMO unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is more preferably 70% or higher, or yet more preferably 80% or higher (e.g. 90% or higher, typically 95% or higher). All the repeat units in the non-cationic region may consist essentially of ACMO units. The polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>having a non-cationic region as described above may preferably be an acryloylmorpholine-based polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The cationic region present in the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is a region that exhibits cationicity as a whole and is located at least at one end of the main chain. In this description, an end of a main chain refers to a segment that includes a terminus of the main chain. Accordingly, a region located at one end of the main chain can be considered a region over a certain range extending at least from the one terminus of the main chain in the direction towards the center of the main chain. The polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>disclosed herein has a cationic region at an end of its main chain, thereby being able to reduce surface defects when the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface (e.g. a silica abrasive in a basic atmosphere). A reason for this can be, but not particularly limited to, for instance, the following: It is thought that when the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface, the end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is attracted to the abrasive's anionic surface, whereby the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is attracted only by the end to the abrasive's surface. Such a unique state of attraction is thought to favorably protect the abrasive's surface, thereby bringing about the effect to reduce surface defects (e.g. scratches and PID (polishing induced defect)) while producing a practical polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The cationic region is preferably present only at one end of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>'s main chain. This can further reduce surface defects. When the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>having the aforementioned structure is thought to be attracted only at the particular end to the abrasive and suitably separated from the abrasive at the other end. It is thought that this state inhibits aggregation of the abrasive via the water-soluble polymer; and therefore, surface defects caused by the aggregation can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The cationic region disclosed herein has at least one cationic group. The maximum number of cationic groups in the cationic region is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of the dispersion stability of the composition, it is suitably about 50 or below (e.g. 10 or below, typically 5 or below). The number of cationic groups in the cationic region is preferably one or two. As the cationic group, an organic cationic group is preferable. Examples include cationic groups derived from amino groups (including derivatives of primary and secondary amines), imine groups, amidino groups, imidazolino groups, etc. Typical examples include amino groups, imine groups, amidino groups, imidazolino groups and the like that are neutralized and cationized with internal (intramolecular) acids, such as ammonium, um, amidino, imidazolium salts, etc. The cationic group may be in a quaternary ammonium form. In particular, an amino group neutralized and cationized with an internal (intramolecular) acid is preferable. The art disclosed herein can be implemented particularly preferably in an embodiment comprising a polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>in which a cationic region having an amino group is placed at an end of the main chain having a vinyl alcohol-based region as the non-cationic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The cationic region can also be formed with cationic repeat units. It is preferable that this region is essentially free of anionic and nonionic repeat units. Herein, being essentially free of anionic and nonionic repeat units means that the molar ratio of anionic and nonionic repeat units in this region is below 0.01% (e.g. below 0.001%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The cationic group is preferably present at a terminus of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. By this, when the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>arranges itself to suitably protect the abrasive's surface and preferably reduce surface defects caused by the abrasive. From the standpoint of combining protection from and dispersibility of the abrasive, the cationic group is preferably present only at a terminus of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>and more preferably only at one terminus of the main chain. In this case, for instance, a single cationic group may happen to be present in the cationic region, yet such a structure can also bring about an excellent effect to reduce surface defects. In general, while the overall nature of a water-soluble polymer is determined on the whole of its repeat units, its termini are highly mobile. Thus, the chemical structure and conformation of the termini have significant impact on the polymer's behavior, particularly its dissociative/associative reaction behavior. The art disclosed herein is made to contribute to reduction of surface defects, taking advantage of the nature of the termini.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The ratio of the number of moles of the cationic region in the number of moles of repeat units in the entire main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is usually below 50% and suitably 25% or below (e.g. 10% or below, typically 5% or below). The ratio of the number of moles of the cationic region can be 1% or below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The method for introducing the cationic region is not particularly limited. For instance, by using a cationic group-containing polymerization initiator in preparing the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, a cationic region can be introduced into an end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. Alternatively, when preparing the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, a cationic region can be introduced by using a cationic group-containing chain transfer agent or a cationic group-containing polymerization terminator. A structure having a cationic region at an end of the main chain can be obtained by preparing a block copolymer formed with a cationic group-containing repeat unit block (typically a block formed with a cationic region (a cationic block)) and a block (non-cationic block) formed with a non-cationic region by a known polymerization method. In particular, it is preferable to introduce the cationic region by using a polymerization initiator having a cationic group since it can introduce the cationic group into a terminus of the main chain. In this case, the cationic group is derived from the polymerization initiator. An example of the cationic group-containing polymerization initiator is a polymerization initiator having an organic cationic group such as an amino group. The polymerization initiator is preferably an azo-based initiator. Specific examples thereof include 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) (V-50), 2,2′-azobis(2-(2-imidazoline-2-yl)propane) hydrochloride, and the like in accordance with applicable half-life temperatures. In an example of the method using a chain transfer agent, after radical polymerization is carried out in the presence of an amino group-containing thiol such as aminoethanethiol, a terminus of the chain is cationized with hydrochloric acid, etc. In this case, aminoethanethiol can be neutralized in advance with hydrochloric acid, etc. In this embodiment, the cationic group is derived from the chain transfer agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">When the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>has one or more side chains besides the main chain, these side chains may also be non-cationic. For instance, the side chains may exhibit the same ionicity as the non-cationic region in the main chain The polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>disclosed herein may be non-cationic except the cationic region located at least at one end (preferably only at one end) of the main chain. Accordingly, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>disclosed herein may be formed with a cationic region located at least at one end (preferably only at one end) of the main chain and a non-cationic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The type of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>is not particularly limited. For instance, among the water-soluble polymers listed later as examples, a species that can serve as the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>(typically a water-soluble polymer having a non-cationic region in the main chain) can be preferably used. For the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, solely one species or a combination of two or more species can be used. In particular, a vinyl alcohol-based polymer is more preferable. For instance, as the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, a vinyl alcohol-based polymer having a cationic region at an end of the main chain can be preferably used. As the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, a vinyl alcohol-based polymer having a cationic group (e.g. an amino group) at a terminus of the main chain is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, an acryloylmorpholine-based polymer can be preferably used as the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. A specific example of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>according to a preferable embodiment is an acryloylmorpholine-based polymer having a cationic group (e.g. an amino group) at a terminus of the main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the art disclosed herein, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>content in the total amount of the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of obtaining the effect of the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>to a greater extent, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>content in the total amount of the water-soluble polymer is suitably 10% by weight or greater (e.g. 30% by weight or greater, typically 50% by weight or greater). For a similar reason, the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>content is preferably 70% by weight or greater (e.g. 90% by weight or greater, typically 95% by weight or greater). The water-soluble polymer may essentially consist of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. The upper limit of polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>content in the total amount of the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of obtaining the effect of its use in combination with other water-soluble polymer(s), the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>content in the total amount of the water-soluble polymer can be 90% by weight or less (e.g. 70% by weight or less, typically 50% by weight or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Water-Soluble Polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">It is preferable that the polishing composition disclosed herein further comprises a water-soluble polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>(or simply a polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>hereinafter) in addition to the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>. The main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is formed with a non-anionic region as its main structural part and an anionic region located at least at one end of the main chain. For a similar reason as for the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>, the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is preferably a synthetic polymer prepared by a polymerization method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>, the non-anionic region forming the main structural part refers to a region that exhibits, as a whole, different ionicity from anionicity, that is, non-anionicity.

From the standpoint of the protection of the polishing object, etc., the non-anionic region is preferably a region exhibiting nonionicity (i.e. a nonionic region). From the standpoint of attraction to the abrasive, the non-anionic region is preferably a region exhibiting cationicity (i.e. a cationic region). The non-anionic region is preferably formed with cationic and nonionic repeat units, but essentially free of an anionic repeat unit. Herein, being essentially free of an anionic repeat unit means that in this region, the molar ratio of the anionic repeat unit is below 0.01% (e.g. below 0.001%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The non-ionic region may comprise at least one species of functional group selected from cationic groups and nonionic groups. From the standpoint of reducing surface defects, the non-anionic region is preferably essentially free of an anionic group. It is more preferably a nonionic region. The non-anionic region may have, for instance, an amide structure, quaternary nitrogen structure, heterocyclic structure, vinyl structure, polyoxyalkylene structure, etc. Especially, a non-anionic region having a vinyl structure in its main chain backbone is preferable in view of the attractive properties relative to substrate surfaces and also in industrial aspects.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, from the standpoint of reducing surface defects, the non-anionic region may be a region in which the molar ratio of the acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) unit and/or vinylpyrrolidone (VP) unit as repeat units in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is 50% or higher. For instance, it is preferably an acryloylmorpholine-based region in which the molar ratio of the ACMO unit as a repeat unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is 50% or higher. Alternatively, it is preferably a vinylpyrrolidone-based region in which the molar ratio of the VP unit as a repeat unit in the number of moles of all repeat units in the region is 50% or higher.

The polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>disclosed herein has an anionic region at an end of its main chain, thereby being able to reduce surface defects when the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface. A reason for this can be the following: When the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface, the end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>repels the abrasive's anionic surface to inhibit aggregation of the abrasive; and therefore, in the polishing composition, a well-dispersed state is achieved. The well-dispersed state (initial dispersibility) further contributes to increase the washability after polishing and inhibit abrasive-derived aggregates from remaining after cleaning. As a result, it may bring about the effect to reduce surface defects (e.g. PID). The M<sub>A-end </sub>being not associated with the abrasive will bring about increased protection of substrate surfaces during polishing, whereby haze reduction can be expected. As described above, the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>contributes to reduction of surface defects by a different mechanism from the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. Thus, the combined use of the polymers M<sub>C-end </sub>and M<sub>A-end </sub>can reduce surface defects to a greater extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The anionic region is preferably present only at one end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>. For instance, when the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface and the non-anionic region of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is cationic, the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is likely to be attracted to the abrasive and aggregates are likely to be formed from the abrasive. However, with the anionic region being present only at one end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>, the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>stays off the abrasive at the particular end. This brings about great dispersibility and increased washability. Such a state further contributes to reduction of surface defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The anionic region disclosed herein has at least one anionic group. The maximum number of anionic groups in the anionic region is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of obtaining good attraction to the abrasive, it is suitably about 50 or below (e.g. 10 or below, typically 5 or below). The number of anionic groups in the anionic region is preferably one or two. As the anionic group, an organic anionic group is preferable. Examples include anionic groups derived from carboxyl group, hydroxyl group, sulfo group, sulfuric acid group, phosphoric acid group, phosphonic acid group, etc. Typical examples are conjugate bases of carboxyl group, hydroxyl group, sulfo group, sulfuric acid group, phosphoric acid group, phosphonic acid group, etc. In particular, the conjugate base(s) of carboxyl group and/or hydroxyl group is preferable and the conjugate base of carboxyl group is more preferable. The art disclosed herein can be particularly preferably implemented in an embodiment comprising a polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>in which a carboxyl group-containing anionic region is placed at an end of its main chain having a vinyl alcohol-based region as the non-anionic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The anionic region may be a region formed with anionic repeat units. This region is preferably essentially free of cationic and nonionic repeat units. Herein, being essentially free of cationic and nonionic repeat units means that the molar ratio of cationic and nonionic repeat units in the region is below 0.01% (e.g. below 0.001%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The anionic group is preferably present at a terminus of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>. By this, when the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is present with an abrasive having an anionic surface, the terminus of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>repels and stays off the abrasive having the anionic surface, bringing about a well-dispersed state. From the standpoint of combining surface protection and dispersibility of the abrasive, the anionic group is preferably present only at a terminus of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>and more preferably only at one terminus of the main chain. In this case, for instance, a single anionic group may happen to be present in the anionic region, yet such a structure can also bring about great dispersion and an excellent effect to reduce surface defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The ratio of the number of moles of the anionic region in the number of moles of repeat units in the entire main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is usually below 50% and suitably 25% or below (e.g. 10% or below, typically 5% or below). The ratio of the number of moles of the anionic region can even be 1% or below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The method for introducing the anionic region is not particularly limited. For instance, by preparing the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>by using a polymerization initiator having an anionic group, the anionic region can be introduced into an end of the main chain of the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>. Alternatively, in preparing the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>, the anionic region can be introduced by the use of a chain transfer agent having an anionic group or a polymerization terminator having an anionic group. A structure having an anionic region at an end of the main chain can be obtained by preparing a block copolymer formed with an anionic group-containing repeat unit block (typically a block formed with an anionic region (an anionic block)) and a block (non-anionic block) formed with a non-anionic region by a known polymerization method. In particular, it is preferable to introduce the anionic region by using a polymerization initiator having an anionic group since it can introduce the anionic group into a terminus of the main chain. In this case, the anionic group is derived from the polymerization initiator. An example of the anionic group-containing polymerization initiator is a polymerization initiator having an organic anionic group such as carboxyl group. The polymerization initiator is preferably an azo-based initiator. Specific examples thereof include 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) (ACOA), 2,2′-azobis(isobutyric acid), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpentanoic acid), etc. In an example of the method using a chain transfer agent, radical polymerization is carried out in the presence of a carboxyl group-containing thiol such as mercaptopropionic acid to introduce an anionic group into one terminus of the polymer. In this case, the carboxyl group can be neutralized in advance with potassium hydroxide, etc. In this embodiment, the anionic group is derived from the chain transfer agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">When the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>has one or more side chains besides the main chain, these side chains may also be non-anionic. For instance, the side chains may exhibit the same ionicity as the non-anionic region in the main chain. The polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>disclosed herein is non-anionic except at the anionic region located at least at one end (preferably only at one end) of the main chain. Accordingly, the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>disclosed herein may consist of an anionic region located at least at one end (preferably only at one end) of the main chain and a non-anionic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The type of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>is not particularly limited. For instance, among the water-soluble polymers listed later as examples, a species that can serve as the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>(typically a water-soluble polymer having a non-anionic region in the main chain) can be preferably used. For the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>, solely one species or a combination of two or more species can be used. In particular, a vinyl alcohol-based polymer, acryloylmorpholine-based polymer and vinylpyrrolidone-based polymer are more preferable; a vinyl alcohol-based polymer and acryloylmorpholine-based polymer are even more preferable; and a vinyl alcohol-based polymer is particularly preferable. For instance, as the polymer M<sub>A-end</sub>, an acryloylmorpholine-based polymer having an anionic region at an end of the main chain can be preferably used. A specific example of the polymer M<sub>A-end </sub>according to a preferable embodiment is a vinyl alcohol-based polymer having an anionic group (e.g. carboxyl group) at a terminus of the main chain.</div>

From the standpoint of producing the effect of the combined use of the polymers M<sub>C-end </sub>and M<sub>A-end </sub>to a greater extent, their usage ratio (M<sub>C-end</sub>:M<sub>A-end</sub>) is suitably 5:95 to 95:5 or preferably 10:90 to 90:10 (e.g. 20:80 to 80:20) by weight.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">In such a basic abrasive dispersion containing both the abrasive and basic compound, the abrasive exhibits greater electrostatic repulsion due to the basic compound and thus shows higher dispersion stability than a basic compound-free abrasive dispersion (typically almost neutral). Accordingly, local aggregation of the abrasive is less likely to occur as compared with an embodiment where the basic compound is added after addition of the water-soluble polymer to a neutral abrasive dispersion and an embodiment where the neutral abrasive dispersion, water-soluble polymer and basic compound are mixed all at once.

By rinsing it with the rinse solution comprising the same components as the polishing composition but without the abrasive, defects and haze can be further reduced, without hindering the effect of, for instance, the water-soluble polymer (e.g. polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) attracted on the surface of the polishing object (e.g. a silicon wafer). Such a rinse solution may typically be a silicon wafer polishing composition that comprises a water-soluble polymer (e.g. polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) and water (in particular, a composition used for rinsing in the polishing of silicon wafers, also called a rinse composition). The composition, etc., of the rinse composition is basically the same as the polishing composition described above except for the absence of the abrasive. Thus, the description is not repeated here.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">As shown in Table 1, Examples 1 to 3 which used polishing compositions each comprising, as the water-soluble polymer, PVA-A (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) or PVA-B (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) having a cationic region at one end of the main chain (more specifically, a cationic group at one terminus of the main chain) achieved excellent polishing rates and were superior in reducing scratches as compared to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 using no polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>as the water-soluble polymer. Examples 4 and 5 which used polishing compositions each comprising, as the water-soluble polymer, PACMO-A (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) or PACMO-B (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) having a cationic region at one end of the main chain (more specifically, a cationic group at one terminus of the main chain) achieved excellent polishing rates and were superior in reducing scratches as compared to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 not using any M<sub>C-end </sub>as the water-soluble polymer. On the other hand, a significantly larger number of scratches were observed in Comparative Example 3 using the cation-modified PVA with cationic groups being randomly present in the main chain. From these results, it is evident that the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>efficiently reduced surface defects by having the cationic region at one end of the main chain, but not randomly. It is presumed that this effect is brought about by the polymer M<sub>C-end </sub>being attracted only at the end to the abrasive.</div>

From this result, it is presumed that the polymer M<sub>L-end </sub>contributed to reduction of scratches by a different mechanism from that of the polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>. In particular, the polymer M<sub>L-end </sub>is considered to have contributed to reduction of scratches by being attracted well to the surface of the polishing object (silicon wafer).</div>

Example 5 using PACMO-B (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) having a larger molecular weight in place of PACMO-A (polymer M<sub>C-end</sub>) used in Example 4 exhibited a higher polishing rate and yet more superior scratch-reducing nature as compared to Example 4.</div>
