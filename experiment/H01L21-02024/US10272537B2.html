<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing processing method for efficiently polishing a surface of a GaN single crystal material into a mirror surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Although electronic devices such as semiconductor integrated circuits are often constructed on silicon single crystal substrates, single crystal substrates made of gallium nitride GaN having better electric characteristics are expected to be used for power devices etc. requiring a function of controlling comparatively large electric power, instead of the silicon single crystal substrates. Since a power device using such a single crystal substrate made of gallium nitride GaN can deal with a large amount of electric power, generates small amount of heat, and can be miniaturized, the power device is preferably used as a control element controlling the number of rotations or torque of a motor or an electric generator in a hybrid vehicle, a fuel-cell vehicle, etc. The single crystal substrates made of gallium nitride GaN are excellent in high frequency characteristics and are expected to be developed into wireless communication stations, relay stations, mobile stations, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In a typically employed manufacturing method employed for manufacturing of VLSI, a multiplicity of chips are formed on a semiconductor wafer, which is cut into respective chip sizes in a final process. Since a degree of integration is recently dramatically increased in association with improvements in VLSI manufacturing technology and wirings are increasingly multilayered, planarization of an entire semiconductor wafer (global planarization) is required in a process of forming each layer. One of the techniques of achieving such planarization of an entire semiconductor wafer is a polishing method referred to as a CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) method. In the CMP method, while a nonwoven fabric or a polishing pad such as a foam pad affixed to a surface plate is pressed against a wafer and forcibly rotated, a slurry (a dense suspension with fine powder dispersed in liquid such as an aqueous alkali solution) containing fine polishing particles (loose abrasive grains) is allowed to flow thereto for polishing. This CMP method achieves comparatively accurate polishing processing because of a synergetic effect between chemical polishing with a liquid component and mechanical polishing with polishing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in such a conventional CMP method, a considerable time is spent for the polishing processing. If a loose abrasive grain polishing processing using diamond abrasive grains as polishing particles is performed, surface roughness becomes as large as Ra=10 nm, for example, although a certain level of processing efficiency is provided. In contrast, if a loose abrasive grain polishing processing is performed by using silica abrasive grains, the surface roughness becomes smaller; however, the processing efficiency deteriorates and scratches of unknown cause inconveniently tend to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In this regard, a polishing processing method for polishing a SiC single crystal substrate is proposed. For example, this corresponds to a polishing processing method described in Patent Document 1.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Problem to Be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The polishing processing method of Patent Document 1 is based on finding of a specific polishing processing condition on which a high polishing efficiency is provided along with a low surface roughness of a SiC single crystal substrate with respect to ranges of hydrogen ion concentration pH and oxidation-reduction potential Eh of a polishing liquid. However, it is inappropriate to apply such a polishing processing condition directly to a single crystal substrate made of gallium nitride GaN, polishing processing of which is more difficult than the SiC single crystal substrate, and it is difficult to efficiently reduce the surface roughness of the single crystal substrate made of gallium nitride GaN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was conceived in view of the situations and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a polishing processing method achieving sufficient polishing efficiency and polishing performance in polishing using a CMP method for a single crystal substrate made of gallium nitride GaN which is a material more difficult to process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result of intensive continuous studies for developing such a method of polishing a material difficult to process by using a CMP method, the present inventors found out that, in a polishing processing method using a CMP method for polishing a surface of a crystal material to be smooth by using a polishing pad in the presence of a polishing liquid and polishing particles, polishing efficiency and polishing performance are made remarkably excellent for a single crystal substrate made of gallium nitride GaN which is the material difficult to process, by dissolving an oxidizing agent to impart oxidizability to the polishing liquid in specific regions existing respectively for a fixed polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad and a loose polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad with respect to ranges of oxidation-reduction potential Eh and pH of the polishing liquid. The present invention was conceived based on this knowledge.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, a first aspect of the invention provides a polishing processing method (a) using a CMP method for polishing a surface of a crystal material to be smooth by using a loose polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad in the presence of a polishing liquid and a plurality of polishing abrasive grains, wherein (b) the crystal material is a single crystal of GaN, and wherein (c) the polishing liquid is an oxidizing polishing liquid having an oxidation-reduction potential between Ehmin (determined by Eq. (1)) mV and Ehmax (determined by Eq. (2)) mV and pH between 0.1 and 6.5:
<br/>
Ehmin (mV)=−33.9 pH+750  (1)
<br/>
Ehmax (mV)=−82.1 pH+1491  (2).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">That is, a second aspect of the invention provides a polishing processing method (d) using a CMP method for polishing a surface of a crystal material to be smooth by using a fixed polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad in the presence of a polishing liquid and a plurality of polishing abrasive grains, wherein (e) the crystal material is a single crystal of GaN, and wherein (f) the polishing liquid is an oxidizing polishing liquid having an oxidation-reduction potential between Ehmin (determined by Eq.

<heading id="h-0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the first aspect of the invention, in polishing processing using a CMP method, a loose polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad is used for polishing a surface of a crystal material that is a single crystal of GaN in the presence of an oxidizing polishing liquid having an oxidation-reduction potential between Ehmin (determined by Eq. (1)) [mV] and Ehmax (determined by Eq. (2)) [mV] and pH between 0.1 and 6.5, and therefore, a high polishing efficiency can preferably be provided while a low surface roughness is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the second aspect of the invention, in polishing processing using a CMP method, a fixed polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad is used for polishing a surface of a crystal material that is a single crystal of GaN in the presence of an oxidizing polishing liquid having an oxidation-reduction potential between Ehmin (determined by Eq. (3)) [mV] and Ehmax (determined by Eq. (4)) [mV] and pH between 0.12 and 5.7, and therefore, a high polishing efficiency can preferably be provided while a low surface roughness is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the loose polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad is made of a hard polyurethane resin, and the polishing abrasive grains are loose abrasive grains contained in the polishing liquid supplied to the polishing pad. As a result, a higher polishing efficiency and a low surface roughness are provided, and a polishing accuracy is improved in terms of flatness etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the oxidizing polishing liquid has potassium permanganate, potassium bichromate, or potassium thiosulphate added thereto as an oxidation-reduction potential adjustment agent.

As a result, since the polishing abrasive grains are contained in the communicating pores of the matrix resin, a higher polishing efficiency and a low surface roughness are provided. A consumed amount of the polishing abrasive grains is reduced, which enables the use of expensive polishing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the matrix resin of the fixed polishing abrasive grain type polishing pad is made of an epoxy resin or a polyethersulfone (PES) resin.

This advantageously enables the use of polishing abrasive grains with hardness corresponding to an object to be polished on which a favorable surface roughness can be achieved. Preferably, the polishing abrasive grains have the average grain diameter in a range of 0.005 to 10 (μm) and, in the case of silica, for example, fumed silica (silica microparticles acquired by high-temperature combustion of silicon tetrachloride, chlorosilane, etc. in the presence of hydrogen and oxygen) etc. are preferably used.

As a result, a higher polishing efficiency is provided, and a surface roughness is reduced.</div>
