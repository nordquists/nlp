<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, a method for producing a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, and a method for inspecting a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A silicon carbide semiconductor has a dielectric breakdown electric field strength, an electron saturated drift velocity, and a thermal conductivity higher than those of a silicon semiconductor. Therefore, research and development has been made to realize power devices using a silicon carbide semiconductor that are capable of performing a large current operation at a higher temperature and a higher speed than those of a conventional silicon device. A motor used for electric bicycles, electric automobiles and hybrid vehicles are AC-driven or inverter-controlled. Development of a highly efficient switching device usable for such uses, among the above-described power devices, is now a target of attention. In order to realize such a power device, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate on which a high quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer is to be epitaxially grown is necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 3761546, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is produced as follows, like other single crystalline semiconductor substrates. A substrate having a predetermined thickness is cut out from an ingot. After a surface of the substrate is flattened by mechanical polishing, the substrate is processed by chemical mechanical polishing (hereinafter, referred to simply as “CMP”) to increase the flatness and the smoothness of the surface thereof to an atomic order. Thus, the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is produced. However, single crystalline silicon carbide is harder and is more highly corrosion-resistant than other semiconductors. Therefore, single crystalline silicon carbide is not highly processable to be formed into such a substrata, and it is generally difficult to produce a highly smooth single-crystal silicon carbide substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">On a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, a silicon carbide semiconductor layer is formed by epitaxial growth. Therefore, the quality of the silicon carbide semiconductor layer significantly relies on the quality of the surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. For example, the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate contains stacking faults, dislocation defects or the like. The surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate has, for example, various scratches such as parts denatured by processing, scratches, microscratches or the like. This causes faults or defects in the silicon carbide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to obtain a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate on which a high quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer is to be epitaxially grown, the surface of such a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate needs to be evaluated so that the above-described defects suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of method for the evaluation is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No, 2011-220744. The method is as follows. The surface of the substrate is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray having a predetermined wavelength. From photoluminescence light obtained from the substrate, light of a predetermined wavelength is removed. As a result, a photoluminescence image on the longer wavelength side is obtained. From a brightness difference between this image and a part adjacent thereto, a stacking fault is distinguished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A scratch or the like at the surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate that forms a part of a processing-derived defect may be observed by an optical method of using, for example, an optical microscope, an optical interference-system surface roughness meter or the like.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As a result of studying the surface of a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in detail, the present inventors suggested the following: defects are present at the surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, which is determined as being smooth by an optical method or the like, and are also present inside the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. The present invention suppresses generation of the defects that are not observed by a conventional method. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">First, the present inventors attempted to confirm the presence of hidden defects at a surface of a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, determined as being smooth by an optical method or the like, by use of a mirror electron microscope (MEM). The mirror electron microscope was used for the following reason. The mirror electron microscope visualizes an equipotential surface of an observation target, and therefore is believed by the present inventors to capture a change in the equipotential surface caused by a hidden defect. The mirror electron microscope will be described in detail later. According to the detailed studies made by the present inventors, the defects that are not observed by a conventional optical method or the like are considered to be present in an area from the surface to the inside of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, and are observed by the mirror electron microscope as being striped. Based on these, it has been found that the defects have different equipotential surfaces in stripes. Hereinafter, such a cause of the change in the equipotential surface will be referred to as a “hidden scratch”. The hidden scratches are presumed to be parts of a strained layer (crushed layer) generated inside the substrate at the time of mechanical polishing performed on the surface of the substrate and remaining without being removed by polishing performed later, or parts generated inside the substrate by CMP or the like and having a different quality from that of the uniform material used for forming the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In this specification, the term “main surface” refers to a face on which a silicon carbide semiconductor layer is formed among a plurality of faces of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. The term “main surface” also refers to a conceptual face defining the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. The term “surface” refers to an exposed area of the conceptual face. Therefore, the main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is kept the same even after the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is polished. By contrast, the exposed surface of the main surface is changed after the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the studies made by the present inventors, the main surface, of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, having hidden scratches is as flat as a plane having atoms. Therefore, the hidden scratches are not confirmed to be present by the method disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3761546 or the optical interference-system surface roughness meter disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2011-220744 or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2008-288240; more specifically, for example, a wafer surface inspection device (e.g., Candela of KLA) usable for a common optical method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The hidden scratches are present inside the substrate, and therefore, are generally considered as being difficult to be detected by non-destructive inspection. For example, it has been reported that the defects inside a GaN substrate are observed by use of cathode luminescence (e.g., Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2010-254576). However, the GaN substrate is formed of a direct bandgap semiconductor. The silicon carbide substrate, which is formed of an indirect bandgap semiconductor, cannot be inspected by substantially the same method. In the case where, as in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2008-166329, destructive inspection is used to detect the defects, observation is performed by a high resolution method. Therefore, the field of view is narrow and it is difficult to observe a large area of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In view of such problems, the present inventors conceived using a mirror electron microscope to observe the hidden scratches in the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. The present inventors also conceived evaluating the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate based on the density of the hidden scratches observed by the mirror electron microscope, and also a method for producing a high quality single-crystal silicon carbide substrate with few hidden scratches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinafter, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, a method for producing the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, and a method for inspecting the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in an embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">(Mirror Electron Microscope)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">First, a mirror electron microscope will be described. The mirror electron microscope is explained in, for example, Hitachi Review, February 2012 issue, pages 46-51. The mirror electron microscope is a type of electron microscope. An electron beam directed toward a sample is decelerated and inverted immediately before the sample, and the returned beam is focused to form an image by an electron lens to allow a surface state of the sample to be observed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a structure of such a mirror electron microscope. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a mirror electron microscope <b>11</b> includes an electron source <b>12</b>, a first electron lens <b>14</b>, a separator <b>16</b>, a second electron lens <b>21</b>, a fluorescent plate <b>22</b>, and an image capturing device <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The electron source <b>12</b> is connected with a power source <b>13</b>, and emits an electron beam <b>15</b>. The electron beam <b>15</b> is converged by the first electron lens <b>14</b>, passes the separator <b>16</b>, and advances toward a surface of a sample <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The sample <b>18</b> is electrically insulated from, and is supported on, a stage. The sample <b>18</b> is provided with a negative potential by a power source <b>17</b>. Because of the negative potential provided to the sample <b>18</b>, the electron beam <b>15</b> is inverted in the vicinity of the surface of the sample <b>18</b> without colliding against the sample <b>18</b> and advances away from the sample <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The electron beam returning from the sample <b>18</b> (such an electron beam is referred to as the “electron beam <b>20</b>”) passes the separator <b>16</b> and is converged by the second electron lens <b>21</b>. The separator <b>16</b> separates an optical path for the electron beam <b>15</b> advancing toward the sample <b>18</b> and an optical path for the electron beam <b>20</b> returning from the sample <b>18</b> from each other. As a result, an image is formed at a surface of the fluorescent plate <b>22</b>. The image capturing device <b>23</b> captures the image formed at the fluorescent plate <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, the mirror electron microscope <b>11</b> uses the electron beam inverted at the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. Therefore, an image of a shape reflecting the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the surface of the sample <b>18</b> and also an image of a shape reflecting the distribution of electrons in an area from the surface to the inside of the sample <b>18</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> each schematically show a surface shape of the sample <b>18</b> and the distribution of electrons inside the sample <b>18</b> as observed by the mirror electron microscope, as well as the electron beam influenced by the surface shape and the distribution of electrons. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a convexed portion <b>18</b> <i>a </i>is present at the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. In this case, the equipotential surface at the surface of the sample <b>18</b> protrudes at the convexed portion <b>18</b> <i>a</i>. The electron beam is considered to be scattered as expanding at the protruding portion of the equipotential surface. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the surface of the sample <b>18</b> is flat but negative charges are locally present in the vicinity of the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. In this case, similar to the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the electron beam is scattered as expanding at the portion where the negative charges are locally present. In this case, a portion of the image formed by the second electron lens <b>21</b> that corresponds to the portion where the electron beam is scattered is darker than the rest of the image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a concaved portion <b>18</b> <i>b </i>is present at the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. In this case, the equipotential surface at the surface of the sample <b>18</b> is recessed at the concaved portion <b>18</b> <i>b</i>. The electron beam is considered to be converged at the recessed portion of the equipotential surface. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the surface of the sample <b>18</b> is flat but positive charges are locally present in the vicinity of the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. In this case, similar to the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the electron beam is converged at the portion where the positive charges are locally present. In this case, a portion of the image formed by the second electron lens <b>21</b> that corresponds to the portion where the electron beam is converged is brighter than the rest of the image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, in the case where the sample <b>18</b> is observed by the mirror electron microscope, the sample <b>18</b> is biased to a negative potential. Therefore, in the case where a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is used as the sample <b>18</b>, if the substrate has hidden scratches, charges are locally present at the hidden scratches in relation to the negative potential at the surface of the sample <b>18</b>. For this reason, even if the surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is flat, an image of the hidden scratches inside the substrate is captured and thus the hidden scratches are observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The sample is observed by the mirror electron microscope based on the above-described principle. Therefore, especially in the case where the surface of the sample is highly insulating, the sample may possibly be charge up. Even in this case, the charge-up, namely, the accumulation of the electrons in the sample, may reflect, to some extent, the surface shape of the sample or the uniformity of materials inside the sample. However, in the case where the amount of the accumulated electrons is excessively large, the microscopic surface shape, or the distribution of materials inside the sample that are to be observed, may not possibly be reflected on the equipotential surface. In such a case, it is preferably to remove the charge-up of the sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Now, it is assumed that the sample is a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. When, for example, the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray having an energy larger than, or equal to, the bandgap of silicon carbide (3.2 eV) forming the substrate, hole-electron pairs are generated in the substrate. The generated holes, when being bonded with the electrons, decrease the electrons, which causes the charge-up. In addition, the ultraviolet ray invades the inside of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate to some extent. For example, an ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 365 nm (energy: 3.4 eV) invades the inside of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate to a depth of about 120 μm. The electrons of the generated hole-electron pairs are considered to be trapped in the hidden scratches inside the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate as a result of the invasion. Therefore, in the case where the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is observed by the mirror electron microscope while being irradiated with the ultraviolet ray, even when an electron beam is directed toward a main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate at an accelerated voltage of 5 keV or less, the charge-up is suppressed and the contrast of the hidden scratches in the captured image is increased. Thus, the hidden scratches are made easier to observe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, in the case where the main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is observed by the mirror electron microscope, the captured image shows hidden scratches that are shown brighter or darker than the rest. Detailed studies made by the present inventors have found that such hidden scratches are generated in the mechanical polishing step and the CMP step performed during the production of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">As can be seen from the above, for producing a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate, generation of hidden scratches is prevented as much as possible, and the hidden scratches, if generated, are removed as much as possible. In this manner, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate which has few hidden scratches and allows a high quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer to be formed thereon is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">(Method for Producing a Single-Crystal Silicon Carbide Substrate)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Hereinafter, a method for producing a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in an embodiment will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a flowchart showing one method for producing a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate according to the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> are cross-sectional views showing steps of the method for producing the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">First, in step S<b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate <b>30</b> having a main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>is prepared. The single-crystal silicon carbide substrate <b>30</b> is obtained by slicing a part of a single crystalline silicon carbide ingot of a desired polytype such that the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>has a desired crystal orientation. There is no specific limitation on the thickness, the size or the crystal orientation of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate <b>30</b>. The thickness, the size and the crystal orientation suitable to the use may be selected. For example, the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate <b>30</b> has a thickness of 200 μm or greater and 600 μm or less, and a diameter of 2 inches or greater and 8 inches or less. The crystal orientation of the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>may be, for example, (0001), (000-1) or the like in the case where the silicon carbide is of hexagonal crystal, and may be (111) or the like in the case where the silicon carbide is of cubic crystal. The main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>may be inclined from such an orientation at an angle of 0 degrees or greater and 1 degree or less. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a strained layer (processing-denatured layer) <b>33</b> is formed at the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate <b>30</b>. The strained layer <b>33</b> is generated at the time of slicing of the single crystalline silicon carbide ingot.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The mechanical polishing gradually decreases the surface roughness of a surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>(<b>1</b>) of the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>.

However, the abrasive grain used for the mechanical polishing newly generates a strained layer at scratches <b>34</b> or at a level deeper than the scratches <b>34</b>. Such a strained layer becomes hidden scratches <b>30</b> <i>d</i>(<i>a</i>). The density of the hidden scratches <b>30</b> <i>d</i>(<i>a</i>) depends on the depth of the scratches <b>34</b>, namely, the roughness of the surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>(<b>1</b>) of the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>. Therefore, the post-mechanical polishing roughness of the surface of the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>(i.e., surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>(<b>2</b>)) is preferably as small as possible. Specifically, the post-mechanical polishing roughness Ra of the surface <b>30</b> <i>s</i>(<b>2</b>) of the main surface <b>30</b> <i>s </i>is preferably Ra≤about 5 nm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">(Method for Inspecting the Single-Crystal Silicon Carbide Substrate and the Single-Crystal Silicon Carbide Substrate in this Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Now a method for inspecting a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in this embodiment will be described. The method for inspecting a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in this embodiment is as follows. A single-crystal silicon carbide substrate having a polished main surface is observed by a mirror electron microscope while being irradiated with an electron beam or with an electron beam and an ultraviolet ray. Based on the ratio of hidden scratches at the main surface, it is determined whether the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is good or poor. A conventional method for inspecting a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate does not detect a hidden scratch in a non-destructive manner. By contrast, the method in this embodiment evaluates whether there is a hidden scratch or not. The ratio of hidden scratches is controlled, so that it is determined whether the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is of a high quality or not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">For observing the main surface by the mirror electron microscope, it is preferable that the main surface is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray as described above. This suppresses the charge-up of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate and thus allows the hidden scratches to be observed more certainly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In an example of inspection method, the ratio of hidden scratches in the entire plane of the main surface may be used for the evaluation. The “ratio of hidden scratches” is defined as follows. Observation points are set at a predetermined interval at the main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate. The number of the observation points at which the presence of the hidden scratch is confirmed is divided by the total number of the observation points. The resultant value is the “ratio of hidden scratches”. The field of view of the mirror electron microscope at an observation point is, for example, a circle having a diameter of 100 μm or greater and 200 μm or less. The observation points are set at an interval of, for example, 200 μm or greater and less than, or equal to, the radius of the substrate. It is now assumed that a border is set at the middle between two adjacent observation points and an area centering around each observation point is defined as an observation area. In this case, the size of the field of view of the mirror electron microscope with respect to the observation area is preferably 0.0001% or greater and 100% or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">According to this inspection method, in the case where one striped lattice scratch is present over a plurality of observation points, it is evaluated that the plurality of observation areas include the hidden scratch. Therefore, the number of the hidden scratches and also the length and size of the hidden scratches are put into consideration to determine whether the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate good or poor. In the case where ratio of lattice scratches evaluated by this inspection method is less than 50%, SBD (Schottky Barrier Diode) elements produced by a semiconductor process including epitaxial growth in a post step may be produced at an average yield of about 80%, which is adequate. In the case where a MOS FET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) element, which is more influenced by the surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate than the SBD element, is to be produced, the ratio of hidden scratches defined above is preferably less than 10% and more preferably 0%. In she case of the SBD element also, the ratio of hidden scratches is preferably less than 10% in order to increase the yield.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">As can be seen from the above, as a result of using the inspection method in this embodiment, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in which the number of the processing-derived hidden scratches is decreased in a non-destructive manner and which allows a high quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer to be epitaxially grown thereon is selected. A single-crystal silicon carbide substrate having a decreased number of hidden scratches, which are not easily detected by an optical microscope or the like, and allowing a high quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer to be epitaxially grown thereon is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">With the inspection method in this embodiment, the “hidden scratch” is defined as having a length that is at least ½ of the diameter of a circle defining the field of view of the mirror electron microscope and as being striped. As described above, a conceivable reason why the hidden scratch is striped is that the hidden scratch is derived from a scratch made by the mechanical polishing. The criterion based on which a scratch is detected as a hidden scratch is that the hidden scratch has a length that is at least ½ of the diameter of the field of view. Because of this criterion, for example, a scratch is evaluated as a hidden scratch relatively easily, and the evaluation is made at high reproducibility. Specifically, in the case where the diameter of the circle defining the field of view of the mirror electronic microscope is 100 μm, the number of observation points at which the presence of a striped scratch having a length of at least 50 μm is confirmed is found.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In the case where the surface roughness of the main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is large, especially in the case where there are convexed and concaved portions that are not hidden scratches and are observable by an optical method, the hidden scratches may not be easily observed because the image is influenced by the surface roughness. In the case where a thick oxide layer having a thickness exceeding 5 nm is formed at the main surface, the hidden scratches may not be easily observed by charge-up even when the main surface is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray. Therefore, in the case where the density of the hidden scratches is evaluated by use of the mirror electron microscope, it is preferable that the surface roughness Ra of the main surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate is 1 nm or less and that the maximum height Rmax thereof is 10 nm or less. Especially, the surface roughness Ra is preferably 0.2 nm. The thickness of the oxide layer formed at the main surface is preferably 5 nm or less. The maximum height Rmax may be measured by, for example, an AFM like the surface roughness Ra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As described in the following examples, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate produced by the production method in this embodiment may fulfill these conditions. It is now assumed that, for example, specific production conditions or the like are determined based on the method for producing a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in this embodiment, and that the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate produced under the determined conditions is confirmed by the inspection method in this embodiment to fulfill the criterion that the ratio of hidden scratches is less than 50%. In this case, any single-crystal silicon carbide substrate produced under the determined conditions is determined as having a ratio of hidden scratches of less than 50%, even without being inspected by the inspection method in this embodiment. Namely, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in this embodiment is not limited to a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate confirmed by the inspection method in this embodiment as having a ratio of hidden scratches of less than 50%.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">A single-crystal silicon carbide substrate was produced by the production method in this embodiment, and the hidden scratches were observed by the mirror electron microscope. The results will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">A single-crystal silicon carbide substrate was produced by the procedure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>. First, a single crystalline silicon carbide ingot was cut to obtain a substrate having an appropriate thickness (S<b>10</b>, step (A)). An appropriate abrasive grain was selected based on the roughness of the cut surface of the substrate, and the main surface of the substrate was processed to be flat by mechanical polishing or the like (S<b>11</b>, step (B)). For example, a diamond abrasive grain having a center grain diameter of 5 μm was used to polish the main surface such that the surface roughness Ra would be Ra&lt;10 nm. Then, a diamond abrasive grain having a maximum grain diameter of 1 μm and a metal surface plate were used to polish the main surface such that the surface roughness Ra would be Ra&lt;1 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, the main surface was processed by CMP such that the surface roughness Ra would be Ra&lt;0.2 nm, at a polishing amount of 1 μm by use of a slurry containing a main component of colloidal silica and also containing an oxidizer and a polishing pad (S<b>12</b>′, steps (C) and (E)). In this manner, the oxidation step and the CMP step were performed at the same time. After CMP was finished, the substrate was washed with a solution containing HF (S<b>13</b>-<b>1</b>, step (D)). Then, the main surface was etched by 20 nm by RIE using oxygen and RIE using CF<sub>4</sub>. In this manner, the oxidation step by RIE using oxygen and the etching step were performed at the same time (S<b>13</b>′ steps (D) and (E)), and also the etching step by RIE using CF<sub>4 </sub>was performed. These steps were repeated. Next, the main surface of the substrate was etched with a solution containing HF (S<b>13</b>-<b>2</b>, step (D)), and then was rinsed with pure water. Another surface, which is not the main surface, may have a large Ra for releasing heat or may be a second main surface for epitaxial growth. This may be determined in accordance with the purpose. In the case where the another surface is the second main surface, after the first main surface is processed by the CMP step, the oxidation step and the etching step, the second main surface may processed in the same manner with the first main surface being masked with a resist.</div>

However, an area <b>43</b> enclosed by dashed circle shows a black striped portion. This is considered to be a hidden scratch. The part <b>42</b> does not show any striped portion, like in the part <b>42</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, in the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate produced by the production method in this embodiment, no striped hidden scratch was observed in the observation area. From this, it is seen that in this embodiment, a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate having few hidden scratches and allowing a quality silicon carbide semiconductor layer that has low defect density to be formed thereon is obtained. It is also seen that the method for inspecting a single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in this embodiment allows the hidden scratches to be observed and allows the quality of the single-crystal silicon carbide substrate to be evaluated based on the density of the hidden scratches.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Samples of single-crystal silicon carbide substrate in examples A through E and comparative examples A through F were produced. For producing these samples, the post-mechanical polishing surface roughness Ra and the CMP polishing amount t were different. The etching with CF<sub>4 </sub>in RIE (removal step) was performed for some samples and was not performed for the other samples, and the etching with O<sub>2 </sub>(oxidation step) was performed for some samples and was not performed for the other samples. The production conditions are shown in Table 1. The other conditions were the same as those in example 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The ratio of hidden scratches was found for the produced single-crystal silicon carbide substrates in examples A through E and comparative examples A through F. From each single-crystal silicon carbide substrate having a diameter of 100 mm, a peripheral area having a width of 2 mm was removed, and the rest was set as an effective area. In the effective area, 85 observation points were set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The mirror electron microscope was used to capture an image of the main surface of each single-crystal silicon carbide substrate at each observation point. The field of view of the mirror electron microscope had a diameter of 100 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">From the image captured at each observation point, presence/absence of a hidden scratch was confirmed. The number of the observation points at which the hidden scratch was detected was found. The number of the observation points at which the hidden scratch was detected were divided the total number of the observation points to find the ratio of hidden scratches. The results are shown in Table 1.</div>
