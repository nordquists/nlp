<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing composition used for polishing silicon wafers.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The surface of silicon wafers used as components in semiconductor products is commonly subjected to a lapping step (rough polishing step) and a polishing step (precision polishing step) to give a high-quality mirror surface. The polishing step typically includes a preliminary polishing step and a final polishing step. As the polishing method in the polishing step, chemical mechanical polishing using a polishing liquid containing a water-soluble polymer is known. By the method, adsorption and desorption of the water-soluble polymer to and from abrasives or silicon wafers contribute to a reduction in defects and haze of a polished surface. As a technical document on the composition for polishing silicon wafers, PTL 1 is exemplified. PTL 2 is a technical document on an abrasive used for polishing silicon dioxide.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">In recent years, semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers and other substrates have been required to have higher-quality surfaces. Accordingly, there is a demand for a polishing composition capable of yielding substrate surfaces with lower haze. From the viewpoint of the handleability, there is another demand for improvement in the filterability of a polishing composition. To this end, it is important to provide a polishing composition with the generation of agglomerates suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">The present invention therefore has an object to provide a silicon wafer polishing composition having excellent performances to reduce the haze of the surface of an object to be polished and having suppressed property of agglomeration (the property of particles contained in a polishing composition that agglomerate in the polishing composition).</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">According to the description, a composition for polishing silicon wafers used in the presence of abrasives is provided. This composition for polishing silicon wafers includes: a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator, an amido group-containing polymer A, an organic compound B not containing an amido group, and water. The amido group-containing polymer A has, on a main chain, a building block S derived from a monomer represented by General Formula (1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0021">In General Formula (1), R<sup>1 </sup>is a hydrogen atom; an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an aralkyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkoxyalkyl group, or an alkylol group having the number of carbon atoms of 1 to 6; an acetyl group; a phenyl group; a benzyl group; a chloro group; a difluoromethyl group; a trifluoromethyl group; or a cyano group. Of them, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having the number of carbon atoms of 1 to 6, and a phenyl group are preferred, a hydrogen atom and an alkyl group having the number of carbon atoms of 1 or 2 are more preferred, and a hydrogen atom is specifically preferred. X may be (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>. Here n is an integer of 4 to 6. X may be (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>or (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Of them, X is (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>preferably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0022">The monomer s disclosed here is exemplified by acryloylpiperidine, acryloylmorpholine, acryloylthiomorpholine, and acryloylpyrrolidine. The above-mentioned monomers s can be used singly or in combination of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0023">The amido group-containing polymer A is preferably nonionic. In other words, a polymer substantially containing no anionic building block or no cationic building block is preferred. Here, the substantially containing no anionic building block or no cationic building block means that the molar proportion of such a building block is less than 3% (for example, less than 1%, preferably less than 0.5%). By using the polishing composition containing the nonionic amido group-containing polymer, the effect of reducing defects and haze is favorably exerted. Although the reason is not necessarily revealed, it can be supposed that the nonionic amido group-containing polymer A appropriately adsorbs to abrasives and silicon wafers at the time of polishing and thus contributes to a reduction of haze. It can also be supposed that the appropriate adsorption suitably prevents abrasives and polishing waste in a cleaning step from remaining and contributes to a reduction of defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0024">The amido group-containing polymer A may have molecular weight (M<sub>A</sub>) that is larger than molecular weight (M<sub>B</sub>) of an organic compound B described later. For example, the molecular weight of the amido group-containing polymer A is typically less than 100×10<sup>4</sup>, preferably less than 80×10<sup>4</sup>, more preferably less than 50×10<sup>4</sup>, and even more preferably less than 45×10<sup>4 </sup>from the viewpoint of reducing the property of agglomeration and of improving the filterability, for example. In a preferred embodiment, the molecular weight of the amido group-containing polymer A may be less than 40×10<sup>4</sup>, and may be 35×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, for example. The molecular weight of the amido group-containing polymer A is typically 5×10<sup>3 </sup>or more, and is preferably 1×10<sup>4 </sup>or more and more preferably 5×10<sup>4 </sup>or more from the viewpoint of reducing haze, for example. From the viewpoint of improving the polishing rate, in a preferred embodiment, the molecular weight of the amido group-containing polymer A may be 10×10<sup>4 </sup>or more, and may be 15×10<sup>4 </sup>or more for example. As the molecular weight of amido group-containing polymers A, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (aqueous system, in terms of polyethyleneglycol) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0025">The relation between the weight average molecular weight Mw and the number average molecular weight Mn of the amido group-containing polymer A is not limited to particular values. For example, a polymer having a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 5.0 or less is preferably used from the viewpoint of reducing agglomeration property, for example. The Mw/Mn of the amido group-containing polymer A is preferably 4.0 or less, more preferably 3.5 or less, and even more preferably 3.0 or less (for example, 2.5 or less) from the viewpoint of performance stability of the polishing composition, for example. In principle, the Mw/Mn is 1.0 or more. Commonly, an amido group-containing polymer A having an Mw/Mn of 1.05 or more is preferably used from the viewpoint of easy availability of raw materials and synthetic easiness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0026">The amido group-containing polymer A disclosed here is preferably composed of substantially only the building block S. In other words, in the amido group-containing polymer A, the proportion of the mole number of the building block S relative to the mole number of all building blocks contained in the molecular structure of the polymer (molar proportion) is preferably 97% by mole or more (for example, 99% by mole or more, typically 99.5 to 100% by mole). Preferred examples of such a polymer include homopolymers containing a single type of the monomer s disclosed here and copolymers containing two or more types of the monomer s.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0027">The amido group-containing polymer A disclosed here may be a copolymer containing a building block derived from one or more types of a monomer t that is copolymerizable with the monomer s (hereinafter also called “building block T”) to such an extent as not to greatly impair effects of the invention. The building block T is defined as a different building block from the building block S. In the amido group-containing polymer A, the proportion (molar proportion) of the building block T can be less than 50% by mole (for example, less than 30% by mole, typically less than 10% by mole).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0028">The “% by mole” is a molar proportion calculated where a single building block derived from a single monomer (including the monomer s and the monomer t) is regarded as one molecule. Hence, the proportions of the building blocks S and T can correspond to the molar proportions of the monomer s and the monomer t, respectively, in all the monomer components used for polymerization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0029">&lt;Organic Compound B&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0030">A polishing composition disclosed here contains an organic compound B not containing an amido group, in addition to the amido group-containing polymer A as stated above. Preferably such an organic compound B typically has molecular weight (M<sub>B</sub>) of 200 or more. An organic compound having the number of carbon atoms of 5 or more (preferably 6 or more, and more preferably 10 or more) is preferably used for this. Any organic compound B satisfying such a condition can be used, which is not limited especially. Examples of such an organic compound B include surfactant and water-soluble polymer not containing an amido group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0031">As the surfactant not containing an amido group, an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant can be preferably adopted. From the viewpoint of low foaming properties and easy adjustment of pH, a nonionic surfactant is preferred. Examples of nonionic surfactants include oxyalkylene polymers such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and polytetramethylene glycol; polyoxyalkylene adducts such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylamines, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene glyceryl ether fatty acid esters, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters; and copolymers (diblock copolymers, triblock copolymers, random copolymers, alternating copolymers) of a plurality types of oxyalkylenes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0032">Specific examples of the nonionic surfactant include block copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) (diblock copolymers, polyethylene oxide (PEO)-polypropylene oxide (PPO)-PEO-type triblock copolymers, PPO-PEO-PPO-type triblock copolymers, for example), random copolymers of EO and PO, polyoxyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene propyl ether, polyoxyethylene butyl ether, polyoxyethylene pentyl ether, polyoxyethylene hexyl ether, polyoxyethylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene 2-ethylhexyl ether, polyoxyethylene nonyl ether, polyoxyethylene decyl ether, polyoxyethylene isodecyl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene isostearyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, polyoxyethylene phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene dodecyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene styrenated phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene laurylamine, polyoxyethylene stearylamine, polyoxyethylene oleylamine, polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polyoxyethylene monostearate, polyoxyethylene distearate, polyoxyethylene monooleate, polyoxyethylene dioleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitol tetraoleate, polyoxyethylene castor oil, and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil. As preferred surfactants of them, block copolymers of EO and PO (especially, PEO-PPO-PEO-type triblock copolymers), random copolymers of EO and PO, and polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (for example, polyoxyethylene decyl ether) are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0033">The water-soluble polymer not containing an amido group (hereinafter also called “optional polymer”) may be a polymer having, in the molecule, at least one functional group selected from cationic groups, anionic groups, and nonionic groups. For example, the optional polymer can be a polymer having, in the molecule, a hydroxy group, a carboxyl group, an acyloxy group, a sulfo group, a quaternary ammoniums structure, a heterocyclic structure, a vinyl structure, a polyoxyalkylene structure, or the like. A nonionic polymer is preferably adopted as the optional polymer from the viewpoint of reducing agglomeration property or improving cleanability, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0034">Preferred examples of the optional polymer in the polishing composition disclosed here include polymers containing an oxyalkylene unit, polymers containing a nitrogen atom, and vinyl alcohol polymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0035">Examples of the polymer containing an oxyalkylene unit include PEO, block copolymers of EO and PO, and random copolymers of EO and PO. The block copolymer of EO and PO can be diblock copolymers and triblock copolymers containing a PEO block and a PPO block, for example. Examples of the triblock copolymer include PEO-PPO-PEO-type triblock copolymers and PPO-PEO-PPO-type triblock copolymers. Commonly, a PEO-PPO-PEO-type triblock copolymer is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0036">In block copolymers or random copolymers of EO and PO, the molar proportion of EO and PO (EO/PO) constituting the copolymer is preferably more than 1, more preferably 2 or more, and even more preferably 3 or more (for example, 5 or more) from the viewpoint of solubility in water and cleanability, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0037">As the polymer containing a nitrogen atom, either a polymer containing a nitrogen atom on the main chain or a polymer having a nitrogen atom on a side chain functional group (pendant group) can be used. Examples of the polymer containing a nitrogen atom on the main chain include homopolymers and copolymers of an N-acyl alkyleneimine type monomer. Specific examples of the N-acyl alkyleneimine type monomer include N-acetylethyleneimine and N-propionylethyleneimine. Examples of the polymer having a nitrogen atom on a pendant group include polymers containing an N-vinyl type monomer unit. For example, homopolymers and copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone can be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0038">The vinyl alcohol polymer is typically a polymer containing a vinyl alcohol unit as a main repeating unit (PVA). In the polymer, the proportion of the mole number of a vinyl alcohol unit relative to the mole number of all repeating units is commonly 50% or more, preferably 65% or more, more preferably 70% or more, and, for example, 75% or more. Substantially all the repeating units may be composed of a vinyl alcohol unit. “Substantially” refers to that 95% or more of all repeating units are vinyl alcohol units. In PVA, the types of repeating units other than the vinyl alcohol unit is not limited to particular types, and can be one or more units selected from a vinyl acetate unit, a vinyl propionate unit, and a vinyl hexanoate unit, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0039">Other examples of the optional polymer that can be contained in the polishing composition disclosed here include cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose and pullulan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0040">In the polishing composition disclosed here, the molecular weight M<sub>A </sub>of the amido group-containing polymer A and the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>of the organic compound B have the relation satisfying 200≤MB&lt;M<sub>A</sub>. Such a relation of the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>of the organic compound B being less than the molecular weight M<sub>A </sub>of the amido group-containing polymer A leads to both of the performances of reducing haze and of reducing agglomeration property at a higher level. Reducing agglomeration property in the polishing composition is preferable because the filterability of the polishing composition can be improved. Although the reason for obtaining the property of reducing haze is not necessarily revealed, it can be supposed that the organic compound B having low molecular weight adsorbs to a silicon wafer densely so as to fill the gaps of the amido group-containing polymer A having high molecular weight at the time of polishing and thus contributes to a reduction of haze.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0041">From the viewpoint of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property, for example, the ratio (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>) of the molecular weight M<sub>A </sub>of the amido group-containing polymer A to the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>of the organic compound B is approximately (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥1.5, preferably (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥2, and more preferably (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)&gt;5. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio may be (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥7, or may be (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥10, for example. When the organic compound B is surfactant, the (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>) may be (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥30, (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥300 or (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≥500. The upper limit of (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>) is not limited especially, and (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≤5000 is preferable from the viewpoint of the performances of reducing haze, for example, and (M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)≤1000 is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0042">From the viewpoint of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property, for example, the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>of the organic compound B is typically 2×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, preferably 1.8×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, more preferably 1.5×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, and still more preferably 1.2×10<sup>4 </sup>or less. In a preferred embodiment, the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>of the organic compound B may be 1×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, and may be 9.5×10<sup>3 </sup>or less (typically 9×10<sup>3 </sup>or less), for example. For instance, when PEO-PPO-PEO-type triblock copolymer is used as the organic compound B, the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>is preferably 2×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, preferably less than 1×10<sup>4</sup>. For instance, when polyoxyethylene alkyl ether is used as the organic compound B, the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>is preferably 1×10<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 500 or less. For instance, when polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as the organic compound B, the molecular weight M<sub>B </sub>is preferably 2×10<sup>4 </sup>or less, preferably 1.25×10<sup>4 </sup>or less.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0045">The polishing composition disclosed here typically includes, in addition to the amido group-containing polymer A, water. As the water, ion-exchanged water (deionized water), pure water, ultrapure water, and distilled water can be preferably used, for example. In the water used, the total content of transition metal ions is preferably 100 ppb or less, for example, in order to avoid the inhibition of functions of other components contained in the polishing composition as much as possible. For example, the water purity can be increased by an ion exchange resin to remove impurity ions, by a filter to remove foreign substances, distillation, or similar operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0046">The polishing composition disclosed here may further contain an organic solvent homogeneously miscible with water (such as lower alcohols and lower ketones), as needed. Commonly, 90% by volume or more of the solvent contained in the polishing composition is preferably water, and 95% by volume or more (typically, 99 to 100% by volume) of the solvent is more preferably water.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0048">&lt;Abrasives&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0049">The polishing composition disclosed here is used in the presence of abrasives. The abrasives have a function of mechanically polishing the surface of silicon wafers. In the polishing composition disclosed here, the abrasives also have a function of rubbing the amido group-containing polymer A that has adsorbed to the surface of the abrasives against a silicon wafer or a function of removing the amido group-containing polymer A that has adsorbed to a silicon wafer. This adjusts the chemical polishing by a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator. The wording “polishing composition being used in the presence of abrasives” in the description covers the form of the polishing composition containing abrasives. Such a form can be understood as a favorable embodiment for the polishing composition disclosed here. Therefore, the wording “polishing composition being used in the presence of abrasives” can be replaced with the wording “polishing composition containing abrasives”. Alternatively abrasives may be used in the form of fixed abrasives encapsulated in a polishing pad, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0050">Materials of the abrasives disclosed here are not limited to particular materials and can be appropriately selected according to an intended purpose and a usage form of the polishing composition, for example. Examples of the abrasives include inorganic particles, organic particles, and organic-inorganic composite particles. Specific examples of the inorganic particles include oxide particles such as silica particles, alumina particles, cerium oxide particles, chromium oxide particles, titanium dioxide particles, zirconium oxide particles, magnesium oxide particles, manganese dioxide particles, zinc oxide particles, and colcothar particles; nitride particles such as silicon nitride particles and boron nitride particles; carbide particles such as silicon carbide particles and boron carbide particles; diamond particles; and carbonates such as calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. Specific examples of the organic particles include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particles, poly(meth)acrylic acid particles (here, the (meth)acrylic acid inclusively means acrylic acid and methacrylic acid), and polyacrylonitrile particles. Such abrasive grain types may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0051">The abrasives are preferably inorganic particles, and specifically preferably particles of a metal oxide or a metalloid oxide. The abrasives usable in the technique disclosed here are preferably exemplified by silica particles. The reason for this is as follows: When silica particles composed of oxygen atoms and the same element as an object to be polished (silicon wafer) are used as the abrasives, residues of a different metal or a different metalloid from silicon are not generated after polishing, and this eliminates the possibility of contamination of the surface of a silicon wafer or of deterioration of electrical properties as a silicon wafer due to diffusion of a different metal or a different metalloid from silicon in an object to be polished. As a preferred embodiment of the polishing composition from such a viewpoint, a polishing composition containing silica particles alone as the abrasives is exemplified. In addition, the silica has such characteristics that highly pure silica is easily available. This is also exemplified as the reason why the silica particles are preferred as the abrasives. Specific examples of the silica particles include colloidal silica, fumed silica, and precipitated silica. From the viewpoint that scratches are unlikely to be generated on the surface of an object to be polished and a surface having a lower haze can be achieved, preferred examples of the silica particles include colloidal silica and fumed silica. Of them, colloidal silica is preferred. Specifically, colloidal silica can be preferably adopted as the abrasives in a polishing composition used for polishing (especially, final polishing) of silicon wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0052">The silica constituting the silica particles preferably has a true specific gravity of 1.5 or more, more preferably 1.6 or more, and even more preferably 1.7 or more. Silica having a larger true specific gravity enables an improvement of polishing rate (the removal amount of the surface of an object to be polished per unit time) at the time of polishing of a silicon wafer. From the viewpoint of reducing scratches generated on the surface (polished face) of an object to be polished, silica particles having a true specific gravity of 2.2 or less are preferred. As the true specific gravity of silica, a measured value determined by a liquid displacement method using ethanol as the displacement liquid can be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0053">In the technique disclosed here, the abrasives included in the polishing composition may be in the form of primary particles or in the form of secondary particles formed by assembly of a plurality of primary particles. Abrasives in the form of primary particles may be mixed with abrasives in the form of secondary particles. In a preferred embodiment, at least some of the abrasives are contained in the form of secondary particles in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0054">The average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasives is not limited to particular values, but is preferably 5 nm or more and more preferably 10 nm or more from the viewpoint of polishing efficiency, for example. From the viewpoint of achieving higher polishing effect, the average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>is preferably 15 nm or more and more preferably 20 nm or more (for example, more than 20 nm). From the viewpoint of easily giving a more smoothing surface, the average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>is typically 100 nm or less appropriately, preferably 50 nm or less and more preferably 40 nm or less. From the viewpoint of giving a higher-quality surface and the like, the average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasives may be 35 nm or less (typically, less than 30 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0055">In the technique disclosed here, the average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>of abrasives can be, for example, calculated in accordance with the equation, average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>(nm)=2727/S where S is the specific surface area (m<sup>2</sup>/g) determined by the BET method. The specific surface area of abrasives can be determined by using a surface area analyzer, trade name “Flow Sorb II 2300” manufactured by Micromeritics, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0056">The average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>of the abrasives is preferably 10 nm or more and more preferably 20 nm or more from the viewpoint of polishing rate, for example. From the viewpoint of achieving higher polishing effect, the average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>is preferably 30 nm or more, more preferably 35 nm or more, and even more preferably 40 nm or more (for example, more than 40 nm). From the viewpoint of giving a more smoothing surface, the average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>of the abrasives is 200 nm or less appropriately, 150 nm or less preferably and 100 nm or less more preferably. From the viewpoint of giving a higher-quality surface, for example, the technique disclosed here can be embodied preferably when the abrasives are used having the average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>less than 70 nm (preferably 60 nm or less, e.g., less than 50 nm) as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0057">The average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>of abrasives can be determined by the following procedure. An aqueous dispersion liquid of intended abrasives is used as a measurement sample, and is subjected to dynamic light scattering by using a particle size distribution analyzer, model “UPA-UT151” manufactured by NIKKISO CO., LTD., for example. The concentration of abrasives in an aqueous dispersion liquid as the measurement sample is not limited to particular values, but from the viewpoint of measurement accuracy, the concentration of abrasives is preferably 0.5% by mass or less and more preferably 0.2% by mass or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0058">The average secondary particle size D<sub>P2 </sub>of abrasives is commonly equal to or more than the average primary particle size D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasives (D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>≥1) and is typically more than D<sub>P1 </sub>(D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>&gt;1). Although not critical, from the viewpoint of polishing effect and surface smoothness after polishing, the D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasives is commonly, appropriately in a range of 1.2 to 3, preferably in a range of 1.5 to 2.5, and more preferably in a range of 1.7 to 2.3 (for example, exceeding 1.8 and not more than 2.2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0059">The shape (outer shape) of the abrasives may be spherical or nonspherical. Specific examples of the shape of nonspherical abrasives include a peanut-like shape (or a peanut shell-like shape), a cocoon-like shape, a konpeito- (pointed sugar candy ball-) like shape, and a rugby ball-like shape. For example, abrasives in which many of the abrasives have a peanut-like shape can be preferably adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0060">The average of major axis length/minor axis length ratios (average aspect ratio) of primary particles of the abrasives is not limited to particular values, but is preferably 1.05 or more and more preferably 1.1 or more. When the abrasives have a larger average aspect ratio, a higher polishing rate can be achieved. The abrasives preferably has an average aspect ratio of 3.0 or less, more preferably 2.0 or less, and even more preferably 1.5 or less from the viewpoint of reducing scratches, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0061">The shape (outer shape) and the average aspect ratio of the abrasives can be determined by observation under an electron microscope, for example. Specific procedures for determining the average aspect ratio are as follows: For example, a predetermined number (for example, 200 pieces) of abrasives that can be identified to have independent particle shapes are observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a rectangle is circumscribed around each grain image so as to have a minimum area. The long side length (major axis length) of the rectangle circumscribing each grain image is divided by the short side length (minor axis length), and the calculated value is regarded as the major axis length/minor axis length ratio (aspect ratio). The arithmetic mean of the aspect ratios of the predetermined number of grains can be calculated to give the average aspect ratio.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0063">The polishing composition disclosed here typically includes, in addition to the amido group-containing polymer A, the organic compound B, and the water, a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator. The silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator added to the polishing composition is a component that has a function of chemically polishing a surface to be polished and contributes to an improvement of polishing rate. The silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator has a function of chemically etching silicon and is typically a basic compound. The basic compound contained in a polishing composition increases the pH of the polishing composition and improves the dispersion state of the abrasives or the amido group-containing polymer A. The basic compound thus can help the polishing composition to have higher dispersion stability and the abrasives to achieve higher mechanical polishing performance.</div>

When the polishing liquid has a pH of 12.0 or less (more preferably 11.0 or less), the abrasives (especially, silica particles such as colloidal silica, fumed silica, and precipitated silica) contained in the polishing liquid are prevented from dissolving due to a basic compound, and a reduction of the mechanical polishing performance of the abrasives can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0089">When the polishing composition disclosed here contains abrasives, the content of the abrasives in the concentrated liquid can be 50% by mass or less, for example. From the viewpoint of stability of the polishing composition (for example, dispersion stability of abrasives), filterability, and the like, the content of the abrasives in the concentrated liquid is commonly, preferably 45% by mass or less and more preferably 40% by mass or less. In a preferred embodiment, the content of the abrasives in the concentrated liquid may be 30% by mass or less and may be 20% by mass or less (for example, 15% by mass or less).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0090">The polishing composition disclosed here may be a one-pack type or a multi-pack type including a two-pack type. For example, the polishing composition can be composed in such a manner that liquid I containing some of the components of the polishing composition (for example, a dispersion liquid containing abrasives (such as silica particles), a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator, and water) is mixed with liquid II containing the remaining components (for example, a liquid containing an amido group-containing polymer A and an organic compound B), and the mixture is used for polishing an object to be polished. Alternatively abrasives prepared separately may be mixed at a predetermined timing with the polishing composition containing a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator, an amido group-containing polymer A, an organic compound B, and water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0091">&lt;Preparation of Polishing Composition&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0092">The production method of the polishing composition disclosed here is not limited to particular methods. For example, a well-known mixer such as a blade-type stirrer, an ultrasonic disperser, and a homomixer is used to mix components contained in the polishing composition. The manner of mixing these components is not limited to particular manners. For example, all the components may be concurrently mixed, or the components may be mixed in an appropriate order.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0094">The polishing composition disclosed here can be used for polishing an object to be polished in such a manner as to include the following operations, for example. A preferred embodiment of the method for polishing an object to be polished by using the polishing composition disclosed here will next be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0095">That is, a polishing liquid (typically, a polishing liquid in a slurry form, also called a polishing slurry) containing any of the polishing compositions disclosed here is prepared. The preparing a polishing liquid can include preparing a polishing liquid by subjecting a polishing composition to concentration adjustment (for example, dilution), pH adjustment, or other operations. Alternatively, the polishing composition may be used as the polishing liquid without any treatment. For a multi-pack type polishing composition, the preparing a polishing liquid can include mixing packed components, diluting one or a plurality of packed components before the mixing, and diluting the mixture after the mixing, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0096">Next, the polishing liquid is supplied to an object to be polished, and the object is polished in usual ways. For example, when a silicon wafer is subjected to final polishing, a silicon wafer that has been subjected to a lapping step and a preliminary polishing step is set to a common polishing apparatus, and the polishing liquid is supplied to a surface (face to be polished) of the silicon wafer through a polishing pad on the polishing apparatus. Typically, while the polishing liquid is continuously supplied, the polishing pad is pressed against the surface of the silicon wafer, and the polishing pad and the silicon wafer are relatively moved (for example, rotationally moved). Through the polishing step, the polishing of the object to be polished is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0097">The polishing pad used in the polishing step may be any polishing pad. For example, any of nonwoven fabric polishing pads, suede polishing pads, polishing pads containing abrasives and not containing abrasives can be used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0099">The object polished by using the polishing composition disclosed here that contain abrasives can be rinsed with a rinse solution that contains the same components as in the polishing composition but contains no abrasives. In other words, the method of polishing an object to be polished may include a step of rinsing the object to be polished by using a rinse solution that contains the same components as in the polishing composition but contains no abrasives (rinsing step). The rinsing step enables a reduction of residues such as abrasives that can cause surface defects or haze of an object to be polished. The rinsing step may be performed between a polishing step and another polishing step or may be performed after the final polishing step and before the cleaning step described later. Rinsing with the rinse solution that contains the same components as in the polishing composition but contains no abrasives enables a further reduction of defects or haze without impairing the function of the amido group-containing polymer A that has adsorbed onto the surface of a silicon wafer. Such a rinse solution can typically be a composition for polishing silicon wafers containing a silicon-wafer polishing removal accelerator, an amido group-containing polymer A, and water (specifically a composition used for rinsing a polished silicon wafer; also called a rinsing composition). The formulation and the like of the silicon wafer rinsing composition are basically the same as those of the above-mentioned composition for polishing silicon wafers except that no abrasives are contained, and the explanation is not repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0100">&lt;Cleaning&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0101">An object polished by using the polishing composition disclosed here is typically cleaned after polishing (after rinsing as needed). The cleaning can be performed by using an appropriate cleaning solution. The cleaning solution used may be any cleaning solution. For example, an SC-1 cleaning solution (a mixed solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and water (H<sub>2</sub>O); hereinafter, cleaning with the SC-1 cleaning solution is called “SC-1 cleaning”) or an SC-2 cleaning solution (a mixed solution of HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O), which are commonly used in the field of semiconductors and the like, can be used. The temperature of the cleaning solution is room temperature to about 90° C., for example. From the viewpoint of improving cleaning efficiency, a cleaning solution at about 50° C. to 85° C. can be preferably used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0133">&lt;Evaluation of Agglomeration Property&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0134">In order to evaluate the agglomeration property of a polishing composition, the agglomerating rate of the polishing composition was measured. The agglomerating rate of a polishing composition in the description is defined as the ratio of R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>) where R<sub>1 </sub>denotes the average particle size of the particles in the polishing composition and R<sub>2 </sub>denotes the average particle size of the abrasives in a comparison composition described later. A smaller agglomerating rate means lower agglomeration property of the polishing composition. The following specifically describes a method of measuring the agglomerating rate of a polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0135">The polishing composition was used as a measurement sample and the average particle size (volume average particle size) R<sub>1 </sub>of the particles in the polishing composition was measured by an analyzer, model “UPA-UT151” manufactured by NIKKISO CO., LTD on the basis of dynamic light scattering (the same apparatus was used for the measurement of R<sub>2</sub>). Next, a comparison composition was prepared by weighing the abrasives, the ammonia water and the deionized water used to produce the polishing compositions as stated above so that their contents agreed with those in the polishing compositions and mixing. Specifically the comparison composition was prepared in the same manner as in the method for manufacturing the polishing composition except that the water-soluble polymer and the organic compound were not used. The comparison composition obtained was used as a measurement sample and the average particle size (volume average particle size) R<sub>2 </sub>of the particles in the comparison composition was measured on the basis of dynamic light scattering. As a result, all of the abrasives in the comparison compositions of Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 had the average particle size R<sub>2 </sub>of 57 nm, and the abrasives in the comparison compositions of Example 5 had the average particle size R<sub>2 </sub>of 42 nm. R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2 </sub>was calculated from the obtained values of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>, so as to determine the agglomerating rates of the polishing compositions. Table 1 illustrates R<sub>1 </sub>of the polishing compositions of these examples and their agglomerating rates.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0137">As illustrated in Table 1, the polishing compositions of Examples 1 to 5 containing the combination of PACMO having high molecular weight and organic compounds having low molecular weight had both of the performance of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property at a high level. Among them, Examples 1, 2, 4 and 5 containing the organic compounds having an Mw less than 1×10<sup>4 </sup>had a more excellent effect of reducing haze. The polishing compositions of Examples 1, 4 and 5 containing PACMO having an Mw of 33×10<sup>4 </sup>and PEO-PPO-PEO having an Mw of 9000 had both of more excellent performance of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property. On the contrary, both of the polishing compositions of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 containing PACMO singly were not enough in the performance of reducing haze. The polishing composition of Comparative Example 3 containing the combination of HEC having high molecular weight and PEO-PPO-PEO (organic compound) having low molecular weight led to a reduction in haze as compared with Comparative Examples 1 and 2, but had high agglomeration property, and so was not enough in balance between these performances. The polishing composition of Comparative Example 4 containing the combination of PACMO having low molecular weight and EOPO random copolymer (organic compound) having high molecular weight was poor in both of the performances of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property. These results indicate that the combination of an amido group-containing polymer having high molecular weight and an organic compound having low molecular weight can achieve a good balance in the performances of reducing haze and reducing agglomeration property.</div>
