<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a polishing composition for polishing a silicon wafer, and a polishing method using the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, multi-stage polishing has been performed generally in the polishing of a silicon wafer. More specifically, the following multi-stage polishing has been performed: a silicon wafer is flattened in the primary polishing, and the surface of the silicon wafer is finished more finely in the secondary polishing and subsequent stages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the primary polishing, a high polishing rate is required and flatness of a silicon wafer is demanded. The conventional polishing composition for the primary polishing contains abrasives in order to improve the polishing rate. As the abrasives, nanometer-order colloidal particles or the like are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, as the required accuracy regarding wafer quality increases, the prevention and countermeasure to scratches and LPDs (light point defects) come to be needed in the primary polishing as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The mechanical polishing with a polishing composition containing abrasives makes it possible to achieve a high polishing rate, but at the same time, it can be a factor that causes scratches and LPDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In considering how to suppress the generation of scratches and reduce LPDs, abrasives have attracted attention, and an abrasive-free polishing composition A for polishing a silicon wafer has been known (Patent Document 1). This polishing composition A is composed of an alkaline aqueous solution that contains a water-soluble silicic acid component and an alkaline component and has a pH of 8.5 to 13.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">This polishing composition A is used in a polishing process performed after the polishing of a silicon wafer with a polishing composition B that contains abrasives. In other words, in the two-stage polishing with respect to a silicon wafer, the polishing composition A is used in the latter stage thereof. Therefore, the polishing with a substantially abrasive-free polishing composition has not been realized yet. Further, as a high polishing pressure of about 300 gf/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is used generally, is required in order to achieve a higher polishing rate, problems arise such as an increase in scratches, and wafer deformation such as edge roll-off. Still further, the polishing under a high polishing pressure involves an increase in the polishing temperature, which causes the reaction of chemical components to increase locally. This leads to problems in the flatness, such as irregularities in the wafer inplane thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, in the multi-stage polishing of a silicon wafer, major challenges in the polishing in latter stages are the elimination and reduction of roughness on the smaller levels, scratches, nanometer-order defects, and LPDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Document 1: JP9(1997)-306881A</div>
<heading id="h-0004">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the primary polishing of a silicon wafer, however, if the polishing is carried out with a composition without abrasives, mechanical polishing effects degrade generally, which leads to a problem of a decrease in the polishing rate. Besides, there is a problem that Haze and LPDs vary significantly in polished wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention, therefore, was made in order to address such problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a polishing composition that does not contain abrasives and that allows a polishing rate applicable to the primary polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the present invention is to provide a polishing method using a polishing composition that does not contain abrasives and that allows a polishing rate applicable to the primary polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, the polishing composition is a polishing composition that does not contain abrasives and that is used for polishing a silicon wafer, and the polishing composition contains a polishing accelerator, a water-soluble polymer, and a block-type compound in which an oxyethylene group and an oxypropylene group are included in a block-type polyether. The polishing accelerator includes an amine compound or an inorganic alkaline compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, according to the present invention, the polishing method is a polishing method for polishing a silicon wafer using the polishing composition according to claim <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the polishing composition is a polishing composition that does not contain abrasives and that is used for polishing a silicon wafer, and the polishing composition contains a polishing accelerator, a water-soluble polymer, and a block-type compound. As a result, when a silicon wafer is polished with the polishing composition, a polishing speed of greater than 0.1 μm/min can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the effects of the water-soluble polymer and the block-type compound can reduce Haze and LPDs. Particularly, the block-type compound has a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic group in one polymer chain, and has a smaller molecular weight as compared with coexistent water-soluble polymers, thereby having a smaller steric size in a molecular chain and in a solution. The block-type compound, therefore, adsorbs to a surface of a silicon wafer at a higher adsorption rate and is unlikely to cause steric hindrance, thereby being able to bond to a surface of a silicon wafer at a high density. Further, regarding a block copolymer having a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic group, a surface of a silicon wafer immediately after polishing, that is, highly reactive silicon, quickly forms a bond with a hydrophilic group of the block copolymer; and in contrast, the hydrophobic portion thereof can be positioned on the surface of the silicon wafer after the molecule chain adsorbs thereto, so as to prevent foreign materials present under the polishing environments from adsorbing thereto. Still further, a water-soluble polymer forms a steric polymer chain that includes a water molecule via a hydrogen bond, thereby being able to keep the surface of the silicon wafer hydrophilic. As the water-soluble polymer and the block-type compound both are included, better effects can be achieved as compared with the case where either of the foregoing two is used alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, the polishing composition according to the embodiment of the present invention can be applied to the primary polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that in an embodiment of the present invention, the compound where an oxyethylene group and an oxypropylene group are included in the block-type polyether is referred to as a “block-type compound”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The polishing composition COMP1 is used for polishing a silicon wafer having a oxide layer formed on surfaces thereof, that is, for primary polishing of a silicon wafer. Further, the polishing composition COMP1 is used for single-side polishing of a silicon wafer, or for double-side polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The pH buffer contains, for example, a carbonate and a hydrogencarbonate. With regard to the buffering effects, the carbonate and the hydrogencarbonate may be mixed when used, or each may be used alone. The carbonate is formed with a carbonate of a monovalent ion such as an alkali metal element; for example, it is formed with any one of potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate. Further, examples of the carbonate include the following: carbonates of a bivalent metal ion such as alkali earth metal elements; and carbonates formed with a nitrogen group and an organic compound, such as ammonium salts and amine carbonate salts. Examples of the amine carbonate salt include guanidine carbonate salts, aminoguanidine bicarbonate salts, and biguanide carbonate salts. Further, examples of the hydrogencarbonate, like the carbonate, include salts of inorganic compounds and organic compounds, such as salts of alkali and alkali earth metals, ammonium salts, and salts of amine compounds. For example, a hydrogencarbonate compound of a monovalent alkali metal is formed with either one of potassium hydrogencarbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The pH buffer includes a carbonate and a hydrogencarbonate. The carbonate is formed with a carbonate of a monovalent ion, for example, either one of potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate. The hydrogencarbonate is formed with a hydrogencarbonate of a monovalent ion, for example, either one of potassium hydrogencarbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The polishing accelerator is formed with an amine compound or an inorganic alkaline compound. In the embodiment of the present invention, the amine compound encompasses primary amine to quaternary amine that include nitrogen groups. The amine compound is formed with an amine having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol. This is because an amine having more than 6 carbon atoms causes the polishing accelerator to have a lower ability for forming a complex with silicon, thereby causing effects per unit concentration to degrade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The inorganic alkaline compound is formed with, for example, potassium hydroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The water-soluble polymer is formed with a polymer compound having a cellulose structure, for example, hydroxyethyl cellulose. Further, the water-soluble polymer is formed with a nonionic polymer compound, for example, any one of polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and polyethylene oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The block-type compound is formed with a block-type compound in which an oxyethylene group and an oxypropylene group have hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in one polymer chain of block-type polyether; for example, it is formed with ethylene diamine tetrapolyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The polishing composition COMP1 is produced by appropriately mixing the pH buffer, the polishing accelerator, the water-soluble polymer, and the block-type compound, and then, adding water thereto. Alternatively, the polishing composition COMP1 is produced by sequentially mixing the following into water: the pH buffer; the polishing accelerator; the water-soluble polymer; and the block-type compound. As a means for mixing these components, a means normally used in the technical field of the polishing composition, such as a homogenizer and ultrasonic wave, are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Resulting from that the polishing composition COMP1 contains the above-described pH buffer, the polishing composition COMP1 is controlled to have a pH of 10.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiment of the present invention, the polishing composition COMP1 may further contain a chelating agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The chelating agent is formed with any one of the following: ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA); hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine triacetic acid (HEDTA); diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA); nitrilo triacetic acid (NTA); triethylene tetramine hexaacetic acid (TTHA); hydroxyethyl imino diacetic acid (HIDA); dihydroxy ethyl glycine (DHEG); ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethylether) tetraacetic acid (EGTA); and 1,2-cyclohexane diamine tetraacetic acid (CDTA). Further, the chelating agent is formed with at least one type of a chemical compound, selected from the group consisting of substituents and derivatives of these compounds. Still further, the chelating agent may be formed with an organic acid, for example, any one of the following: potassium sodium tartrate; potassium tartrate; citric acid; trisodium citrate; monosodium citrate; tripotassium citrate; lactic acid; and DL-malic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The chelating agent prevents a silicon wafer to be polished from being contaminated by metals. Further, the chelating agent only contributes to the prevention of metal contamination, and basically does not influence the improvement of the polishing rate, the surface roughness of a silicon wafer, etc. However, the pH of the polishing composition varies with the concentration of the chelating agent. The chelating agent, therefore, functions as a pH adjuster in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in detail by way of examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Components of a polishing composition and a polishing rate in Example 1 are shown in Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Using a polishing device (DSM20B-5P-4D) (manufactured by SpeedFam Co., Ltd.), double-side polishing was performed in the following manner: while 25-fold dilution of the polishing composition of Example 1 was supplied at a rate of 5.0 liter/min to a polishing pad (urethane pad (manufactured by Nitta Haas Incorporation)) and a pressure of 175 (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied to a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm, the upper platen and the lower platen of the polishing platens were rotated at rotation speeds of −11.9 rpm and 35.0 rpm, respectively, and the carrier was rotated at a rotation speed of −8.3 rpm. This double-side polishing was performed for 30 to 120 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">After the polishing completed, a decrease in the thickness of the silicon wafer through removal by the polishing was measured by “NANOMETRO 300TT”, a wafer flatness measurement device manufactured by Kuroda Precision Industries.
