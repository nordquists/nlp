<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Polishing compositions (especially polishing compositions for precision polishing) for polishing semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers as well as other substrates are expected to have abilities to produce surfaces with low haze and a fewer number of micro particles (light point defect or LPD) after polishing. Many of polishing compositions for such purposes comprise, besides water and an abrasive, a water-soluble polymer for protecting the surface of a polishing object (an article to be polished, or work piece) or increasing the wettability, etc. of the same. Among them, hydroxyethyl cellulose is cited as a widely used, water-soluble polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is a polymer derived from a natural compound (cellulose), there are limitations in managing the chemical structure and purity as compared with a polymer obtainable by artificial polymerization of monomers (i.e. a synthetic polymer). For instance, commercially readily available HECs are limited in weight average molecular weight and range of molecular weight distribution (ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn), i.e. Mw/Mn). In addition, since they are derived from natural compounds, it is difficult to significantly reduce impurities and local disorder (microscale aggregation, etc.) in their polymer structures, etc., that may cause surface defect. The amounts and extent of such impurities, etc., are likely to vary widely as well. As more strict requirements are expected for surface quality in the future, it will be useful to provide a polishing composition excellent in reducing the number of LPD and haze, with the composition not essentially requiring an HEC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of such circumstances, an objective of the present invention is to provide a polishing composition excellent in reducing the number of LPD and haze. Another related objective is to provide a method for producing a polished article, using such a polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">A typical polishing composition for polishing semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers and other substrates comprises an abrasive, water, and a water-soluble polymer, and further comprises a basic compound to adjust the pH to a basic pH. It is preferable to adjust the polishing composition to a basic pH from the standpoint of stabilizing the dispersion of the abrasive and increasing the polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Some water-soluble polymers, however, undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. When a water-soluble polymer in a polishing composition is hydrolyzed, the polishing composition may suffer performance deterioration over time. Thus, in a polishing composition adjusted to a basic pH (or a “basic polishing composition” hereinafter), the use of a water-soluble polymer that is hydrolytic under basic conditions (alkaline-hydrolytic water-soluble polymer) has been avoided to inconveniently limit the choice of compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In a basic polishing composition, it will be useful to improve the performance stability while using an alkaline-hydrolytic water-soluble polymer. Thus, another objective of the present invention is to provide a technique that uses a water-soluble polymer having an alkaline-hydrolytic functional group to produce a basic polishing composition with greater performance stability</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The polishing composition according to a first aspect provided by this specification comprises a water-soluble polymer having a molecular structure including a plurality of repeat unit species with different SP (solubility parameter) values. In the water-soluble polymer, the plurality of repeat unit species comprise a repeat unit A having an SP value of 14.5 or higher and a repeat unit B having an SP value of lower than 14.5. The water-soluble polymer has an average SP value of 17.5 or lower determined by multiplying the SP value of each repeat unit species by the total volume fraction of the repeat unit species relative to the combined volume of all the repeat unit species in the molecular structure; and summing the results of the multiplication of all the repeat unit species in the molecular structure. Herein, the total volume of each repeat unit species is determined as the results of the number of moles of the repeat unit multiplied by its molar volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">A polishing composition comprising such a water-soluble polymer may have a greater ability to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in a polished surface when compared with, for instance, a polishing composition in which the water-soluble polymer is replaced with the same amount of hydroxyethyl cellulose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">When used for polishing a polishing object, the polishing composition disclosed herein typically comprises an abrasive in addition to the water-soluble polymer. According to the polishing composition in such an embodiment, the mechanical work of the abrasive can increase the polishing efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">As the water-soluble polymer, a nonionic polymer can be preferably used. According to the polishing composition comprising a nonionic water-soluble polymer that satisfies the average SP value with the repeat units A and B individually satisfying the aforementioned SP values, it is possible to bring about greater effect to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface.</div>

A polishing composition comprising such a water-soluble polymer can bring about greater effect to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Another preferable example of the water-soluble polymer comprises a vinyl acetate unit as the repeat unit B. Herein, the vinyl acetate unit refers to the structural moiety corresponding to the structure formed by polymerization of the vinyl group of vinyl acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH═CH<sub>2</sub>). The vinyl acetate unit is the structural moiety represented by the chemical formula —CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OCOCH<sub>3</sub>)— (SP value 11.1). A polishing composition comprising such a water-soluble polymer can bring about greater effect to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">When the water-soluble polymer comprises a vinyl acetate unit, the molar ratio (ratio of the number of moles) of the vinyl acetate unit to the total number of moles of all the repeat units in the molecular structure of the water-soluble polymer is preferably in a range between 5% and 80%. A polishing composition comprising such a water-soluble polymer can bring about greater effect to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface.</div>

The method comprises supplying a polishing liquid (the term “liquid” herein encompasses a slurry) to a polishing object (work piece). It further comprises polishing a surface of the polishing object with the polishing liquid. According to such a production method, a polished article comprising a high-quality surface (e.g. with fewer LPD and low haze) can be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The art disclosed herein can be preferably applied to polishing a silicon wafer, for instance, a lapped silicon wafer. An example of particularly preferable applications is final polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>

<br/>
Abrasive adsorption (%)=[(C0−C1)/C0]×100
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">A polishing composition that satisfies the etching rate and abrasive adsorption can reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface when compared with a polishing composition that does not satisfy the etching rate and/or the abrasive adsorption. For instance, the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface can be reduced in comparison to a polishing composition using hydroxyethyl cellulose as the water-soluble polymer (i.e., the polishing composition typically having an abrasive adsorption of greater than 20%).</div>

Herein, the vinyl alcohol unit refers to the structural moiety corresponding to the structure formed by polymerization of the vinyl group of vinyl alcohol (CH<sub>2</sub>═CH—OH). In particular, the vinyl alcohol unit is the structural moiety represented by the chemical formula —CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OH)—. The vinyl acetate unit is as described earlier. It is particularly meaningful to produce a polishing composition comprising such a water-soluble polymer H by applying the method disclosed herein because its properties, and consequently its polishing abilities, are likely to be altered by hydrolysis of the acyloxy group.</div>

An example of such a water-soluble polymer has a structure resulting from partial saponification of vinyl hexanoate homopolymer or copolymer.

According to the polishing composition that comprises a nonionic water-soluble polymer that has repeat units A and B satisfying the aforementioned SP values while satisfying the average SP value, it is possible to obtain greater effect to reduce the haze and the number of LPD in the polished surface. The water-soluble polymer being nonionic is preferable also from the standpoint of reducing aggregates and increasing the washability, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer is not particularly limited.

On the other hand, in general, with increasing Mw of water-soluble polymer, the haze reduction effect tends to increase. From such a standpoint, it is usually preferable to use a water-soluble polymer having a Mw of 0.1×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger (typically 0.2×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger, e.g. 1×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In the polishing composition according to the first aspect disclosed herein, a water-soluble polymer having a Mw of 3×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller can be preferably used.

The Mw of the water-soluble polymer is typically 0.1×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger, or usually preferably 0.2×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger. The Mw range can be preferably applied to, for instance, a water-soluble polymer comprising a vinyl alcohol unit as the repeat unit A (e.g. a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The relationship between the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn) of the water-soluble polymer is not particularly limited.

From the standpoint of the performance stability of the polishing composition, etc., the water-soluble polymer has an Mw/Mn of preferably 4.0 or less, more preferably 3.5 or less, or yet more preferably 3.0 or less (e.g. 2.5 or less).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The polishing composition disclosed herein typically comprises an abrasive. The material and properties of the abrasive in the polishing composition disclosed herein are not particularly limited and can be suitably selected in accordance with the purpose and application of the polishing composition, etc. Examples of the abrasive include inorganic grains, organic grains and organic/inorganic composite grains. Specific examples of inorganic grains include oxide grains such as silica grains, alumina grains, cerium oxide grains, chromium oxide grains, titanium dioxide grains, zirconium oxide grains, magnesium oxide grains, manganese dioxide grains, zinc oxide grains, red oxide grains, etc.; nitride grains such as silicon nitride grains, boron nitride grains, etc.; carbide grains such as silicon carbide grains, boron carbide grains, etc.; diamond grains; carbonates such as calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, etc.; and the like. Specific examples of organic grains include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grains, poly(meth)acrylic acid grains (herein the (meth)acrylic acid comprehensively means acrylic acid and methacrylic acid), polyacrylonitrile grains, and the like. These abrasives can be used singly as one species or in a combination of two or more species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">As the abrasive, inorganic grains are preferable. In particular, grains of an oxide of a metal or metalloid are preferable. Preferable examples of the abrasive that can be used in the art disclosed herein include silica grains. For instance, the use of silica grains as the abrasive is particularly preferable when applying the art disclosed herein to a polishing composition that can be used for polishing a silicon wafer. This is because when the polished article is a silicon wafer, the use of silica grains formed of oxygen atoms and the same element as the polished article will not leave metal or metalloid residues that are not silicon after the polishing, eliminating risks such as contamination of the silicon wafer surface and degradation of electrical properties of the silicon wafer caused by dispersion of metal or metalloid residues that are not silicon in the polished article. In addition, because silicon and silica are similar in hardness, polishing can be performed on a silicon wafer surface without causing excessive damage. An example of an embodiment of the polishing composition preferable from such a standpoint is a polishing composition comprising the abrasive consisting of silica grains. By nature, silica can be readily obtained in a highly pure state. This is also one of the reasons that silica grains are preferable as the abrasive. Specific examples of silica grains include colloidal silica, fumed silica, precipitated silica and the like. From the standpoint of the less likelihood of scratching the polishing object surface and capability of making a surface with lower haze, colloidal silica and fumed silica are cited as preferable silica grains. Colloidal silica is particularly preferable.

From the standpoint of the likelihood of yielding a highly smooth surface, the abrasive has an average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>of preferably 100 nm or smaller, more preferably 50 nm or smaller, or yet more preferably 40 nm or smaller.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In the art disclosed herein, the abrasive's average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>can be determined, for instance, from the specific surface area S (m<sup>2</sup>/g) measured by the BET method, based on the equation for the average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>(nm)=2727/S. The abrasive's specific surface area can be measured by using, for instance, a surface area analyzer under trade name “FLOW SORB II 2300” available from Micromeritics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>of the abrasive is not particularly limited.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The abrasive's average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>is generally equal to or larger than the abrasive's average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>(D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>≥1) and is typically larger than D<sub>P1 </sub>(D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>&gt;1). Although not particularly limited, from the standpoint of the effects of polishing and post-polishing surface smoothness, D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasive is usually suitably in a range of 1.2 to 3, preferably in a range of 1.5 to 2.5, or more preferably in a range of 1.7 to 2.3 (e.g. 1.8 or greater, but 2.2 or less).</div>

From the standpoint of scratch reduction and so on, the abrasive's average aspect ratio is preferably 3.0 or lower, more preferably 2.0 or lower, or yet more preferably 1.5 or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The abrasive's shape (external shape) and average aspect ratio can be assessed, for instance by electron microscope observations. In specific procedures for determining the average aspect ratio, for instance, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), with respect to a prescribed number (e.g. 200) of abrasive grains having observable separate shapes, the smallest circumscribing rectangles are drawn on the respective grain images. With respect to the rectangle drawn on each grain image, the long side length (major axis length) is divided by the short side length (minor axis length) to determine the major axis/minor axis ratio (aspect ratio). The aspect ratios of the prescribed number of grains can be arithmetically averaged to determine the average aspect ratio.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In such a basic abrasive dispersion where the abrasive and basic compound are co-present, the abrasive exhibits greater electrostatic repulsion due to the basic compound and thus shows higher dispersion stability than a basic compound-free abrasive dispersion (typically almost neutral).

According to such a mixing method, local aggregation of the abrasive can be better prevented, for instance, as compared with a mixing method where the basic abrasive dispersion is added to the aqueous polymer solution.

The pH of the basic abrasive dispersion is preferably 12 or lower, more preferably 11.5 or lower, or yet more preferably 10.5 or lower. With the pH of the basic abrasive dispersion being lower in a pH range of 7 or higher, the amount of the basic compound required for preparing the dispersion is reduced, making it easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition.

The pH of the aqueous polymer solution is adjusted preferably to around neutral to basic, or more preferably to basic. More specifically, the pH of the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 8 or higher, or more preferably 9 or higher. The pH can be adjusted by using some of the basic compound forming the polishing composition. The increased pH of the aqueous polymer solution can more greatly reduce local aggregation of the abrasive when the aqueous polymer solution is added to the basic abrasive dispersion. The pH of the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 12 or lower, or more preferably 10.5 or lower. With decreasing pH of the aqueous polymer solution, the amount of the basic compound required for preparing the aqueous polymer solution is reduced, making it easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition. For instance, when the abrasive is silica grains, it is advantageous that the pH is not excessively high also from the standpoint of reducing dissolution of the silica.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The abrasive adsorption is determined as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">(1B) The polishing composition is centrifuged to precipitate the abrasive and the resulting supernatant is subjected to measurement of total organic carbon to determine the total amount of organic carbon, C1, in the supernatant.</div>

<br/>
Abrasive adsorption (%)=[(C0−C1)/C0]×100
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">The abrasive adsorption being 20% or lower means that most (typically more than 80% by mass) of the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition is not adsorbed on the abrasive. The water-soluble polymer not adsorbed on the abrasive (or free polymer hereinafter) can adhere quickly to the polishing object surface and thus may be highly protective to the surface in comparison with the polymer adsorbed on the abrasive. Accordingly, in polishing with a polishing composition having a higher free polymer content (a low abrasive adsorption), the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition can serve more effectively to protect the surface of the polishing object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">On the other hand, the ability of the water-soluble polymer to protect the polishing object surface may vary also in accordance with the characteristics of the water-soluble polymer. The etching rate can serve as an index to evaluate the ability of the water-soluble polymer to protect the polishing object surface from alkaline corrosion under conditions not influenced by the mechanical force of the abrasive. A lower etching rate tends to indicate a greater ability to inhibit adsorption of the water-soluble polymer to the polishing object surface to causes the basic compound, etc., to chemically etch the surface, that is, a greater ability to protect the polishing object surface. The polishing composition disclosed herein comprises a surface-protective water-soluble polymer yielding an etching rate of a prescribed value or lower. In other words, most of the water-soluble polymer is present as free polymer in the liquid phase and some is adsorbed to the abrasive to suitably exhibit the effect to reduce the haze in the polishing object surface. Because of the low abrasive adsorption, aggregates of the abrasive and water-soluble polymer are unlikely to be formed. This is thought to advantageously contribute to reduce the number of LPD and increase the ease of filtration of the polishing compound.</div>

The water-soluble polymer H typically has a ratio of the number of moles (molar ratio) of hydrolytic group-containing repeat units to the number of moles of all repeat units in the molecular structure exceeds 2%. In producing such a polishing composition, a great effect can be obtained by the use of the method disclosed herein. An object (product) to which the method disclosed herein is preferably applied is a polishing composition that comprises a water-soluble polymer H having a molar ratio of a hydrolytic group of 5% or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">The polishing composition production method disclosed herein can be preferably implemented in an embodiment using a water-soluble polymer H having an ester group as the alkaline-hydrolytic functional group. Examples of the ester group-containing water-soluble polymer H include homopolymers and copolymers of a vinyl carboxylate and a (meth)acrylic acid ester as well as modification products (e.g. saponification products) of these, and the like. Specific examples of the vinyl carboxylate include vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl lactate, etc. Specific examples of the (meth)acrylic acid ester include methyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, etc. Upon hydrolysis of such ester group-containing water-soluble polymers H, for example, polyvinyl carboxylate is converted to a polymer having a polyol main chain while poly(meth)acrylic acid ester is converted to a poly(meth)acrylic acid.</div>

Herein, R is a primary organic group and preferably a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In particular, such a structural moiety is represented by the formula —CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OCOR)—. Typical examples of the vinyl carboxylate unit include vinyl acetate unit (structural moiety represented by the formula —CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OCOCH<sub>3</sub>)—) resulting from polymerization of the vinyl group in vinyl acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH═CH<sub>2</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">The water-soluble polymer H comprises a total of more than 2% by mole of one, two or more species of repeat unit (e.g. vinyl carboxylate unit) having a hydrolytic group, more preferably 5% by mole or greater (at a molar ratio of 5% or higher), or yet more preferably 10% by mole or greater. From the standpoint of obtaining greater application effect of the production method disclosed herein, a water-soluble polymer having a molar ratio of hydrolytic group-containing repeat unit of 15% or higher (or even 20% or higher) can be preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">The upper limit of molar ratio of the hydrolytic group-containing repeat unit in the water-soluble polymer H is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of the water solubility of the water-soluble polymer H, it is typically 80% or lower, usually preferably 60% or lower, more preferably 50% or lower, or yet more preferably 40% or lower (e.g. 30% or lower).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">A preferable example of the water-soluble polymer H is a saponification product of a vinyl acetate homopolymer or copolymer. A particularly preferable water-soluble polymer H is the saponification product of a vinyl acetate homopolymer. Such a water-soluble polymer H can be thought as a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol comprising vinyl acetate units (—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OCOCH<sub>3</sub>)—) and vinyl alcohol units (—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OH)—) formed by saponification of the vinyl acetate units at a ratio (molar ratio) corresponding to the degree of saponification. Such a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol may have a degree of saponification of typically higher than 2% by mole, usually 5% by mole or higher, preferably 10% by mole or higher, or more preferably 15% by mole or higher (e.g. 20% by mole or higher). The degree of saponification of the partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol is typically 80% by mole or lower, usually 60% by mole or lower, preferably 50% by mole or lower, or more preferably 40% by mole or lower (e.g. 30% by mole or lower).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">The molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer is not particularly limited. For instance, a water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 200×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller (typically 1×10<sup>4 </sup>to 200×10<sup>4</sup>, e.g. 1×10<sup>4 </sup>to 150×10<sup>4</sup>) can be used. From the standpoint of better preventing formation of aggregates, the use of a water-soluble polymer having a Mw of smaller than 100×10<sup>4 </sup>(more preferably 80×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, yet more preferably 50×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, typically 40×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, e.g. 30×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller) is preferable. From the standpoint of the ease of filtering and washing the resulting polishing composition, etc., a water-soluble polymer having a Mw of 25×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller (typically 20×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, more preferably 15×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, typically 10×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller, e.g. 5×10<sup>4 </sup>or smaller) can be preferably used. On the other hand, in general, with increasing Mw of water-soluble polymer, the haze reduction effect tends to increase. From such a standpoint, it is usually preferable to use a water-soluble polymer having a Mw of 1×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">In the art disclosed herein, the relationship between the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn) of the water-soluble polymer is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of preventing formation of aggregates, etc., for instance, a species having a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 5.0 or less can be preferably used. From the standpoint of the performance stability of the polishing composition, the water-soluble polymer's Mw/Mn is preferably 4.0 or less, more preferably 3.5 or less, or yet more preferably 3.0 or less (e.g. 2.5 or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">Theoretically, the Mw/Mn is 1.0 or greater. From the standpoint of the availability of starting materials and the ease of synthesis, in usual, a water-soluble polymer having an Mw/Mn of 1.05 or greater can be preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">As the Mw and Mn of a water-soluble polymer, the values (aqueous, based on standard polyethylene oxide) based on aqueous gel permeation chromatography (GPC) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">The water-soluble polymer is preferably nonionic. In other words, a water-soluble polymer H essentially free of anionic and cationic repeat units is preferable. Herein, being essentially free of anionic and cationic repeat units means that the molar ratio of these repeat units is lower than 0.02% (e.g. lower than 0.001%). According to the polishing composition that comprises a nonionic water-soluble polymer H that has repeat units A and B satisfying the aforementioned SP values while satisfying the average SP value, it is possible to obtain greater effect to reduce the haze value and the number of LPD in the polished surface. The water-soluble polymer H being nonionic is preferable also from the standpoint of reducing aggregates and increasing the washability, etc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">The polishing composition production method according to the first aspect disclosed herein is implemented, using an abrasive, a basic compound, a water-soluble polymer H and water as described earlier. The production method is characterized by comprising a step of obtaining an agent A comprising at least the basic compound, a step of obtaining an agent B comprising at least the water-soluble polymer H, and further comprising a step of mixing a first composition comprising at least the agent A and a second composition comprising at least the agent B to prepare a mixture that satisfies one or each of the following (A) and (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">(A) comprising the abrasive, the basic compound, the water-soluble polymer and water; and having a concentration of the basic compound of 0.1 mol/L or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">(B) comprising the abrasive, the basic compound, the water-soluble polymer H and water; and having a concentration of the abrasive of lower than 3% by mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">By applying the production method featuring the characteristics described above, a polishing composition produced by the art disclosed herein has excellent temporal stability of polishing performance despite of being a basic polishing composition. Accordingly, there are no particular limitations imposed on the time (storage time) from the preparation of the mixture that satisfies one or each of the (A) and (B) above to the actual use of a polishing composition comprising the mixture. This is preferable from the standpoint of the high flexibility of the polishing composition's storage process and use process (e.g. a process of polishing a polishing object with the polishing composition and a production process of a polished article involving the polishing). The time from the preparation of the mixture satisfying one or each of the (A) and (B) to the actual use of a polishing composition comprising the mixture can be, for instance, more than 12 hours, more than 24 hours, or even more than 48 hours (e.g. more than 48 hours up to three months). Needless to say, this does not hinder the use of the polishing composition in shorter time than the above. For instance, the time from production of the polishing composition to the actual use can be three hours or less, one hour or less, or even 30 minutes or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">Typical embodiments of the polishing composition production method according to the first aspect disclosed herein is described with respect to an example of producing a polishing composition, using silica grains as the abrasive, ammonia as the basic compound and a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol (degree of saponification 73% by mole) as the water-soluble polymer H, but the embodiments and products of the present invention are not limited by these.</div>
<heading id="h-0041">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">In this embodiment, a polishing composition is produced, using a polishing composition preparation kit in which the following agents A and B are separately stored:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">Agent A: an abrasive dispersion comprising an abrasive, a basic compound and water (a basic abrasive dispersion with 5 to 25% by mass abrasive content at a basic compound concentration of 0.0001 mol/L to 1 mol/L)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">Agent B: an aqueous solution of a water-soluble polymer H (an aqueous polymer solution with 0.02 to 50% by mass polymer content at about pH 6)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">Specifically, for instance, water is added to the agent A (abrasive dispersion C) to prepare a first composition that satisfies at least either the abrasive content being less than 3% by mass or the basic compound concentration being 0.1 mol/L or lower. Subsequently, the agent B is added to the first composition (dilute agent A in this embodiment) and mixed to obtain a polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">In this embodiment, after the agent B is added to the first composition and mixed, water may be further added as necessary to adjust the abrasive concentration of the polishing composition. Alternatively, after the agent B is added to the first composition and mixed, a basic compound may be further added as necessary to adjust the pH of the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">According to this embodiment, while using a water-soluble polymer H, a basic polishing composition can be produced with excellent stability of polishing performance, by means of adding an aqueous water-soluble polymer H solution (agent B) to the first composition that satisfies at least either the abrasive content being less than 3% by mass or the basic compound concentration being 0.1 mol/L or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">One reason for acquisition of such an effect may have to do with the co-presence of the abrasive and the water-soluble polymer H in the abrasive dispersion having an abrasive concentration of lower than 3% by mass achieved simultaneously with or before (in this embodiment, simultaneously with) achieving the co-presence of the basic compound and the water-soluble polymer H. Another reason for acquisition of the effect may have to do with the co-presence of the basic compound and the water-soluble polymer H achieved simultaneously with or before (in this embodiment, simultaneously with) obtaining a basic compound concentration of 0.1 mol/L or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">Because the agent A (abrasive dispersion C) used in this embodiment is in a state where the abrasive and the basic compound are co-present, the abrasive has increased electrostatic repulsion due to the basic compound and thereby exhibits high dispersion stability. Thus, when mixed with the water-soluble polymer, local aggregation of the abrasive can be highly prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">The agent B used in this embodiment is prepared as an aqueous solution in which the water-soluble polymer H has been dissolved in water in advance. Accordingly, when mixed with the first composition, local aggregation of the abrasive can be highly prevented. This is preferable from the standpoint of increasing the ease of filtration of a polishing composition produced according to the present embodiment or reducing defects in the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">The agent A (abrasive dispersion C) in this embodiment is advantageous from the standpoint of the convenience and reduction of costs of production, distribution, storage, etc., because it is in a concentrated form (a form at a high abrasive concentration) when compared with a polishing composition to be produced. The abrasive content in the agent A in such a concentrated form can be, for instance, 50% by mass or less. From the standpoint of the stability (e.g. the abrasive's dispersion stability) and ease of filtration of a polishing composition produced with the agent A, in usual, the abrasive content is preferably 45% by mass or less, or more preferably 40% by mass or less. In a preferable embodiment, the abrasive content can be 30% by mass or less, or even 20% by mass or less (e.g. 15% by mass or less). From the standpoint of the convenience and reduction of costs of production, distribution, storage, etc., the abrasive content can be, for instance, 0.5% by mass or greater, preferably 1% by mass or greater, or more preferably 3% by mass or greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0311">The basic compound content in the agent A is preferably 0.001% by mass or greater, more preferably 0.005% by mass or greater, or yet more preferably 0.01% by mass or greater. With increasing basic compound content, local aggregation tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when the agent A is diluted or mixed with the agent B. The basic compound content in the agent A is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 5% by mass or less, or yet more preferably 3% by mass or less. With decreasing basic compound content, it becomes easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0312">The agent A has a pH of preferably 9 or higher, or more preferably 9.5 or higher. With increasing pH, local aggregation tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when the agent A is diluted or mixed with the agent B. In general, at a higher pH, the rate of hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H increases. Thus, it may be more meaningful to apply the production method disclosed herein. The agent A has a pH of preferably 12 or lower, more preferably 11.5 or lower, or yet more preferably 10.5 or lower. When the agent pH is set low, a smaller amount of the basic compound is required to prepare the agent A, whereby it becomes easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition. For instance, when the abrasive is silicon particles, the pH being not exceedingly high is advantageous also from the standpoint of inhibiting dissolution of the silica. The agent A's pH can be adjusted by the amount (concentration) of the basic compound added and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0313">The water-soluble polymer H content (concentration) in the agent B is preferably 0.02% by mass or greater, more preferably 0.05% by mass or greater, or yet more preferably 0.1% by mass or greater. With increasing water-soluble polymer H content, it becomes easier to adjust the water-soluble polymer H content in the polishing composition. The water-soluble polymer H content in the agent B is preferably 50% by mass or less, and can be, for instance, 20% by mass or less. With decreasing water-soluble polymer H content, local aggregation of the abrasive tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when the agent B is added to the first composition (in this embodiment, the diluted agent A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">From the standpoint of inhibiting hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H, the agent B is preferably formulated to a near-neutral pH in general. The agent B's pH is usually preferably 4 or higher, but lower than 9, or more preferably 5.5 to 7.5. The art disclosed herein can be implemented, for instance, in an embodiment wherein the agent B's pH is around 6 (e.g. 6±0.3). In a preferable embodiment, the agent B can be prepared in a composition essentially free of a basic compound (e.g. a composition consisting of a water-soluble polymer H and water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">In this embodiment, the agent A comprising the abrasive and basic compound is diluted to prepare the first composition and the agent B is then added to the first composition. The agent A can be diluted by a factor that yields at least either an abrasive concentration of lower than 3% by mass or a basic compound concentration of 0.1 mol/L or lower in the first composition. The dilution factor can be, for instance, about 2 to 200 by volume, or is usually suitably about 5 to 100. The dilution factor according to a preferable embodiment is 10 to 80. For instance, it is preferably diluted by a factor of 15 to 40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">Preferable abrasive concentrations in the first composition (diluted agent A) may also vary in accordance with the abrasive concentration of the polishing composition to be produced. In usual, the abrasive concentration is preferably 2% by mass or lower, or more preferably 1% by mass or lower (e.g. 0.7% by mass or lower). In a preferable embodiment, the abrasive concentration of the first composition can be about equal to or slightly higher than the abrasive concentration of the polishing composition to be produced. For instance, the concentration can be higher by 1 to 10% by mass than the abrasive concentration of the polishing composition being produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317">Preferable basic compound concentrations of the first composition (diluted agent A) may also vary depending on the basic compound concentration of the polishing composition being produced. Usually, it is preferably 0.1 mol/L or lower, more preferably 0.05 mol/L or lower, or yet more preferably 0.02 mol/L or lower. In a preferable embodiment, the basic compound concentration of the first composition can be about equal to or slightly higher than the basic compound concentration of the polishing composition being produced. For example, the concentration (mol/L) can be higher by about 1 to 10% than the basic compound concentration (mol/L) of the polishing composition being produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">The agents A and B are preferably mixed in an embodiment where the agent B is added to the first composition (diluted agent A) as described earlier. According to such a mixing method, local aggregation of the abrasive can be prevented to a greater extent as compared with, for instance, a mixing method where the first composition is added to the agent B. When the abrasive is silica grains (e.g. colloidal silica grains), as described above, it is particularly meaningful to employ the mixing method where the agent B is added to the first composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">The agent B is added to the first composition at a rate (supply rate) of preferably, to a liter (1 L) of the first composition, 500 mL of agent B per minute or lower, more preferably 100 mL/min or lower, or yet more preferably 50 mL/min or lower. By decreasing the supply rate, local aggregation of the abrasive can be inhibited to a greater extent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0376">The polishing composition production method according to the second aspect disclosed herein can be implemented, using an abrasive, a basic compound, a water-soluble polymer H and water as described earlier. In the production method, an agent A comprising at least the basic compound and an agent B comprising the water-soluble polymer H are obtained; and at least the agent A and the agent B are mixed to prepare a polishing composition stock solution that satisfies one or each of the following conditions (A) and (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0377">(A) having a concentration of the basic compound above 0.02 mol/L.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0379" num="0378">(B) having a concentration of the abrasive of 1% by mass or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0380" num="0379">The polishing composition stock solution is diluted within 24 hours from its preparation. With respect to a polishing composition stock solution that satisfies the condition (A), the dilution is preferably carried out so as to yield a concentration of the basic compound of 0.02 mol/L or lower. With respect to a polishing composition stock solution that satisfies the condition (B), the dilution is preferably carried out so as to yield a concentration of the abrasive of lower than 1% by mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0381" num="0380">The polishing composition produced by the method disclosed herein shows excellent temporal stability of polishing performance despite of being basic. In the method, the time from the preparation of the polishing composition stock solution to the dilution of the stock solution is subject to certain limitations. On the other hand, no particular limitations are imposed on the time from obtaining the agents A and B to mixing them or the time (storage time) from the preparation of the polishing composition by diluting the polishing composition stock solution up to the use of the polishing composition. In other words, by restricting the time from the preparation of the polishing composition stock solution to the dilution of the stock solution to a basic compound concentration of 0.02 mol/L or lower or to an abrasive concentration of lower than 1% by mass, the flexibility of other processes related to the polishing composition production can be increased. In addition, since the polishing composition is prepared by first preparing the polishing composition stock solution having a basic compound concentration above 0.02 mol/L or an abrasive concentration of 1% by mass or higher followed by diluting the stock solution, it is highly convenient in the production, distribution, storage, etc., of the materials used for preparation of the stock solution, making it preferable also from the standpoint of reducing the production costs.</div>

With the time being 12 hours or less (e.g. 8 hours or less), greater effect can be obtained by applying the production method disclosed herein. The lower limit of the time is not particularly limited. For instance, the time from the preparation of the stock solution to the dilution can be 30 seconds or less. Although not particularly limited to, in a preferable embodiment, from the standpoint of taking advantage of the convenience of preparing the polishing composition stock solution first and then diluting the stock solution to prepare a polishing composition, the time from the preparation of the stock solution to the dilution can be set to about 1 hour to 10 hours (e.g. 2 hours to 8 hours).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0383" num="0382">In an embodiment of the preparation of the polishing composition satisfying the condition (A), the basic compound concentration of the stock solution is not particularly limited as long as it is higher than 0.02 mol/L.

The upper limit of basic compound concentration in the stock solution is not particularly limited. For instance, it can be 0.4 mol/L or lower. To lower the rate of hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H, in usual, the basic compound concentration is suitably 0.3 mol/L or lower, or preferably 0.15 mol/L or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0384" num="0383">The polishing composition stock solution satisfying the condition (A) is preferably diluted so that the resulting dilution has a basic compound concentration of 0.02 mol/L or lower. Preferable basic compound concentrations in the dilution may vary also in accordance with the basic compound concentration of the polishing composition to be produced. In usual, it is preferably 0.015 mol/L or lower, or more preferably 0.01 mol/L or lower. In a preferable embodiment, the basic compound concentration of the dilution can be about the same as the basic compound concentration of the polishing composition to be produced. Alternatively, for instance, the dilution may be prepared to have a slightly higher basic compound concentration (e.g. by about 1 to 10% by mass) than the polishing composition to be produced and after the stock solution is diluted within the prescribed time period to a basic compound concentration of 0.02 mol/L or lower, water may be further added at a certain timing to adjust the basic compound concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0385" num="0384">In an embodiment of the preparation of the polishing composition stock solution satisfying the condition (B), the abrasive concentration in the stock solution is not particularly limited as long as it is 1% by mass or higher.

The upper limit of abrasive concentration in the stock solution is not particularly limited. For instance, it can be 50% by mass or lower. From the standpoint of better preventing local aggregation of the abrasive, etc., in usual, the abrasive concentration is suitably 40% by mass or lower, preferably 30% by mass or lower, or more preferably 25% by mass or lower (e.g. 20% by mass or lower).</div>

Alternatively, for instance, the dilution may be prepared to have a slightly higher abrasive concentration (e.g. by about 1 to 10% by mass) than the polishing composition to be produced; and after the stock solution is diluted within the prescribed time period to an abrasive concentration of lower than 1% by mass, water may be further added at a certain timing to adjust the abrasive concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0387" num="0386">The polishing composition stock solution can be diluted by a dilution factor of, for instance, suitably greater than 3 up to about 200, usually preferably about 5 to 100, or more preferably about 10 to 70 (e.g. about 15 to 50).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0388" num="0387">The basic compound content in the polishing composition stock solution is preferably 0.01% by mass or greater, or more preferably 0.03% by mass or greater.

The basic compound content in the stock solution is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 5% by mass or less, or yet more preferably 3% by mass or less.

With increasing pH, the dispersion stability of the abrasive tends to increase. In general, at a higher pH, the rate of hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H increases. Thus, it may be more meaningful to apply the production method disclosed herein. The stock solution's pH is preferably 12 or lower, more preferably 11.5 or lower, or yet more preferably 10.5 or lower. When the stock solution's pH is set lower, it becomes easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition.

<heading id="h-0056">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0392" num="0391">In this embodiment, a polishing composition is produced, using a polishing composition preparation kit in which the following agents A and B are separately stored:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0393" num="0392">Agent A: an abrasive dispersion comprising an abrasive, a basic compound and water (a basic abrasive dispersion with 3 to 25% by mass abrasive content at a basic compound concentration of 0.02 mol/L to 1 mol/L)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0394" num="0393">Agent B: an aqueous solution of a water-soluble polymer H (an aqueous polymer solution with 0.02 to 50% by mass polymer content at about pH 6)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0395" num="0394">Specifically, for instance, the agent B is added to the agent A and mixed to prepare a polishing composition stock solution that satisfies at least either the basic compound concentration being higher than 0.02 mol/L or the abrasive concentration being 1% by mass or higher. Within an aforementioned preferable time period from the preparation of the stock solution, by adding ultrapure water to the stock solution to a concentration that satisfies at least either the basic compound concentration being 0.02 mol/L or lower or the abrasive concentration being lower than 1% by mass, a polishing composition can be produced with excellent storage stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0396" num="0395">Because the agent A used in this embodiment is in a state where the abrasive and the basic compound are co-present, the abrasive has increased electrostatic repulsion due to the basic compound and thereby exhibits high dispersion stability. Thus, when mixed with the agent B, local aggregation of the abrasive can be highly prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0397" num="0396">The agent B used in this embodiment is prepared as an aqueous solution in which the water-soluble polymer H has been dissolved in water in advance. Accordingly, when mixed with the agent A, local aggregation of the abrasive can be highly prevented. This is preferable from the standpoint of increasing the ease of filtration of a polishing composition produced according to the present embodiment or reducing defects in the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0398" num="0397">The agents A and B used in this embodiment are in concentrated forms (wherein at least either the abrasive concentration or the basic compound concentration is higher) when compared with the polishing composition to be produced. Thus, it is advantageous from the standpoint of the convenience and reduction of costs of production, distribution, storage, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0399" num="0398">The abrasive content in the agent A can be, for instance, 50% by mass or less. From the standpoint of preventing local aggregation of the abrasive to a greater extent, in usual, the abrasive concentration is suitably 40% by mass or lower, preferably 30% by mass or lower, or yet more preferably 25% by mass or lower (e.g. 20% by mass or lower). From the standpoint of the convenience and reduction of costs of production, distribution, storage, etc., the abrasive content in the agent A is, for instance, suitably greater than 2% by mass, or preferably greater than 3% by mass.</div>

With increasing basic compound content, local aggregation tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when mixed with the agent B. The basic compound content in the agent A is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 5% by mass or less, or yet more preferably 3% by mass or less. With decreasing basic compound content, it becomes easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0401" num="0400">The agent A has a pH of preferably 9 or higher, or more preferably 9.5 or higher. With increasing pH, local aggregation tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when mixed with the agent B. In general, at a higher pH, the rate of hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H increases. Thus, it may be more meaningful to apply the production method disclosed herein. The agent A has a pH of preferably 12 or lower, more preferably 11.5 or lower, or yet more preferably 10.5 or lower. When the agent A's pH is set low, it becomes easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition. For instance, when the abrasive is silicon particles, the pH being not exceedingly high is advantageous also from the standpoint of inhibiting dissolution of the silica. The agent A's pH can be adjusted by the amount (concentration) of the basic compound added and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0402" num="0401">The water-soluble polymer H content (concentration) in the agent B is preferably 0.02% by mass or greater, more preferably 0.05% by mass or greater, or yet more preferably 0.1% by mass or greater. With increasing water-soluble polymer H content, it becomes easier to adjust the water-soluble polymer H content in the polishing composition. The water-soluble polymer H content in the agent B is preferably 50% by mass or less, and can be, for instance, 20% by mass or less. With decreasing water-soluble polymer H content, local aggregation of the abrasive tends to be inhibited to a greater extent when the agent B is added to the diluted agent A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0403" num="0402">From the standpoint of inhibiting hydrolysis of the water-soluble polymer H, the agent B is preferably formulated to a near-neutral pH in general. The agent B's pH is usually preferably 4 or higher, but lower than 9, or more preferably 5.5 to 7.5. The art disclosed herein can be implemented, for instance, in an embodiment wherein the agent B's pH is around 6 (e.g. 6±0.3). In a preferable embodiment, the agent B can be prepared in a composition essentially free of a basic compound (e.g. a composition consisting of a water-soluble polymer H and water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0404" num="0403">The agents A and B are preferably mixed in an embodiment where the agent B is added to the agent A as described earlier. According to such a mixing method, local aggregation of the abrasive can be prevented to a greater extent as compared with, for instance, a mixing method where the agent A is added to the agent B. When the abrasive is silica grains (e.g. colloidal silica grains), as described above, it is particularly meaningful to employ the mixing method where the agent B is added to the agent A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0405" num="0404">The agent B is added to the agent A at a rate (supply rate) of preferably, to a liter (1 L) of agent A, 500 mL of agent B per minute or lower, more preferably 100 mL/min or lower, or yet more preferably 50 mL/min or lower. By decreasing the supply rate, local aggregation of the abrasive can be inhibited to a greater extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0406" num="0405">For preparing the agents A and B, adding the agent A to the agent B and mixing, or diluting the polishing composition stock solution, etc., the apparatus used is not particularly limited.

(4) A method for producing a polished article, the method comprising a step of supplying the polishing composition produced by the method (3) above and polishing the polishing object and the method characterized in that in the water-soluble polymer Q in the polishing composition supplied to the polishing object, the water-soluble polymer Q has a hydroxyl group content in a range of 4 mmol/g or greater, but 21 mmol/g or less.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0433" num="0432">Herein, the hydroxyl group content refers to the number of moles of hydroxyl groups contained in one gram of the polymer. The hydroxyl group content can be generally obtained by subjecting a sample solution comprising the polymer of interest to neutralization titration as specified in JIS K0070 to determine the hydroxyl value (mgKOH/g) and dividing the hydroxyl value by 56.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0434" num="0433">When the polymer of interest is, for instance, a polymer formed of vinyl carboxylate units and vinyl alcohol units such as a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol, the hydroxyl group content can also be determined as follows. Namely, potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to the sample solution containing the polymer of interest and the resulting solution is heated to allow complete saponification; the amount of KOH consumed during this is determined by titration; from the results, the number of moles of vinyl carboxylate units and the number of moles of vinyl alcohol units are determined; and from their numbers of moles, the hydroxyl group content can be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0435" num="0434">In measuring the hydroxyl group content, when a polymer contained in a polishing composition is measured, the polishing composition can be used as the sample solution. When the polishing composition comprises an abrasive, the abrasive is precipitated by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant can be used as the sample solution.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0508" num="0507">As shown in Table 4, with respect to the polishing composition of Comparative Example B1 using the fully-saponified PVA as the water-soluble polymer, while the abrasive adsorption was at or below 20%, the etching rate was higher than 2.0 nm/min, showing its poor ability to protect surfaces. Thus, when compared with Comparative Example B3 using HEC, while it showed greater ease of filtration, its haze clearly increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0509" num="0508">On the contrary, according to the polishing liquids of Examples B1 to B5—satisfying both the abrasive adsorption being 20% or lower and the etching rate being 2.0 nm/min or lower, while the filtration was as easy as Comparative Example B1, the haze value and the LPD count were significantly lower in comparison to Comparative Example B1. According to the polishing compositions of Examples B1 to B5, the haze value and the LPD count were further reduced even in comparison to Comparative Example B3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0510" num="0509">On the other hand, the polishing liquid of Comparative Example B2—which showed a low etching rate, but a high abrasive adsorption—was poorly effective in both haze reduction and LPD count reduction. An explanation to this could be that the excessively high abrasive adsorption brought about shortage of free polymer, resulting in insufficient surface protection effect. Comparative Example B3 and Comparative Example B4 having an abrasive adsorption similar to the first were both inferior to Examples B1 to B5 in both the haze value reduction effect and LPD count reduction effect</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0548" num="0547">As shown in Table 5, the polishing composition of Example C1—produced by diluting the agent A containing the abrasive and basic compound to satisfy at least either the abrasive concentration being lower than 3% by mass or the ammonia concentration being 0.1 mol/L or lower, followed by adding the aqueous water-soluble polymer HA solution to the resulting dilution—was superior in terms of both the haze value and LPD count in comparison to the polishing composition of Comparative Example C1 produced by diluting the concentrate comprising the basic compound and water-soluble polymer HA together. The polishing composition of Example C1 was also more effective in reducing the haze value and LPD count when compared against Comparative Example C4 using a widely-used water-soluble polymer, HEC. In addition, it was clearly superior to Comparative Example C4 in terms of the ease of filtration as well. The polishing compositions of Examples C2 to C4 produced in the same manner as Example C1 were also highly effective in reducing the haze value and LPD count and easily filtered as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0549" num="0548">On the other hand, the polishing composition of Comparative Example C2—using PVA comprising vinyl alcohol units similarly to water-soluble polymers HA and HB, but being essentially free of vinyl acetate units—was produced in the same manner as Examples C1 to C4, but did not produce the effect to reduce the haze value and LPD count as Examples C1 to C4 did. The polishing composition of Comparative Example C3 produced with PVP (an ester bond-free water-soluble polymer) in the same manner as Examples C1 to C4 also fell short of Examples C1 to C4 in terms of the haze value and LPD count.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0550" num="0549">It is noted that in Examples C1 to C4, after the preparation, the polishing compositions were stored at room temperature for about one hour until used for polishing; however, even when the storage time was changed to 12 hours or 48 hours, in comparison to Comparative Examples C1 to C4, the effects were comparable to the results shown in Table 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0551" num="0550">Just before the respective polishing compositions of Examples C1 to C4 were put in use for polishing, the ratios of numbers of moles of vinyl acetate units to numbers of moles of all monomeric repeat units constituting the water-soluble polymers in the respective polishing compositions were determined and found to be 25% in Example C1, 19% in Example C2, 19% in Example C3 and 16% in Example C4. In other words, the polishing compositions according to Examples C1 to C4 were found to contain a water-soluble polymer (polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of saponification of 95% by mole or lower) with the molar ratio of vinyl acetate units being maintained at or above 5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0552" num="0551">The molar ratios were determined as follows: The abrasive in the polishing composition was precipitated by centrifugation; While a basic compound was added to the resulting supernatant as a sample solution and the resultant was heated to complete saponification, the amount of basic compound consumed was titrated; From the result, the number of moles of vinyl carboxylate units and the number of moles of vinyl alcohol units were determined.</div>

The average primary particle diameter was measured with a surface area analyzer under trade name “FLOW SORB II 2300” available from Micromeritics.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0591" num="0590">As shown in Table 6, among Examples D1 to D5 and Comparative Examples D1 to D2 each using a partially-saponified polyvinyl alcohol as the water-soluble polymer H, the polishing compositions of Examples D1 to D5—produced with the time spent being 24 hours or less from the preparation of the polishing composition stock solution to the dilution—were clearly superior in terms of both the haze value and LPD count in comparison to Comparative Examples D1 to D2 wherein the time was more than 24 hours. The polishing compositions of D1 to D5 showed greater effect to reduce the haze value and LPD count even when compared against Comparative Example D5 using HEC (a widely-used water-soluble polymer) and were also clearly superior to Comparative Example D5 in terms of the ease of filtration as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0592" num="0591">In addition, in comparison of Example D2 with Example D4, it can be seen that with the time from the stock solution preparation to the dilution being 10 hours or less, as compared with a case where the dilution is performed at 12 hours after the stock solution preparation, a polishing composition can be produced to provide higher performance in terms of the haze value and LPD count. Similar tendencies are apparent in the LPD counts of Example D3 and Example D5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0593" num="0592">On the other hand, the polishing composition of Comparative Example D3—using the PVA that comprised vinyl alcohol units similarly to water-soluble polymers HA and HB, but was essentially free of vinyl acetate units—was produced with the time form the stock solution preparation to the dilution being one minute just like in Example D1, but did not produce the effect to reduce the haze value and LPD count as Example D1 did. The polishing composition of Comparative Example D4 produced with PVP (an ester bond-free water-soluble polymer) in the same manner as Examples D1 to D5 also fell short of Examples D1 to D5 in teens of the haze value and LPD count.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0594" num="0593">It is noted that in Examples D1 to D5, after the preparation, the polishing compositions were stored at room temperature for about one hour until used for polishing; however, even when the storage time was changed to 12 hours or 48 hours, in comparison to Comparative Examples D1 to D5, the effects were comparable to the results shown in Table 6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0595" num="0594">Just before the respective polishing compositions of Examples D1 to D5 were put in use for polishing, the ratios of numbers of moles of vinyl acetate units to numbers of moles of all monomeric repeat units constituting the water-soluble polymers in the respective polishing compositions were determined and found to be 27% in Example D1, 18% in Example D2, 15% in Example D3, 10% in Example D4 and 8% in Example D5. In other words, the polishing compositions according to Examples D1 to D5 were found to contain a water-soluble polymer (polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of saponification of 95% by mole or lower) with the molar ratio of vinyl acetate units being maintained at or above 5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0596" num="0595">The molar ratios were determined as follows: The abrasive in the polishing composition was precipitated by centrifugation; While a basic compound was added to the resulting supernatant as a sample solution and the resultant was heated to complete saponification, the amount of basic compound consumed was titrated; From the result, the number of moles of vinyl carboxylate units and the number of moles of vinyl alcohol units were determined.</div>
