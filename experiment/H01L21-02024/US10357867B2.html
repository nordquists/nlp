<heading id="h-0001">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/706,506, filed Dec. 6, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuits are typically fabricated on a semiconductor wafer, with many individual dies manufactured simultaneously on the same wafer. Processing steps are used to form layers of metal and dielectrics on the semiconductor wafer to define interconnect structures, as well as active and passive electronic devices. Many of the processing steps result in non-planar layers. However, it is often desirable for layers of the integrated circuit to have uniform thickness. Thus, polishing is required both to provide uniform thickness, and a smooth layer surface, which not only ensure device performance, but also aid subsequent processing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Polishing techniques include mechanical planarization (MP) and chemical mechanical planarization/polishing (CMP). A typical CMP system will include a large polishing pad, on which a chemical slurry is introduced to facilitate wafer polishing, and a polishing head. To polish a semiconductor wafer, the semiconductor wafer is held by the polishing head, and the polishing head simultaneously applies a force to press the semiconductor wafer against the rotating polishing pad, while also rotating the semiconductor wafer.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The making and using of the present embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the disclosed subject matter, and do not limit the scope of the different embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments will be described with respect to a specific context, namely a polishing system and the like. Other embodiments may also be applied, however, to other polishing systems which are used to polish material surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Throughout the various figures and discussion, like reference numbers refer to like components. Also, although singular components may be depicted throughout some of the figures, this is for simplicity of illustration and ease of discussion. A person having ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that such discussion and depiction can be and usually is applicable for many components within a structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Polishing heads hold onto a circular semiconductor wafer by use of a retaining ring, and press the semiconductor wafer against a spinning polishing pad to planarize and/or polish a face of the semiconductor wafer. As the semiconductor wafer spins, due to the nature of angular motion, tangential velocity increases from the center of the semiconductor wafer to its edge. Thus, if the semiconductor wafer were pressed against the polishing pad by uniform pressure, edges of the semiconductor wafer would be polished more heavily than central regions. To address this issue, applicators are introduced in the polishing head to vary curvature of the semiconductor wafer during polishing, which compensates for the differences in tangential velocity over the radius of the semiconductor wafer. The applicators, which may include mechanical parts, such as springs or pistons, press against the semiconductor wafer to cause temporary curvature thereof. For various reasons, including aging, defects, and damage, the applicators do not perform as expected. As a result, the semiconductor wafer may exhibit uneven polishing after the polishing process is completed, which affects yield and throughput.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following disclosure, a novel polishing system is introduced, which uses a polishing pad having diameter smaller than the semiconductor wafer to achieve high uniformity when polishing the semiconductor wafer. In the polishing system disclosed herein, the semiconductor wafer may lie face-up on a table, while the polishing pad polishes the semiconductor wafer using a combination of a proper slurry and downward pressure. The polishing pad, being smaller than the semiconductor wafer, may sweep over the surface of the semiconductor wafer in a pattern that is programmable, or even adaptable based on in-line metrology data. Multiple polishing pads may be used sequentially, simultaneously, or in a combination of the two to increase flexibility and throughput.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The polishing system also provides a cleaning operation that can be performed without removing the semiconductor wafer to a separate cleaning station. After any polishing operation, a cleaning operation may be performed to remove excess slurry, for example. In the polishing system disclosed herein, the cleaning operation may be performed by a roller brush in combination with distilled water or a cleaning agent, for example. With the semiconductor wafer still face-up on the table, the roller brush is lowered onto the semiconductor wafer to clean the semiconductor wafer. Following the cleaning operation, further polishing operations may be performed using the polishing pad disclosed herein without removing the semiconductor wafer from the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The polishing pad in some embodiments also acts as an auxiliary polishing pad(s) in a rework operation to polish the semiconductor wafer in certain regions, while leaving other regions of the semiconductor wafer unaffected. The polishing pad is smaller than the semiconductor wafer, and is controllable in three dimensions. Taking metrology data following a first polishing process on a main polishing pad having a diameter greater than that of the semiconductor wafer, a second polishing profile can be programmed into the polishing system, and the auxiliary polishing pad can be used in conjunction with a polishing head to rework the semiconductor wafer under process, without taking the semiconductor wafer offline from the polishing system. Multiple small auxiliary polishing pads can be used in conjunction with the polishing head to provide even greater polishing profile flexibility and throughput. In some embodiments, a bevel polishing pad is also used in conjunction with the polishing head to polish a bevel region of the semiconductor wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> includes active and/or passive devices formed thereon and therein. For example, doped regions are formed in the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> to define transistors. In some embodiments, dielectric and polysilicon layers are defined to form gates of the transistors.

The various devices and interconnect structures may primarily be formed on a front face <b>201</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b>. In the polishing system <b>10</b>, the front face <b>201</b> may face toward polishing head <b>110</b>, while a back face of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> may face away from polishing head <b>110</b>, and be in contact with the wafer table <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The wafer table <b>120</b> supports the wafer <b>200</b>, and in some embodiments has a wafer contacting surface made of a material such as silica gel. For the wafer <b>200</b> having the width w<b>1</b>, the wafer table <b>120</b> may be of width greater than the width w<b>1</b> by at least 20 cm, for example.

Examples of the width w<b>1</b> include 300 millimeters and 450 millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The wafer table <b>120</b> may spin the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> at a first rate and in a first direction. Spin variables of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b>, such as speed and direction, may be controlled by the rotation control mechanism <b>121</b>. In some embodiments, the rotation control mechanism <b>121</b> is controlled by the system controller <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the rotation control mechanism <b>121</b> causes rotation of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> through an electric motor. In some embodiments, the electric motor is an alternating current (AC) motor, a direct current (DC) motor, a universal motor, or the like, and has fixed or variable speed. In some embodiments, the rotation control mechanism <b>121</b> includes electronics for setting the speed of the electric motor.

In some embodiments, the control signals are real-time speed indication signals, and/or a spin rate profile specifying rotation speeds of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> over time throughout a polishing process. Embodiments in which the rotation control mechanism <b>121</b> is optional are also contemplated herein, for example when the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> is not rotated during polishing, but is stationary on the wafer table <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The polishing head <b>110</b> holds the polishing pad <b>111</b>, and is controllable by the system controller <b>140</b> to apply pressure to the wafer <b>200</b> through the polishing pad <b>111</b>. The system controller <b>140</b> is also capable of translating the polishing pad <b>111</b> through three dimensions as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and also rotating the polishing pad <b>111</b> at a second rate and in a second direction. The polishing head <b>110</b> is controllable by the system controller <b>140</b> (for example) to translate in the three dimensions relative to the front face <b>201</b>. Two dimensions are indicated by crossing arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with the third dimension being in and out of the figure, orthogonal to the axes depicted by the crossing arrows. In some embodiments, the polishing pad <b>111</b> spins at the second rate and in the second direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), which is be the same or different than the first rate and the first direction of the wafer <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the second rate is fixed or variable, and is programmable and/or adjustable based on in-line metrology feedback provided by the metrology tools <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the second rate is set in real-time by the system controller <b>140</b>, and/or as a predefined profile specifying rotation rates and directions of the polishing pad <b>111</b> over time throughout the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">A polishing surface of the polishing pad <b>111</b> faces toward the front face <b>201</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the polishing pad <b>111</b> polishes the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b> through a combination of mechanical and chemical removal of layer material. In some embodiments, the polishing pad <b>111</b> is made of a polymer. The width w<b>2</b> of the polishing pad <b>111</b> is shorter than the width w<b>1</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>200</b>.

The metrology tools <b>130</b> include a laser interferometer, for example. Based on the metrology information provided to the system controller <b>140</b>, in some embodiments, the system controller <b>140</b> controls various process variables during the polishing process.

Other angles of rotation are also contemplated, such as 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. In some embodiments, a first positioning mechanism <b>680</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) rotates the polishing head <b>610</b> away from the main polishing pad <b>600</b>, for example, so that the polishing head <b>610</b> faces up.

As an example, a ring zone is loosely defined by an inner radius and an outer radius. Then, a central radius, or track, is obtained by averaging the inner and outer radii, for example. Width of the track is obtained by subtracting the inner radius from the outer radius, for example. Thus, on a 300 mm wafer, a track of width about 40 mm and center radius about 90 mm is found corresponding to an inner radius of about 70 mm and an outer radius of about 110 mm, as only one example. In some embodiments, the track corresponds to one or more of the applicators <b>615</b>-<b>618</b>, such as the outer zone applicator <b>617</b>, for example.</div>

For the localized areas shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, holding the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> stationary is preferable, and the auxiliary polishing pads <b>653</b>, <b>657</b> are positioned over centers of the localized areas, or are translated in patterns to provide uniform polishing coverage over the localized areas. For two or more improperly polished regions, the improperly polished regions are polished simultaneously, sequentially, or a combination of the two (for three or more improperly polished regions).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the localized areas in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are polished while the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> is spinning. Knowing the spin rate of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>, radii corresponding to centers of the localized areas, and radial lengths of the localized areas, stutter frequencies are calculated, such that the auxiliary polishing pad(s) <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> remain mostly stationary, and apply short bursts of pressure as the localized area(s) pass by the auxiliary polishing pad(s) <b>651</b>, <b>652</b>. For example, if an improperly polished area has a center located at an 80 mm radius from the center of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>, and average radius of 15 mm, and the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> is spun at 60 revolutions per minute (rpm), the improperly polished area passes the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> (for example) once per second. The auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> is then lowered and raised with a stutter frequency of 1 Hz. Contact time for each pulse in which the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> is applied pressure to polish the face of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> is set in various manners, including time required for the improperly polished area to pass the area of the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b>. If radius of the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> is about 25 mm, time for the improperly polished area to pass through the length of the auxiliary polishing pad is approximated to about D<sub>PAD</sub>/V<sub>CENTER</sub>, where D<sub>PAD </sub>is diameter of the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> (50 mm in the example given), and V<sub>CENTER </sub>is linear velocity of the center of the improperly polished area. In the example given, D<sub>PAD </sub>is 50 mm (25 mm*2), and V<sub>CENTER </sub>is about 503 mm/s (2*π*80 mm/s), which gives a pulse width of approximately 1/10 second, or 100 milliseconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The second polishing process <b>1600</b> is performed as part of the full polishing process <b>1500</b>, as described above. In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, the second polishing process <b>1600</b> is performed independently, for example as part of a batch rework system, where the metrology data is saved in a server or portable storage medium, for example, and downloaded from the server during rework (the second polishing process) of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> is part of the polishing system <b>60</b>. In some embodiments, the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> is an independent polishing system, such as a rework station, for example. In such an independent polishing system, a polishing head similar to the polishing head <b>610</b> is utilized to hold the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, a wafer table is utilized to hold the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> while auxiliary polishing units similar to the auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> perform a second polishing process on the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>. This type of configuration is appropriate when the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> is to be taken offline prior to undergoing the second polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 14</figref>, the polishing head <b>610</b> is shown facing up, while the auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> face down. Embodiments in which the polishing head <b>610</b> faces down, while the auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> face up are also contemplated herein. In this configuration, the polishing head <b>610</b> lifts the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> from the main polishing pad <b>600</b>, translates the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> to a position over the auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b>, and lowers the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> and/or raises the auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> to make contact and polish the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> through the second polishing process described above. No rotation of the polishing head <b>610</b> is required in such a configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Embodiments where the polishing system <b>60</b> does not include the main polishing pad <b>600</b> and the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> polishes the entire face of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> are contemplated herein. In some embodiments, the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> has a width similar to the width of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>, for example. Then, block <b>1510</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is modified to use the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> having the width similar to the width of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>. Block <b>1520</b> is removed from the full polishing process <b>1500</b>, and a second auxiliary polishing pad, such as the auxiliary polishing pad <b>652</b>, having width shorter than the width of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> is used to polish the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> using the second predefined polishing profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> is also used as a bevel polisher in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. An auxiliary bevel polishing unit <b>1700</b> and bevel polishing scheme are depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref>. The auxiliary bevel polishing unit <b>1700</b> includes a bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b>. To polish a bevel region <b>701</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>, the auxiliary bevel polishing unit <b>1700</b> spins the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The spinning bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> is translated toward the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> to make contact with the bevel region <b>701</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In some embodiments, a lower inclined portion of the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> having a first angle θ<b>1</b> relative to the face of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> polishes the bevel region <b>701</b> first. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> is translated downward, such that an upper inclined portion of the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> having a second angle θ<b>2</b> relative to the face of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> polishes the bevel region <b>701</b>. In some embodiments, the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> is moved toward the center of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> to bring the bevel region <b>701</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> back to the meeting point of the upper and lower inclined portions, then moved up to polish the bevel region <b>701</b> by the lower inclined portion again. In some embodiments, these steps are iterated prior to translating the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> away from the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Embodiments where the bevel polishing pad <b>1701</b> and the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> are the same pad are also contemplated herein. For example, a downward-facing surface of the auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> polishes the face of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>, and a side surface of the same auxiliary polishing pad <b>651</b> polishes the bevel of the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The polishing system <b>60</b> including the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b>, by using the polishing head <b>610</b> as a portable wafer table, saves space and rework time over traditional polishing systems. The auxiliary polishing units <b>651</b>, <b>652</b> of the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> allow for numerous polishing profiles to be used, and can be tied in with the metrology data provided by the metrology tools <b>630</b> to provide automated, in line rework without taking the semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> offline. The auxiliary bevel polishing unit <b>1200</b> and the cleaning unit <b>1600</b> in the auxiliary polishing system <b>650</b> also save time, eliminating the need for offline bevel polishing and cleaning stations. The semiconductor wafer <b>700</b> can be polished, bevel polished, and cleaned in the same station, which saves space and greatly reduces wafer transfer time. The polishing system <b>60</b> saves space and time, and has flexible polishing profile control, which translates into an increase in both yield and throughput.</div>
