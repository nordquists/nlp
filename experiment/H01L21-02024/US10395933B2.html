<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In conventional examples, each of semiconductor wafers such as silicon wafers is manufactured by slicing a silicon ingot to fabricate wafers and then performing respective processes, e.g., chamfering, lapping, etching, polishing, cleaning, and the like. Further, to eliminate defects on a wafer surface where a device is formed, for example, a technology to grow an epitaxial layer on a surface of each wafer by a vapor phase epitaxial growth method is used (see Patent Literature 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in case of growing an epitaxial layer on a silicon wafer, in a relationship between the silicon wafer and the epitaxial layer, when their dopant concentrations are different from each other, lattice constants of atoms constituting these members are not the same. Thus, it is known that the silicon wafer having an epitaxially grown surface is apt to warp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As a countermeasure, in at least one of grinding and polishing, a method to perform processing so that a bowl-like dent is formed at a central portion of the silicon wafer and to thereby warp the wafer is used (see Patent Literature 2). Since adopting such a method enables canceling out stress caused due to a dopant concentration difference between the silicon wafer and the epitaxial layer by using the warp produced in the grinding or the like, and hence generation of a large warp of an epitaxial wafer can be suppressed.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the method disclosed in Patent Literature 2 can only cope with the grinding or the polishing where one surface of the wafer is held by using a single-side adsorption mechanism. Thus, even a semiconductor manufacturing method which has a process such as double-side polishing to polish both surfaces of the wafer without having the single-side adsorption mechanism requires a technology to suppress generation of a large warp after the epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there has been devised a method for measuring directions of warps of wafers, reversing the wafers as required before forming a laser mark which determines a front or back side or before the double-side polishing so that the directions of the warps become uniform, and then growing an epitaxial layer. In case of an epitaxial growth wafer, the directions of the warps of the wafers can be set to a downwardly protruding direction. However, when the wafer reversed to uniform the direction of the warp is subjected to the double-side polishing using a carrier, there arises a problem that flatness is degraded. Further, to avoid such degradation of the flatness in the double-side polishing, a method for uniforming the directions of the warps of the wafers after the double-side polishing and then forming a laser mark can be considered, but the flatness of the wafer is degraded due to debris produced due to the laser mark.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of such a problem as described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer, which can suppress the degradation of flatness of a wafer after the double-side polishing even in case of uniforming directions of warps of the wafers to one direction before the double-side polishing process.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the object, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer including: slicing off a plurality of wafers from an ingot; chamfering outer peripheral portions of the plurality of sliced wafers; and holding the plurality of chamfered wafers by using a carrier which holds the outer peripheral portions of the wafers and performing double-side polishing to polish both surfaces of each wafer whose outer peripheral portion is held by the carrier, the method being characterized in that the method includes performing warp direction adjustment to uniform directions of warps of the plurality of wafers in one direction after the slicing and before the chamfering, and the chamfering and the double-side polishing are performed in a state where the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction after the warp direction adjustment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, when the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction after the slicing and before the chamfering, it is possible to suppress the degradation of flatness of the wafers, which have been subjected to the double-side polishing, in the double-side polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">At this time, in the warp direction adjustment, the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are determined, and some of the plurality of wafers are reversed based on a result of the determination, thus the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers can be uniformed in one direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">More specifically, in the warp direction adjustment, the warps of the plurality of wafers can be uniformed in one direction.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Although an embodiment of the present invention will now be described hereinafter, the present invention is not restricted thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, to uniform warps of wafers in one direction, when double-side polishing using a carrier was applied to each wafer reversed before laser marking, considerable degradation of flatness was observed in some situations. Thus, the present inventors paid attention to a shape of an end surface of each wafer, and conducted various experiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">As a result, the present inventors have found out that engagement of chamfered shapes, which are vertically asymmetric due to a difference in removal stock between an upper part and a lower part of a wafer end portion, and a shape of an end surface of a carrier coming into contact with the wafer had changed due to reversing the wafer before double-side polishing. Further, they have also found that this change in engagement leads to degradation of flatness of the wafer in the double-side polishing. Thus, the present inventors have discovered that uniforming directions of wafers in one direction before chamfering enables suppressing the degradation of the flatness after the double-side polishing, thereby bringing the present invention to completion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention will now be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention includes at least slicing to slice off a plurality of wafers from an ingot (S<b>101</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), warp direction adjustment to uniform directions of warps of the plurality of wafers in one direction (S<b>102</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), chamfering to chamfer outer peripheral portions of the plurality of wafers (S<b>103</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and double-side polishing to polish both surfaces of each wafer (S<b>104</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">First, the slicing is performed (S<b>101</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this process, an ingot such as a silicon ingot is sliced into a plurality of wafers. The slicing can be performed by using a wire saw. When the ingot is sliced by using the wire saw, wafers having warps in opposite directions are produced at both ends of the ingot due to an influence of grooved rollers forming a wire row, the ingot itself, thermal expansion of each portion, and the like. It is to be noted that a slicing apparatus which can be used in the present invention is not restricted to the wire saw. Besides the wire saw, a slicing apparatus including an inner diameter slicer or a band saw can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Subsequently, after the slicing (S<b>101</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and before the chamfering (S<b>103</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the warp direction adjustment (S<b>102</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is performed. In the warp direction adjustment, directions of warps of the plurality of wafers can be uniformed in one direction by, e.g., the following method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">First, the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are determined. The direction of the warp of each wafer can be evaluated by using Bow as an index. Bow is a numerical value of a displacement amount from a reference point at a wafer center to a central surface at a wafer middle point. A warp of the wafer can be determined to protrude downward when Bow has a negative value, and the warp of the wafer can be determined to protrude upward when Bow has a positive value. In the measurement of Bow, a measurement apparatus such as SBW-33 (manufactured by Kobelco Research Institute Inc.) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, when some of the plurality of wafers are reversed based on determination results of the warps of the plurality of wafers, the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction. At this time, the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers can be uniformed in any one of a downwardly protruding direction and an upwardly protruding direction. A wafer reversing operation can be carried out by using a reversal mechanism attached to the measurement apparatus, e.g., SBW-330.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">After execution of the warp direction adjustment, the chamfering (S<b>103</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is performed. According to the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer of the present invention, in this chamfering, in a state where the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction, outer peripheral portions of the wafers are chamfered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">After execution of the chamfering, the double-side polishing is performed (S<b>104</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). According to the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer of the present invention, in the double-side polishing, likewise, both surfaces of each wafer are polished in a state where the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction. In the double-side polishing, for example, such a double-side polishing apparatus as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the double-side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> includes an upper turntable <b>11</b> and a lower turn table <b>12</b> which are provided to vertically face each other, and a polishing pad <b>13</b> is attached to each of the turn tables <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. A sun gear <b>14</b> is provided at a central portion between the upper turntable <b>11</b> and the lower turntable <b>12</b>, and an annular internal gear <b>15</b> is provided at a peripheral edge portion between the same. When each wafer W is inserted into a holding hole of a carrier <b>16</b>, its outer peripheral portion is held, and the wafer W is sandwiched between the upper turntable <b>11</b> and the lower turntable <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, outer peripheral teeth of the carrier <b>16</b> mesh with respective tooth portions of the sun gear <b>14</b> and the internal gear <b>15</b>, and the carrier <b>16</b> revolves around the sun gear <b>14</b> while rotating on its own axis as the upper turntable <b>11</b> and the lower turntable <b>12</b> are rotated by a driving source. At this time, both surfaces of each wafer W, whose outer peripheral portion is held in the holding hole of the carrier <b>16</b>, are simultaneously polished when the wafer W is rubbed by the upper and lower polishing pads <b>13</b>. It is to be noted that, at the time of polishing each wafer W, slurry is supplied to the wafer W from a non-illustrated nozzle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present invention, before performing the chamfering, the warp directions of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction. Thus, in the double-side polishing which is performed while holding the outer peripheral portion of each wafer W by the carrier <b>16</b>, engagement of a chamfered shape of each wafer and an end surface shape of the carrier coming into contact with the wafer (a shape of an inner peripheral surface of each holding hole of the carrier <b>16</b> in the polishing apparatus <b>10</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is the same in the respective wafers. Thus, even in case of uniforming the warp directions of the wafers in one direction, degradation of flatness of the wafers due to the double-side polishing can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">It is to be noted that the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention may include any other process generally adopted in manufacture of semiconductor wafers than the slicing, the warp direction adjustment, the chamfering, and the double-side polishing. For example, the method may include lapping to flatten each chamfered wafer, etching to remove damage caused due to the lapping, laser marking to perform marking by applying laser to a surface of each wafer in the double-side polishing, and the like.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the present invention will be more specifically described hereinafter with reference to an example and a comparative example of the present invention, the present invention is not restricted the examples.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Semiconductor wafers were manufactured based on the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention. In Example, the slicing, the warp direction adjustment, the chamfering, the lapping, the laser making, and the double-side polishing were performed in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the slicing, in both Example and later-described Comparative Example, a silicon ingot with a diameter of 300 mm manufactured by a CZ method (a Czochralski method) was sliced by using a wire saw to fabricate wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the warp direction adjustment, directions of warps were uniformed in such a manner that they become a downwardly protruding direction in all the wafers. At this time, a value of Bow of each wafer was measured by SBW-330 to determine a direction of the warp. Furthermore, each wafer which warps in an upwardly protruding direction is reversed by using the reversing mechanism attached to SBW-330 so that the directions of warps of the wafers are uniformed in the downwardly protruding direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In Example, the chamfering and the double-side polishing were performed in a state where the directions of the warps of the plurality of wafers are uniformed in one direction in such a manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">After completion of the double-side polishing, to evaluate flatness of each wafer, which was reversed in the warp direction adjustment, after the double-side polishing, SFQR (Site front surface referenced least squares range) was measured. SFQR is a range of positive and negative deviations from a reference surface which is provided by determining a cell having an arbitrary dimension on the surface and performing a least squares method to a surface of this cell. Moreover, in the SFQR measurement, Wafer Sight (manufactured by KLA-TENCOR) was used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a measurement result of SFQR according to Example. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a percentage of wafers having SFQR=21 to 24 nm is highest, and this percentage exceeds 30%. Additionally, a cumulative frequency reaches 100% before SFQR=36 nm is attained. These results have revealed that the method for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention by which the directions of the warps of the wafers are uniformed in one direction before the chamfering enables suppressing degradation of the flatness in the double-side polishing and providing the semiconductor wafers with the excellent flatness at a high rate.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Comparative Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Semiconductor wafers were manufactured under the same conditions except that an order of the respective manufacturing processes in manufacture of the semiconductor wafers was set to an order of the slicing, the chamfering, the warp direction adjustment, the lapping, the laser marking, and the double-side polishing, i.e., except that the warp direction adjustment was performed after the chamfering. Further, SFQR of each wafer, which was reversed in the warp direction adjustment, after the double-side polishing was measured by the same method as that of Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a measurement result of SFQR according to Comparative Example. A percentage of wafers having SFQR=33 to 36 nm is highest, and this percentages is 20%. Furthermore, a cumulative frequency eventually reaches 100% when SFQR=60 nm is attained. As described above, in Comparative Example, a percentage of the semiconductor wafers having degraded flatness is higher than that of Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">It is to be noted that the present invention is not restricted to the embodiment. The embodiment is an illustrative example, and any example which has substantially the same structure and exerts the same functions and effect as the technical concept described in claims of the present invention is included in the technical scope of the present invention.</div>
