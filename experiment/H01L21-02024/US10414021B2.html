<heading id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to an abrasive particle for polishing a surface of an object material such as sapphire, silicon carbide (SiC), or gallium nitride (GaN). The present invention also relates to a manufacturing method of the above abrasive particle. Further, the present invention also relates to a polishing method, a polishing device, and slurry for polishing.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">In recent years, multifunctional and high-performance semiconductor devices are continuously proposed. In response to the proposals, materials other than silicon (Si) are newly adopted to the substrate of the semiconductor device. Among those substrate materials, sapphire, SiC (for power device), and GaN (for light-emitting diode (LED)) etc. draw special attention to meet the proposals. On the other hands, it is desired to develop new processing methods of substrate, in order to achieve a mass-production of more high-performance devices at low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">In a manufacturing process of the semiconductor device, a polishing process is performed to flat the surface of the semiconductor substrate. In a conventional polishing process, oil slurry including diamond abrasive particles is used. Specifically, the surface of the semiconductor substrate formed from silicon carbide is mechanically polished by the diamond abrasive particles harder than silicon carbide. Since the polishing rate of this process is high, the polishing amount reaches a target amount in a short period of time. However, there is a risk of greatly damaging the surface of the substrate. In short, it is difficult to obtain a high quality of polishing surface. Furthermore, since the quality of the oil slurry is changed by the heat generated during the polishing process, the diamond abrasive particles contained in the slurry aggregate. As the result, the expensive diamond particles cannot be reused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">To solve the above problem, a polishing method utilizing a mechanochemical effect has been introduced (Patent Document 1). In the mechanochemical polishing, the surface of the object material is altered, and then polished by abrasive particles softer than the object material. Thus, the surface of the object material is not damaged so much. Further, in order to improve the polishing rate, techniques polishing silicon carbide with oxidizing agent are introduced (Patent Documents 2, 3 and 4).</div>

<heading id="h-0009">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0010">Problem to be Resolved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">In the dry polishing method disclosed at Patent Document 1, heat is generated due to the friction between the object material and the abrasive particles. The high frictional heat accelerates a mechanochemical polishing. Thus, the polishing rate is improved. However, the abrasive particles and waste generated due to the polishing have been exposed to the high frictional heat. So, the abrasive particles and the waste adhere to the inside of the polishing device. Thus, there is the problem that it takes time to clean up the device and therefore the productivity is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">On the other hands, in the wet polishing method disclosed in Patent Documents 2 and 3, oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide is added to slurry to oxidize the surface of the object material. Herewith, the polishing rate is improved. However, the slurry including the oxidizing agent may deteriorate a working environment and increase the liquid-waste treatment cost. Moreover, the oxidizing agent possibly corrodes the polishing device. In the wet polishing method disclosed at Patent Document 4, strong alkaline slurry is used to accelerate the mechanochemical polishing, that is, to improve the polishing rate. However, the strong alkaline slurry of pH 10 to 14 may deteriorate the working environment and increase the liquid-waste treatment cost. Anyway, in the above methods, the property of the slurry tends to change during the polishing process. This necessitates monitoring and adjustment of the process by workers, making an automation of the process impossible. Accordingly, in the conventional methods, it is difficult to polish SiC or GaN having high corrosion-resistance with high quality, at a practically high polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">To solve the problem described above, the present invention is objected to provide abrasive particles and its production method capable of polishing the object material with high quality at high polishing rate, while employing the wet polishing method and the polishing method inducing the mechanochemical effect. Additionally, the present invention is objected to provide environment-friendly abrasive slurry, a wet polishing method and a polishing device which use the environment-friendly abrasive slurry.</div>

<heading id="h-0061">Effect of the Present Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0059">In the abrasive particles of the present invention, several kinds of component are directly joined with each other and integrated to particles using mechanical alloying process. Since the biding energy between components joined using the mechanical alloying process is strong, the integrated particles will not decompose during the polishing process. Further, since the mechanochemical effect is induced on the surface of the object material by components exerting a chemical abrasive action, it becomes possible to polish the object material at high polishing rate with the abrasive particle having a Mohs' hardness lower than the object material. Further, a reaction promoter accelerates the chemical abrasive action by reacting to the heat generated in a friction between the outer surface of the abrasive particle and the surface of the object material. Therefore, the polishing rate is further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0060">Several kinds of component are joined together (integrated to an abrasive particle), while maintaining the respective inherent material properties. Therefore, each abrasive particle can exert its own function serially. As the result, the polishing process is accelerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0061">If a component having a relatively high rigidity is employed for a mechanical polishing, it makes possible to polish the object material at a high speed. On the other hand, if a component having a relatively low rigidity is employed for the mechanical polishing, it makes possible to polish the object material with high quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0062">The slurry produced by scattering the above described abrasive particles into pure water is almost harmless and does not affect badly on a working environment. Further, the liquid-waste treatment of the slurry is also easy. Additionally, since only a little amount of component of the abrasive particles is consumed during the polishing process, the slurry can be used repeatedly, and then it is also economical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0063">Generally, in a conventional wet polishing method utilizing slurry such as water etc., the chemical abrasive action cannot be fully exerted, since the thermal energy is diffused. On the other hand, by using the abrasive particle of the present invention, where the several kinds of component are integrated, thermal energy can be utilized efficiently and it can exert the chemical abrasive action sufficiently, even in the wet polishing method.</div>

<heading id="h-0063">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing an external structure of an abrasive particle of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0080">An abrasive particle <b>10</b> of the present invention is used to polish various object materials such as sapphire, silicon carbide, and gallium nitride. As shown in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the abrasive particle <b>10</b> includes first components <b>12</b>, second components <b>13</b>, and reaction promoters <b>14</b>. The first components <b>12</b>, the second components <b>13</b>, and the reaction promoters <b>14</b> are joined with each other using a mechanical alloying process, while maintaining inherent material properties of them. The first component <b>12</b> exerts a mechanical polishing action to an object material. The second component <b>13</b> exerts a chemical polishing action to the object material. The reaction promoter <b>14</b> promotes the chemical polishing action in response to the friction heat generated when the object material is polished. These components are integrated to constitute the abrasive particle <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0081">Further, an abrasive particle <b>11</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) consisting of only the second component <b>13</b> and the third component (reaction promotor) <b>14</b> will be described later. Furthermore, any combination of these components is possible. The chemical polishing action includes an action for inducing a mechanochmical effect to alter the surface of the object material. The chemical polishing action also includes an action for oxidizing the polishing surface of the object material in response to the friction heat generated during the polishing process. Due to these actions, the rigidity of the surface of the object material is lowered for polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0082">The combination of the second component, which oxidizes the polishing surface of the object material in response to the friction heat generated during the polishing process, and the third component, which promotes the oxidization of the polishing surface with the frictional heat, is also satisfactory practical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0083">As described above, in the present invention, several kinds of components are joined (integrated) each other. This means that these components are adjoined without any other connecting material such as adhesive agent. When several components are joined together using the mechanical alloying process, amorphous layers <b>15</b> are formed on the boundary surface between the components, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. These components are joined together through the amorphous layer <b>15</b>. In other words, each inorganic compound component is joined by a chemical activity of the amorphous layer <b>15</b> generated on the crystalline surface using the mechanical alloying process. The binding force between compounds is so strong that each component of inorganic compound does not separate easily throughout the polishing process. Thus, when each component of the abrasive particle comes into contact with the object material, the property of each component of the abrasive particle is exerted serially. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the amorphous layers <b>15</b>, which can be formed everywhere on the crystalline surface of the second component and the third component, also have the effect of promoting the chemical abrasive action of these components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0084">The size and shape of the integrated particle is determined to those suitable to the polishing. If a surface roughness not more than 0.01 μm is required in lapping process of silicon carbide substrate or gallium nitride substrate, the average particle size should be set not more than 10 μm. When the abrasive particle of the present invention is used in the wet polishing, the desirable average particle size is not less than 0.05 μm and not more than 100 μm. In a case that the abrasive particle is used while being fixed on an abrasive pad or a grinder, the average particle size may become larger than the above. Thus, the abrasive particle of the present invention can meet various level of surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0085">While the abrasive particle is integrated to make a lump, the external shape of each abrasive particle is not necessarily spherical. Several kinds of component are joined together using the mechanical alloying process, while each component maintaining the inherent material properties. The purpose of joining several components is to utilize the inherent material property of each component in the polishing process. In any case, when employing the wet polishing method, the present invention does not use chemical slurry, which includes acid, alkali, or oxidizing agent and the like. Instead, pH neutral water is used as a scattering medium of the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0064" num="0000">&lt;Mechanical Alloying Process&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0086">In the mechanical alloying process, repeated mechanical impacts including fracturing, rubbing, compressing, stretching, hitting, bending, and crashing etc. are given to the mixture of the first component <b>12</b> powder, the second component <b>13</b> powder, and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> powder. Any impact or any combination among these impacts can be applied. By the mechanical impact, these powders are broken and blended with each other evenly. Thereafter, some of the blended powder is integrated. The components are joined each other and integrated into a lump of powder, while maintaining the inherent material properties. These components are joined together through the amorphous layer <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0065" num="0000">&lt;Action of First Component&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0087">The first component <b>12</b> exerts the mechanical abrasive action to the object material. The Mohs' hardness (modified Mohs' hardness) of the first component <b>12</b> is selected according to the rigidity of the object material. For example, when polishing silicon carbide or gallium nitride, appropriate Mohs' hardness of the first component <b>12</b> is not less than 7 and not more than 13. The minimum rigidity level of the first component <b>12</b> for performing the mechanical polishing at high speed is 7. The maximum rigidity level of the first component <b>12</b> for preventing the surface of the object material (silicon carbide or gallium nitride) from being damaged is 13 equal to that of silicon carbide or gallium nitride. Suitable material for the first component <b>12</b> is silicate compound including SiC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, talc, or mica. Silicate salt compound is not restricted to the above. Other silicate compounds are also applicable. In order to attain a high polishing rate, SiC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, or ZrO<sub>2</sub>, whose modified Mohs' hardness is not less than 9 and not more than 13, are suitable. On the other hand, in order to obtain a high quality of polishing surface, softer silicate compound such as talc and mica, whose modified Mohs' hardness is less than 9, are suitable. Note that, to polish sapphire, whose Mohs' hardness is 9, the suitable Mohs' hardness of abrasive particle is not less than 7 and not more than 9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0088">Assuming that the whole weight of the integrated abrasive particle is 100% by weight, it is desirable that the weight of the first component <b>12</b> is not less than 5% and not more than 95% by weight. Note that if the ratio of the first component <b>12</b> is less than 5% by weight, the rigidity of the abrasive particle can become insufficient. Further, if the ratio of the first component <b>12</b> is more than 95% by weight, the amount of the second component <b>13</b> which exerts the chemical abrasive action can become insufficient. As the result, the polishing rate may not be improved sufficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0066" num="0000">&lt;Action of Second Component&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0089">The second component <b>13</b> acts to induce the mechanochemical effect to the object material. The mechanochemical effect includes at least severing the bindings between molecules or atoms, oxidizing molecules or atoms, replacing some of molecules or atoms with others, on the surface of the object material. In this way, the surface of the object material is altered chemically. This makes possible to strip off the chemically altered part of the object material by using the abrasive particle having rigidity level equal to or lower than that of the object material. Thus, the surface of the object material is polished to be flat. Therein, a large scarring will not be left on the object material, since only the outer surface is stripped off. This action of the second component helps to attain a high polishing rate (removal amount per unit time) in the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0090">To polish silicon carbide or gallium nitride, it is desirable to employ one or more kinds of oxide material as the second component <b>13</b>, from the following materials such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, NiO, SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CuO, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, and MnO<sub>2</sub>. This means that the second component <b>13</b> is oxide material or multiple oxide material of transition metal element, which belongs to the third to the eleventh group of the periodic table except Zr, otherwise oxide or multiple oxide material of the twelfth group element (zinc group element) of the periodic table. Multiple oxide material is solid solution of more than two kinds of oxide materials among of the above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0091">Oxide materials capable of easily oxidizing silicon carbide or gallium nitride at a high temperature can be employed as the second component <b>13</b>. Any of the above listed second components <b>13</b> is oxide material. Manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) is widely known as the solid oxidizing agent having a strong activity. MnO<sub>2 </sub>produced through an electrolytic process is especially suitable as the second component. In response to the friction heat generated during the polishing process, MnO<sub>2 </sub>oxidizes the C surface of silicon carbide and causes solid phase reaction with the Si surface. In this way, the oxidized polishing surface can be removed mechanically by the component whose Mohs' hardness is equal to or lower than that of silicon carbide, with a great efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0092">To polish sapphire, it is desirable to employ, as the second component <b>13</b>, a material which is easy to be isomorphic-replaced with aluminum ion (Al<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>) of sapphire and whose ionic radius is approximate to that of aluminum (Al). On the other hand, Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is isomorphic-replaced when the siloxane is dehydrated. In response to this chemical reaction, the surface of the object material (i.e. sapphire) is altered. Thus, an efficient polishing by using the first abrasive agent having even or lower rigidity than that of the object material becomes possible. Assuming that the whole weight of the integrated particle is 100, the desirable ratio of the second component <b>13</b> is not less than 5 and not more than 95% by weight. Note that when if second component <b>13</b> is less than 5% by weight, the amount of the second component which exerts the chemical abrasive action can become insufficient. As the result, the polishing rate may not be improved sufficiently. Further, if the second component <b>13</b> is more than 95% by weight, the rigidity of the entire abrasive particle can become insufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0067" num="0000">&lt;Action of Reaction Promoter&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0093">The reaction promoter <b>14</b> is produced from alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt. Further, the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is insoluble to the pure water used in the slurry. The reaction promoter <b>14</b> is not liquid but solid state material. Therefore, the reaction promoter <b>14</b> can be integrated with the first component <b>12</b> and the second component <b>13</b> by the mechanical energy to produce the joined abrasive particle. If the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is liquid state or water-soluble material, the abrasive particles will dissolve into the slurry and then make the liquid-waste harmful.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0094">It is desirable to select, as the material of the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, one or more kinds of materials from the following material group: CaCO<sub>3</sub>, SrCO<sub>3</sub>, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, LiCo<sub>3</sub>, Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. These materials, which are suitable for reaction promoter <b>14</b>, are alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt and also insoluble to pure water. Any of them is capable of promoting the chemical polishing action of the second component <b>13</b> with friction heat generated during the polishing process. Other than the above, inorganic compounds of such materials as CaF<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, AgCl, AgBr, AgI, which are stable in atmosphere and insoluble to pure water, are also suitable to the material of the reaction promoter <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0095">Specifically, the materials (except for LiCo<sub>3 </sub>and AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) to be employed for the reaction promoter <b>14</b> have water solubility of not more than 0.1. In other words, the amount to be dissolved in 100 g of pure water at a temperature of 25° C. is not more than 0.1 g. On the other hand, LiCo<sub>3 </sub>and AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>have water solubility (i.e. 1.33 and 6.74 respectively) higher than the other materials mentioned the above. However, in the present embodiment, since the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is integrated with the other components in the abrasive particle using the mechanical alloying process, the integrated particles are hardly separated and dissolved into water. Accordingly, the abrasive particle including the reaction promoter <b>14</b> can be used repeatedly in slurry. Note that the insoluble material in the present invention means the material which cannot dissolve more than 7.0 g in 100 g of pure water at a temperature of 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0096">Assuming that the whole weight of the integrated particle is 100, it is preferable that the ratio of the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is not less than 5 and not more than 95% by weight. When the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is less than 5% by weight, the chemical polishing action of the second component <b>13</b> cannot be promoted sufficiently. When the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is more than 95% by weight, the amount of the second component <b>13</b> becomes insufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0097">Considering the case where lithium carbonate or alkali carbonate is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>. When the wet polishing is performed with the abrasive particle of the present invention, the abrasive particle is rubbed against the object material and friction heat is generated at the place subject to the rubbing. As the result, carbon dioxide is separated from the lithium carbonate or the alkali carbonate to yield oxidized lithium or oxidized alkali. Thereafter, the oxidized lithium or the oxidized alkali immediately reacts to water while generating high hydration heat. As the result, lithium hydroxide or alkaline-earth hydroxide, which is strong alkaline material, is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0098">This chemical reaction occurs in a minute area of the surface of the object material, where the object material comes into contact with the abrasive particle. Since the abrasive particle includes both of the component for inducing the mechanochemical effect and the component capable of exerting mechanical polishing action, the mechanochemical effect and the mechanical polishing action are exerted serially. As the result, the polishing surface can be removed effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0099">When alum (AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, acid areas for prompting the mechanochemical effect are formed on the surface of the object material by the friction heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0100">When fluorine compound or halogen compound is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, it is considered that the following reactions occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0101">Near the surface of the object material of Si system, atoms are in a state called dangling bond. Since the atom which is in the state of dangling bond has electrons which are not covalently-bonded, the electrons become instable and chemically active. On the other hands, when the abrasive particle is rubbed against the surface of the object material, fluorine ion is yielded due to the friction heat. Then, the atom which is in the state of dangling bond and the fluorine ion are bonded together. Consequently, the fluorine atoms having strong electronegativity warp the crystalline structure of the surface of the object material. In this way, the mechanochemical effect on the surface of the object material is promoted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0068" num="0000">&lt;Polishing Device&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0102"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an approximately perspective view showing a polishing device in which the abrasive particle of the present invention is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0103">A surface plate <b>20</b> is rotationally driven in the direction of arrow <b>32</b>. The top surface of the surface plate <b>20</b> is covered with an abrasive pad <b>22</b>. A holding device <b>24</b> holds the object material (silicon carbide substrate or gallium nitride substrate) by pressing the object material <b>26</b> against the abrasive pad <b>22</b>. In the present invention, the abrasive particles are provided from a liquid pourer <b>28</b> with the slurry in the direction of arrow <b>30</b>. The object material <b>26</b> pressed against the surface of the abrasive pad <b>22</b> comes into contact with the abrasive particles and is polished. During the polishing process, the abrasive particles and the slurry are continually provided by a prescribed quantity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0104">For example, the abrasive particles of the present invention can be utilized to polish sapphire substrate, or silicon carbide or gallium nitride substrate used for a power device. The modified Mohs' hardness of sapphire substrate is 9, and that of silicon carbide or gallium nitride is 13. In the polishing process, the object material is polished until its surface roughness reaches 0.010 μm or lower, for example. In the polishing process, suspension (slurry) is provided on the polishing surface. The slurry is produced by scattering the abrasive particles into pure water. Surface active agent or chelate agent may be added to the water in order to help the abrasive particle scattering in the water. As described later, the pH of the slurry is set to a value not less than 4 and not more than 11 at a temperature of 25° C. This means that the pH range of the slurry can be limited between weak acidity and weak alkaline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0105">Generally, a polishing process starts from a crude processing, where both surfaces of the substrate are polished to arrange the basic shape. Then, in a middle processing, scarring left in the crude process are decreased. Finally, in a finishing processing, the surfaces are polished until the surface flatness reaches atomic precision level. Conventionally, diamond particles are employed to polish the substrate of silicon carbide or gallium nitride in the crude processing, in order to attain a possible highest polishing rate. However, the diamond particles, which have Vickers hardness higher than that of silicon carbide or gallium nitride, make deep saw marks on the substrate. In order to repair the saw marks, the middle processing over a long period of time is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0106">It is considered to use fine diamond particles to avoid leaving the saw marks. However, when the finer particles are used in the mechanical polishing, the polishing rate becomes lower. Furthermore, making the finer diamond particles increases the production cost. Accordingly, the way to improve the polishing speed while preventing damage on the object surface has not been established yet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0107">The present invention resolves the above problem. Since a sufficient level of polishing rate is secured by using the abrasive particles of the present invention, it is possible to conduct the crude processing and the middle processing at the same time. In the abrasive particles of the present invention, the component <b>3</b>, whose rigidity level is equal to or lower than that of silicon carbide or gallium nitride substrate, is contained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0108">In the polishing process, the slurry, where the abrasive particles of the present invention are scattered in 100 ml of pure water with 15% by weight, is used. The pH of the slurry is not less than 4 and not more than 11 at a temperature of 25° C. It is found from experiments that even after the polishing process has been performed for four hours, the pH value of the liquid-waste stays around 8. Desirable pH of the liquid-waste is not less than 5 and not more than 9. When materials other than LiCo<sub>3 </sub>and Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>are employed as the reaction promotor <b>14</b>, the pH of the liquid-waste falls into this range. When LiCo<sub>3 </sub>or Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, the pH value becomes 10 to 11. In any case of the above, the pH of the liquid-waste falls into the range between weak acidity and weak alkaline. Accordingly, it is prevented to badly affect the working environment and the liquid-waste treatment becomes easy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0109">Preferably, the abrasive particles are put into the slurry with 5% by weight for to 100% of pure water, and the apparent specific volume (in standing) of the abrasive particles are adjusted to equal to or more than 0.5 ml/g and equal to or less than 200 ml/g. If the apparent specific volume (in standing) is less than 0.5 ml/g, the components of the abrasive particles can be separated from each other. On the other hand, even when the apparent specific volume (in standing) is more than 200 ml/g, the polishing rate is not increased. Further, since the amount of the abrasive particles is too much, a lot of abrasive particles can settle down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0110">In the device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the object material <b>26</b> is pressed against the surface of the abrasive pad <b>22</b> with elasticity, friction heat can be easily generated between the abrasive particles scattered on the surface of the abrasive pad <b>22</b> and the object material <b>26</b>. For this purpose, the holding device <b>24</b> is preferably made of elastic material such as a rubber plate and the like. The abrasive pad <b>22</b> is preferably formed from synthetic fiber, glass fiber, natural fiber, synthetic resin, natural resin and the like. Since the holding device <b>24</b> gives proper elastic force to the object material <b>26</b>, friction heat is effectively generated. As the result, high polishing rate is achieved. The friction heat, which is generated between the abrasive particle and the object material <b>26</b>, is preferably higher than the temperature at which the reaction promoter <b>14</b> brings the chemical reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0111">At the early time of startup of the polishing device, as friction heat has not enough accumulated there, the temperature at the surface of the object material <b>26</b> is also insufficient. This lowers the polishing rate of the polishing device. In this case, a device for adjusting the temperature of the slurry may be installed into the polishing device. The abrasive particle of the present invention can also be used in the dry polishing. For example, when the abrasive pad is employed as a base material, abrasive member can be produced by scattering and fixing the abrasive particles into resin or fiber at an appropriate density. When a plastic molding product is employed as the base material, in order to make abrasive member, abrasive member can be produced by solidifying, in a predetermined way, the abrasive particles and unsolid plastic which are mixed in advance. Further, a stripe of tape on which the abrasive particles are scattered and fixed can also be employed as the base material. Although the abrasive member is suitable for a dry polishing, it can also be employed in a wet polishing with providing pure water to the polishing surface during the polishing process.</div>

In the abrasive particles shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, several kinds of abrasive agent are mixed. Abrasive agents A <b>16</b> and abrasive agents B <b>18</b> are mixed in the slurry and provided to the polishing device. The abrasive agent B <b>18</b> functions to promote the polishing action of the abrasive agent A <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the abrasive agents A <b>16</b> and the abrasive agents B <b>18</b> are separated with each other in the slurry, since both abrasive agents are different in specific gravity.</div>

In this method, the above mentioned problem is solved, so it is widely employed recently. However, in this method, since strong alkali material or oxidizing agent is used in the slurry <b>17</b>, the slurry <b>17</b> has high corrosive property. Therefore, the slurry <b>17</b> may deteriorate the working environment and increase the liquid-waste treatment cost.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, various sizes of abrasive particles exist. The average particle size is 5 to 6 μm. The particles having the size of about 1 μm are also included. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a partial enlarged view of the abrasive particle having outer diameter of about 6 μm in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Three kinds of components, where each of them is grinded in advance, are mixed and strongly integrated with each other. The components are integrated, while maintaining the inherent chemical and the physical properties respectively. In the abrasive particle of the present embodiment, the components are integrated not so as to be separated from each other even after the polishing process. Even after four hours of polishing of silicon carbide, the surface state of the abrasive particle is almost the same as the state shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0117">The abrasive particle of the first embodiment is made by integrating aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), and calcium carbide (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), with the following ratio; 50%, 37.5%, and 12.5% in weight. Specifically, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), and calcium carbide (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) are grinded through ball milling method until the particles become to have outer diameter of 1 μm or shorter; then the abrasive particles are given by continuously mechanically impacting aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), and calcium carbide (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) for 0.5 hours. Thereafter, the abrasive particles having an average particle size of 1 μm are screened. The above-obtained abrasive particle and pure water are provided to the polishing device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and then silicon carbide substrate is polished for four hours. During the polishing process, the slurry including the abrasive particles is continually provided on abrasive pad <b>22</b> and then successively discharged.

Then, the abrasive particles having average particle size of 2 μm are screened. Even after the polishing process for sapphire substrate is performed for four hours, the abrasive particle can also be reusable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0119">For example, the way to join several kinds of inorganic compound using adhesive agent such as resin is known. However, when the joined inorganic compound is subject to the external forces occurred in polishing process, the binding power of the resin adhesive is not strong enough to prevent the joint from separating. Otherwise, a way to sinter the compounds to join with each other is considered. However, when sintered, each compound loses most of its inherent material properties. As the result, the polishing rate is not improved in contrast to the abrasive particle of the present invention. Further, the compounds are subject to a heat of about 1000° C. in the sintering process. Therefore, the compounds maybe altered or broken with the heat of sintering. On the other hands, in the mechanical alloying process of the present invention, the compounds are not subject to such a high heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0120">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, in the abrasive particle of the embodiment, each component is evenly mixed. Therefore, each component is partially exposed to the outer surface of the abrasive particle. The abrasive particle moves rolling and contacts the object material <b>26</b>. When successively coming into contact with the object material, the abrasive particle itself generates frictional heat. The chemical abrasive agent in the abrasive particle is heated directly by the friction heat. This, in turn, induces the mechanochemical effect on the surface of the object material <b>26</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, when the abrasive particle moves rolling on the object material <b>26</b>, the component for mechanically polishing the object surface <b>26</b> promptly comes into contact with the part where mechanochemical effect is induced. Then that part of the object material <b>26</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0121">When the abrasive particle moves rolling along the surface of the object material <b>26</b>, the object surface alternately and repeatedly contacts with the chemically reactive component and the component for mechanically polishing the object surface. Before the friction heat diffuses into the slurry, these components and the object surface promptly contacts with each other. Thus, the polishing process proceeds successively and efficiently. Note that whole of the abrasive particle can be coated with any of the above components. In this case, the coated components are not exposed to the outer surface. However, once the coating breaks and the coated components are exposed, the same action as the above occurs. Further, all components may not be exposed to the outer surface, as long as the coating has a thickness which does not disturb the other components' action.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0122">If the chemically reactive component and the mechanically polishing component are dispersed in the slurry, the mechanically polishing component is quite unlikely to come into contact with the part of the object surface on which mechanochemical effect is induced. This may delays the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0123">On the other hands, if the mechanochemical effect is induced evenly on the whole surface of the object material <b>26</b>, any part of the surface can be mechanically polished. For this reason, the method for inducing the mechanochemical effect on the whole surface of the object material <b>26</b> by using the slurry produced from strong alkaline solution is employed as the most practical way for polishing. However, in this method, the liquid-waste treatment would cause a trouble, as explained before.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0072" num="0000">&lt;Analysis of Abrasive Particle after Polishing Process&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0125"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a table showing a comparison of components ratio of the abrasive particle before/after polishing silicon carbide substrate for four hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0126">The upper section of the table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a ratio of each component in the abrasive particle before performing the polishing process and the lower section shows a ratio of each component in the abrasive particle after performing the polishing process. Before and after the polishing process, there is not any significant change in the ratio of the components. Judging from this result and the external shape of the components, it is found that most of the combined components extracted from the slurry after the four hours of polishing maintain the original shape. This means that since the abrasive particle of the present invention has high mechanical strength and not be broken in a polishing process, so it can be used repeatedly. Note that it is also found that about 3% of the total weight of the abrasive particle is consumed in the chemical reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a table showing a comparison of components ratio of the abrasive particle before/after polishing sapphire substrate for four hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0128">The ratio of each component to the whole abrasive particle is found to be: aluminum (Al) 38.2% by weight, silicon (Si) 43.8% by weight, and calcium (Ca) 17.9% byweight, before the polishing process. After the polishing process, this becomes as follows; 41.2% by weight, 42.3% by weight, and 16.5% by weight, respectively. While the ratio of aluminum increases, those of the other two components are almost unchanged throughout the polishing process. The reason for the increase of aluminum is considered that aluminum is separated from sapphire in the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0129">When the components of residue, which is discharged with slurry after the polishing process, is analyzed, the ratio of each component to the whole residue is found to be: aluminum (Al) 52% by weight, silicon (Si) 33% by weight, and calcium (Ca) 0.5% by weight, and further mullite is found to be contained there.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0130">It is studied whether mullite is yield due to mechanical resolution or heat resolution of the abrasive particle or otherwise due to the other factors. The amount of mullite is proportional to the time length of the polishing process, and it also considerably exceeds the amount of the abrasive particle consumed during the polishing process. This means that the mullite is a residue of the object material <b>26</b> produced when the abrasive particles polish the object material <b>26</b> while chemically altering the surface of the object material <b>26</b>. In any of the conventional wet polishing methods, this amount of mullite is not produced after four hours of polishing process. Therefore, it is proven that reaction promoter <b>14</b> has acted properly during the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0131">Mullite, which is a compound of aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide, is expressed by the following chemical formula: 3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2SiO<sub>2 </sub>to 2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>, or Al<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, it is considered that calcium carbonate prompts the reaction between object material <b>26</b> and aluminum oxide, where mullite is yielded consequently. When the abrasive particle of the present invention and the object material <b>26</b> are rubbed against each other, the friction heat is generated. The heat becomes hundreds of centigrade partially. Although the friction heat is diffused into slurry, it makes some minute area of high temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0132"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a comparison of properties of liquid-waste drained after the polishing process with various abrasive particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0133">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, it is found that the temperature of the slurry drained after the polishing process rises up to 30 to 40° C. from room temperature. Therefore, it is confirmed that reaction promoter works to give some effect in the slurry. The liquid-waste of slurry consists of water and residues which are shavings of the silicon carbide substrate or the gallium nitride substrate. Since the residues are solid elements, they can be removed from the liquid-waste by using a filter. In most samples, the pH range of the liquid-waste stays around 7.5, and even the highest pH is 11.2, although the pH of the liquid-waste depends on the kind of the reaction promoter <b>14</b> to some extent. Thus, since the liquid-waste is pH neutral, the treatment of the liquid-waste is easy and harmless.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0134">When the abrasive particle in which Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and CaCO<sub>3 </sub>are integrated is used for polishing sapphire, high polishing rate (0.7 to 1.0 μm per minute) is attained. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, when materials other than LiCo<sub>3 </sub>and Ca<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>are employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, the pH value of the slurry falls into the range of 4.63 to 8.0 before the polishing process and into the range of 4.2 to 8.2 after the polishing process. When either LiCo<sub>3 </sub>or Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, pH value of each slurry is 10.1 and 9.0 respectively before the polishing process and 11.2 and 9.6 respectively after the polishing process. It is found that since only limited minimum area becomes high alkali atmosphere at high temperature, it scarcely affects pH of the slurry. Thus, in any of the above cases, since pH of the slurry stays in the range between weak acidity and weak alkaline, bad effects to working environment can be avoided, and the liquid-waste treatment becomes easy.</div>

Operation condition of the polishing device <b>24</b> is set as follows; rotating speed of the abrasive plate <b>20</b> is 50 rpm, rotating speed of the holding device <b>24</b> is 100 rpm; polishing pressure at which the holding device <b>24</b> presses the object material <b>26</b> against the abrasive plate <b>20</b> is 160 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; where 15% by weight of the abrasive particle is contained into pure water. The obtained slurry is provided on the abrasive pad <b>22</b> from the liquid pourer <b>28</b> at the rate of 1 ml/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0152">In “ref 1”, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) alone is employed as the abrasive particle. In “ref 2”, silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) alone is employed as the abrasive particle. In “ref 3”, calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) alone is employed as the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0153">In “ref 4”, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) , which are mechanically combined and integrated in the same way as the present invention, are employed as the abrasive particle. In “ref 5”, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which are mechanically combined and integrated in the same way as the present invention, are employed as the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0154">In “ref 6”, silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) , which are mechanically combined and integrated in the same way as the present invention, are employed as the abrasive particle. In “ref 7”, the mixture of compound of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which are not integrated each other, are employed as the abrasive particle. In “ref 8”, the diamond particle having average particle size of 1 to 3 μm is employed as the abrasive particle. In any of the above examples, a resin pad is employed as the abrasive pad <b>22</b> and the slurry is produced by scattering the abrasive particles into pure water. On the other hand, in “ref 9”, the diamond particle having the average particle size of 1 to 3 μm, a steel plate, and oil slurry are employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0155">Polishing rates of all the above examples are compared in here. While 1.0 μm per minute of the polishing rate is obtained in sample 1, the polishing rate cannot exceed 0.3 μm in any of comparative “ref 1” to “ref 8”. Although “ref 9” is known to have the highest polishing rate among conventional ways, its polishing rate is 0.8 μm per minute, which is below that of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0156">In samples 1 and 2, higher polishing rate than that of any other conventional ways is achieved. In sample 3, the same level of the polishing rate as “ref 9” is achieved. In any of samples 1 to 3, the working environment is not deteriorated since pure water is employed as the scattering medium, which makes it is easy to handle the liquid-waste. If a steel plate is used for the polishing process, the surface of the steel plate has to be made as flat as that of the object material <b>26</b> of sapphire. However, it is not such an easy thing. On the other hand, in the present invention, the surface of the object material <b>26</b> is polished by the abrasive particle pressed against the surface of the object material <b>26</b> by the resin pad. Therefore, a precision structure is not required for the polishing device. Additionally, the resin pad is low-priced and easily maintainable. This is advantageous to the conventional way using the steel plate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0160"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> indicates that, in all samples except comparative example 1, the temperature of the slurry after the polishing process is more than 30° C.

In other words, the higher the temperature of the slurry, the more actively the reaction promoter <b>14</b> reacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0161">In comparative example 1, the polishing rate is 0.31 μm/min and the temperature of the slurry after the polishing process is 27° C. When the result of comparative example 1 is compared to the others, it is found that the heat generated in the chemical reaction of the reaction promoter <b>14</b> raises the temperature of the slurry as well as the friction heat. Additionally, it is proven that, as shown in samples 11 to 18, the integrated abrasive particle of the first component <b>12</b>, the second component <b>13</b>, and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> increases the polishing rate drastically. As to the polishing of gallium nitride, since the action of reaction promoter <b>14</b> is the same as the above, the illustration is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0162">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the relationship between the polishing rate and the temperature of the slurry after the polishing process is illustrated. In experimental examples 1 to 8, with the integrated abrasive particle of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(first abrasive agent) and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(second abrasive agent), where the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is selected one by one from among various component samples. Any of the abrasive particles of the examples has the following component ratio; 50% by weight of the first abrasive agent; 37.5% by weight of the second abrasive agent, and 12.5% by weight of the reaction promoter. Sapphire wafer having the surface roughness Ra 0.22 μm, which is polished with GC (green carbonate) having the average particle size #325, is employed as the object material <b>26</b>. The temperature of the slurry before the polishing process is 25° C. Under the above polishing conditions, the temperature of the slurry after polishing the sapphire substrate for an hour is measured. The polishing rate is a polishing amount per minute. The polishing rate is obtained by measuring the thickness of the object material <b>26</b> after the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0163">In “ref 1”, the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is not contained in the abrasive particle.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0164">In any of examples 1 to 8, it is indicated that the temperature of the slurry after the polishing process is equal to or more than 30° C.

The higher the temperature of the slurry, the higher the polishing rate is. In other words, the higher the temperature of the slurry, the more actively the reaction promoter <b>14</b> reacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0165">In “ref 1”, the polishing rate is 0.40 μm/min and the temperature of the slurry after the polishing process is 27° C.

However, in both samples, the polishing rate is not high enough. Therefore, it is proven that only the abrasive particle of the present invention in which the first abrasive agent, the second abrasive agent, and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> are integrated with each other can increase the polishing rate sufficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0079" num="0000">&lt;Reason for Increase of Polishing Rate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0166">Here, the reasons why the abrasive particle of the present invention can improve the polishing rate drastically will be described in sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0167">(1) Reason why the first component <b>12</b>, whose modified Mohs' hardness is 13 or lower, is included in the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0168">Each of ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and SiC has a modified Mohs' hardness equal to or less than 13. These components help to form the plastic deformation layer (amorphous layer) by applying physical force to silicon carbide or gallium nitride. After the plastic deformation layer is altered by the machnochemical effect induced by the second component, the first component mechanically removes the altered plastic deformation layer. When the plastic deformation layer is formed on the object material <b>26</b>, the crystalline structure of the part is destroyed. Therefore, the mechanochemical effect is likely to be induced by the second component. When the plastic deformation layer is altered, it becomes easy to remove the altered plastic deformation layer with the first component whose hardness is lower than that of the object material <b>26</b>. This action is also applied when sapphire is employed as the object material <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0169">The modified Mohs' hardness of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is 9, while that of ZrSiO<sub>4 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>is 8. Since the modified Mohs' hardness of any of these abrasive particles is lower than that of silicon carbide or gallium nitride, it can be restrained that these abrasive particles leave saw marks on the surface of the object material <b>26</b>. Since Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is harder than ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, the abrasive particle including Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>have higher polishing rate than the abrasive particle including ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0170">(2) Reason why the second component <b>13</b>, which induces the mechanochemical effect, is included in the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0171">Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, NiO, SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CuO, CO<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, and MnO<sub>2 </sub>are components which induce the mechanochemical effect. Any of them is likely to yield the oxidation reaction with silicon carbide or gallium nitride under high temperature atmosphere. They are also likely to yield the solid phase reaction. It is considered that, by these chemical reactions, the surface of the object material <b>26</b> such as silicon carbide or gallium nitride is altered, as mentioned in the prior art documents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0172">Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, FeO<sub>3 </sub>or SiO<sub>2 </sub>is employed as the mechanochemical abrasive agent for sapphire. These abrasive agents are likely to operate the isomorphous substitution with sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). In the isomorphous substitution, ion clusters having approximate ionic radius are replaced with each other, when pressure or heat are provided from external.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0173">Fe<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> (ionic radius of 0.55 Å (angstrom)) of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>having six-coordination construction or Cr<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> (ionic radius of 0.62 Å) of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>having six-coordination construction has ionic radius closed to Al<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> (ionic radius of 0.54 Å) of sapphire having six-coordination construction. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution occurs between these ion clusters. Due to this chemical reaction, it is considered that the polishing surface of sapphire is altered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0174">On the other hands, the chemical reaction of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is explained as below; when SiO<sub>4 </sub>having tetrahedron construction and including silanol group (Si—OH) is connected with each other in a dehydration condensation reaction, Al<sub>3+</sub> (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) participates the reaction. Then, SiO<sub>4 </sub>is put into the crystalline structure of sapphire; where, inside the connected body of SiO<sub>4</sub>, six-coordination Si4+ (ionic radius of 0.40 Å) is replaced with four-coordination Al3<sup>+</sup> (ionic radius of 0.39 Å). This chemical reaction of isomorphous substitution is considered to deform the polishing surface of sapphire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0175">(3) Reason why the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is included in the abrasive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0176">The chemical reaction occurring when calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is employed as the reaction promoter <b>14</b> is explained here. Calcium carbonate is broken into CaO and CO<sub>2</sub>, due to the friction heat generated between the abrasive particle and the surface of silicon carbide or gallium nitride when both materials are rubbed with each other. Further, when the friction heat rises up to several hundred centigrade, calcium oxide (CaO) reacts to water while generating heat. As the result, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH<sub>2</sub>)) is generated. This reaction occurs in a very limited minimum area, where silicon carbide or gallium nitride and the abrasive particle are come into contact with each other. This reaction alters the surface of silicon carbide or gallium nitride, and simultaneously the chemical reaction such as the mechanochemical effect is accelerated on the object material, at high temperature of strong alkaline atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0177">As explained above, the abrasive particle forms the plastic deformation layer on the object surface of silicon carbide or gallium nitride and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> forms strong alkaline atmosphere on the plastic deformation layer to promote the mechanochemical effect. Due to the friction heat generated there, the temperature of the slurry after the polishing becomes 30 to 40° C. The strong alkaline atmosphere is formed on very limited areas around the abrasive particle. Therefore, the strong alkaline atmosphere hardly affects the pH value of the whole slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0178">The same reaction is observed when SrCO<sub>3</sub>, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, BaCO<sub>3 </sub>etc. are employed. The above reaction occurs quite partially. The pH value of the slurry after the polishing process slightly rises from the neutral pH of 7. Even when the surface of silicon carbide or gallium nitride is altered by the second component <b>13</b>, the polishing rate will not increase if the first component <b>12</b> does not contact the altered portion precisely. Accordingly, when the abrasive particle and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> exist separately in the slurry as in conventional ways, sufficiently high polishing rate cannot be attained. On the other hand, in the abrasive particle of the present invention, since the first component <b>12</b>, the second component <b>13</b> and the reaction promoter <b>14</b> are combined and integrated each other, it is possible to obtain the above mentioned results. In the present invention, it becomes possible to polish silicon carbide or gallium nitride through the wet polishing method at sufficiently high polishing rate. As the result, it becomes possible to obtain a high quality of polishing surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0179"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the relationships between the polishing pressure and the polishing rate of samples 1 to 3. This is to confirm a change in polishing rate when different strength of polishing pressure is applied. The experimental result is based on three different arrangements of polishing pressure, at which the holding device <b>24</b> presses the object material <b>26</b> against the abrasive plate <b>20</b>. The three arrangements of polishing pressure to be applied to each sample are as follows; 500 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, 750 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 1000 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. The other experimental conditions are as follows; rotating speed of the abrasive plate <b>20</b> of is 50 rpm, rotating speed of the carrier is 100 rpm; 15% by weight of the abrasive particle is contained in the slurry; the slurry is supplied to the device 10 ml/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0180">According to the result, when the polishing pressure is increased, the polishing rate of SiC substrate is also improved. In the case of sample 1, for example, when the polishing pressure is set at 500 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, the polishing rate becomes 0.72 μm/min. Whereas, when the polishing pressure is set at 1000 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, the polishing rate becomes 1.39 μm/min, i.e. which is improved by two times. Further, even when the polishing pressure is set at 1000 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>to polish silicon carbide substrate, 0.003 μm of surface roughness is obtained, without leaving any saw mark.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0181">It is proven from this example that, by increasing the polishing pressure, more friction heat is generated and then the abrasive particle polishes the surface of the object material <b>26</b> more efficiently. Any abrasive particles of samples 1 to 3 can polish the surface of the object material <b>26</b> with high quality, at higher speed than any other conventional ones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0182"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the relationships between the polishing rates of various combined particles and the surface roughness. In this example, the polishing rate and the surface roughness of the object material <b>26</b> for each of various combined particle are indicated, where pure water based slurry is used. To make a comparison, the relationships between the polishing rate and the surface roughness when each of SiO<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, and TiO<sub>2 </sub>and also diamond alone are employed as the abrasive particle are included. In polishing SiC, the polishing rate of materials other than diamond is quite low, which is not for a practical use. In the present invention, even when the pure water based slurry is used, any sample shows polishing rate higher than that of the diamond particle. Further, the surface roughness of SiC substrate after the polishing process is significantly low. In other words, high quality of polishing surface is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0183"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the relationships between the polishing rate and the surface roughness of various combined particles. In this example, SiC substrate is polished with the abrasive particle of SiO<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, or TiO<sub>2</sub>, where oxidizing agent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is included in the slurry. Compared to the result of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the polishing rates are improved slightly. Yet, these polishing rate are still low and not for a practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0184"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a comparative diagram of the polishing rates and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a comparative diagram of the surface roughness after the polishing process, the experimental results of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> being reflected on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, respectively. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the abrasive particle of the present invention has the same or higher level of the polishing rate, compared to that of the diamond particle. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the surface roughness made with the abrasive particle of the present invention has much higher quality than that made with the diamond particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0185">As explained before, the area where the reaction promoter <b>14</b> generates the friction heat and the area where manganese dioxide exerts oxidation effect are extremely small. Further, the duration when these effects have been occurring is quite short. If the reaction promoter <b>14</b>, oxidizing agent, and the mechanical abrasive agent are dispersed in the slurry and alternately come into contact with the surface of the object material <b>26</b> at irregular long interval, mutual action of these components cannot be achieved. However, in the present invention, immediately after the oxidation effect of the second component <b>13</b> is accelerated due to the friction heat, the first component <b>12</b> comes into contact with that oxidized area. With this mutual action, the efficient polishing can be conducted. This is why the present invention employs combined and integrated abrasive particle. Moreover, this is the revolutionary way of the present invention by which such a high polishing rate is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0186">Through the present invention, high flatness level of polishing surface is achieved, while the middle process for polishing the surface of the object material <b>26</b> is shortened. This, in turn, helps to reduce the finishing process drastically. Accordingly, it becomes possible to significantly decline the cost in the polishing process, which occupies major part of the total production cost of this type of substrate. Additionally, in stead of strong acid solution or strong alkaline solution, water based pH neutral slurry is employed as the scattering medium of the abrasive particle, so the liquid-waste becomes weak acid or weak alkaline, which does not affect the environment badly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0187">In the above example of the present invention, sapphire, silicon carbide, or gallium nitride is employed as the object material <b>26</b>. However, the object material <b>26</b> is not limited to these materials and other materials can also be polished greatly, at a high speed. Also, in the abrasive particle of the embodiment, two or three kinds of inorganic components are integrated. However, even if four or more kinds of inorganic components may be integrated each other through the amorphous layer, similar functions can be obtained. The ratio and combination of the compounds can be selected freely, depending on the material of the object material <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0188">In the embodiment, only one kind of the first component <b>12</b> and only one kind of the second component <b>13</b> are selected, or only one kind of the first component <b>12</b>, only one kind of the second component <b>13</b> and only one kind of the third component <b>14</b> are selected. However, for example, one kind of the first component <b>12</b> can be combined with two kinds of the second components <b>12</b>. In short, various kinds of each component can be combined together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0189">The abrasive particle of the present invention can be widely employed to polish sapphire, silicon carbide, or gallium nitride, which is used in the substrates for the power device, the electronic device material, the electrical insulation material, and the like. The abrasive particle of the present invention can be widely employed for polishing those materials with a high quality; metal, ceramic, biomaterial such as artificial bone, and further hard material such as tungsten. There, the polishing process is significantly shortened and the production cost can be reduced drastically, when it is compared to the case employing the conventional polishing methods.
