<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer polishing method and a semiconductor wafer polishing apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor wafers are usually polished through a plurality of processing steps. Specifically, the processing steps mainly include rough polishing for providing a high flatness to semiconductor wafers and finish polishing for reducing surface roughness. Techniques have been suggested to polish semiconductor wafers with a high accuracy (see, for instance, Patent Literature 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A double-side polishing apparatus used for a method according to Patent Literature 1 includes a light emitter that emits a parallel beam and a light receiver that receives the parallel beam, the light emitter and the light receiver being provided on an internal gear in a manner facing each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a double-side polishing apparatus, when a carrier and a semiconductor wafer held in a carrier hole of the carrier enter a beam transmittable area between the light emitter and the light receiver, the carrier and the semiconductor wafer, which are exposed on upper and lower platens, are irradiated with the parallel beam. The shade of the semiconductor wafer irradiated with the parallel beam is detected by the beam receiver, and a thickness of the shade is directly measured as a thickness of the semiconductor wafer. When the beam receiver detects that the thickness of the shade reaches a target value, the rotation of each of the upper and lower platens is stopped.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: JP-A-11-285969</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The technique according to Patent Literature 1 requires measurement during polishing, so that measurement accuracy is lowered by disturbance due to, for instance, the vibration of a polishing apparatus, the expansion of a fixed portion of the beam emitter and/or the beam receiver due to a change in ambient temperature, and/or drops of a slurry remaining on the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve such a problem, the polished semiconductor wafer taken out of the polishing apparatus may be measured by a form measuring device so that the measurement result is fed back to the next and future polishing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a technique using the form measuring device, however, requires cleaning a measurement surface of the semiconductor wafer by washing and drying it. The cleaned and dried surface is measured by the form measuring device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, any waterdrop remaining on the semiconductor wafer causes, for instance, disturbance of the measurement, and thus lowers the measurement accuracy. Accordingly, an additional processing step is necessary to check whether or not any waterdrop remains. Further, remaining waterdrop(s) needs to be removed by another additional processing step. Such processing steps delay the feedback after the completion of polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor wafer polishing method and a semiconductor wafer polishing apparatus capable of polishing a semiconductor wafer with a high accuracy.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problem(s)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the invention, a semiconductor wafer polishing method includes: polishing a semiconductor wafer; measuring a form of the semiconductor wafer before a polished surface of the semiconductor wafer becomes hydrophilic; and setting polishing conditions for the polishing based on a measurement result of the form of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">When polished, the semiconductor wafer has a hydrophobic polished surface, which becomes hydrophilic after being left in air or water for a predetermined time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The form of the polished semiconductor wafer cannot be measured in the measuring step due to waterdrops remaining on the hydrophilic polished surface of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, the form of the semiconductor wafer is measured before the polished surface of the semiconductor wafer becomes hydrophilic, i.e., when the polished surface is hydrophobic, in the above aspect. The form of the polished semiconductor wafer can thus be highly accurately measured without any measurement error. Further, based on the measurement result, polishing conditions for the next polishing step are set. The measurement result of the polished semiconductor wafer can thus be quickly fed back to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step, thereby manufacturing highly accurate and flat semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above aspect, it is preferable that the semiconductor wafer polishing method further includes: immersing the semiconductor wafer in an organic acid solution after the semiconductor wafer is polished but before the semiconductor wafer is measured; and pulling up the semiconductor wafer from the organic acid solution before an immersion time of the immersing exceeds 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In the above aspect, prior to the measuring step, the polished semiconductor wafer is immersed in the organic acid solution. The surface of the polished semiconductor wafer can be kept hydrophobic by immersing the semiconductor wafer in the organic acid solution. Further, for instance, a polishing slurry remaining on the surface of the polished semiconductor wafer having been rinsed with pure water can be neutralized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The concentration of the organic acid solution used for the immersion is preferably in a range from 0.001 mass % to 10 mass %, more preferably in a range from 0.01 mass % to 1.0 mass %, particularly preferably 0.1 mass %. When the concentration of the organic acid solution is less than 0.001 mass %, the semiconductor wafer cannot have a clean hydrophobic surface, on which waterdrops may remain. In contrast, when the concentration of the organic acid solution is more than 10 mass %, a particulate foreign substance contained in the solution may stick to the surface of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The semiconductor wafer is pulled up from the organic acid solution before the immersion time in the immersing step exceeds 60 minutes. When the immersion time exceeds 60 minutes, the polished surface becomes hydrophilic. In this case, the semiconductor wafer is pulled up from the organic acid solution with waterdrops remaining on the polished surface thereof. Since the semiconductor wafer cannot be measured due to the remaining waterdrops, an additional processing step for removing the waterdrops is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In contrast, when the semiconductor wafer is pulled up from the organic acid solution before the immersion time exceeds 60 minutes, the polished surface is still hydrophobic, and thus no waterdrop remains on the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above aspect, it is preferable that the semiconductor wafer is pulled up at a speed of 100 mm/sec or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above aspect, the semiconductor wafer can be pulled up at a speed of 100 mm/sec or less without any rise of the solution from the level of the solution. Thus, no waterdrop remains on the polished surface of the semiconductor wafer pulled up from the organic acid solution. When the speed exceeds 100 mm/sec, the semiconductor wafer may be pulled up from the organic acid solution with a rise of the solution (i.e., waterdrops) from the level of the solution. Specifically, the semiconductor wafer is preferably pulled up at a speed in a range from 10 mm/sec to 100 mm/sec, particularly preferably in a range from 30 mm/sec to 60 mm/sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the above aspect, it is preferable that the semiconductor wafer is pulled up while kept in a posture with the polished surface of the semiconductor wafer being substantially orthogonal to a horizontal surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above aspect, when the semiconductor wafer is pulled up in a posture with the polished surfaces thereof being substantially orthogonal to the horizontal surface, waterdrops are likely to gravitationally fall off. The waterdrops can thus be quickly removed from the polished surface. Consequently, the process quickly advances to the measuring step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Here, “a posture with the polished surfaces thereof being substantially orthogonal to the horizontal surface” includes not only a posture with the polished surface being precisely orthogonal to the horizontal surface, but also a posture with the polished surface being substantially orthogonal to the horizontal surface with a slight inclination as long as no waterdrop remains on the surface of the semiconductor wafer pulled up from the solution. For instance, the semiconductor wafer may be pulled up in a posture with the polished surface thereof being substantially orthogonal to the horizontal surface with an inclination of approximately five degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above aspect, it is preferable that the form of the semiconductor wafer is measured by an optical sensor or an electro-capacitance sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In the above aspect, the use of the optical sensor or the electro-capacitance sensor for the measurement leads to reducing measurement time and downsizing the measuring device. Feedback can thus be further quickly provided to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above aspect, it is preferable that an organic acid in the organic acid solution is at least one of a citric acid, a formic acid, an acetic acid, a butyric acid, an oxalic acid, a malonic acid and a succinic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In the above aspect, the surface of the polished semiconductor wafer can be kept hydrophobic by immersing the semiconductor wafer in the solution containing at least one of these various organic acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another aspect of the invention, a semiconductor wafer polishing apparatus includes: a polishing device configured to polish a semiconductor wafer; a storage bath configured to store the semiconductor wafer and contain an organic acid solution; a measuring device configured to measure a form of the semiconductor wafer; a transport device configured to transport the semiconductor wafer between the polishing device, the storage bath and the measuring device; and a polishing condition setting unit configured to set polishing conditions used by the polishing device based on a measurement result from the measuring device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The apparatus of the above aspect allows the polished semiconductor wafer to be transported between the polishing device, the storage bath and the measuring device by the transport device, significantly reducing a transport time of the semiconductor wafer among these devices as compared with a typical apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, the measurement result obtained by the measuring device, i.e., the measurement result of the form of the polished semiconductor wafer, is sent to the polishing condition setting unit. Based on the measurement result, the polishing condition setting unit analyzes the polishing conditions to give feedback to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step. The measurement result of the polished semiconductor wafer can thus be quickly fed back to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step, thereby manufacturing highly accurate and flat semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In the above aspect, it is preferable that an organic acid in the organic acid solution is at least one of a citric acid, a formic acid, an acetic acid, a butyric acid, an oxalic acid, a malonic acid and a succinic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above aspect, the surface of the polished semiconductor wafer can be kept hydrophobic by immersing the semiconductor wafer in the solution containing at least one of these various organic acids.</div>

The set polishing conditions are sent from the polishing condition setting unit <b>51</b> to the polishing controlling unit <b>52</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The measurement result of the form of the polished semiconductor wafer W is thus fed back to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step.</div>
<heading id="h-0017">Advantage(s) of First Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As described above, the first exemplary embodiment can provide the following advantages (1) to (7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">(1) The form of the polished semiconductor wafer W is measured before the polished surfaces thereof become hydrophilic, i.e., when the polished surfaces are hydrophobic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The form of the polished semiconductor wafer W can thus be highly accurately measured without any measurement error caused by waterdrops.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">(2) Prior to the measuring step, the polished semiconductor wafers W are immersed in the organic acid solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The immersion of the semiconductor wafers W in the organic acid solution allows the surfaces of the polished semiconductor wafers W to be kept hydrophobic, and thus reduces a dry time necessary for the surfaces of the semiconductor wafers W to be dried after immersed in the organic acid solution. Further, for instance, the polishing slurry remaining on the surfaces of the semiconductor wafers W having been rinsed with pure water after the polishing step can be neutralized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">(3) In the pulling-up step, the semiconductor wafer W is pulled up from the organic acid solution before the immersion time in the immersing step exceeds 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The polished surfaces of the semiconductor wafer W pulled up from the organic acid solution before the immersion time exceeds 60 minutes are kept hydrophobic. Thus, no waterdrop remains on the polished surfaces when the semiconductor wafer W is pulled up from the organic acid solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">(4) In the pulling-up step, the semiconductor wafer W is pulled up at a speed of 100 mm/sec or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The semiconductor wafer W can be pulled up at the above speed without any rise of the solution from the level of the solution. No waterdrop thus remains on the polished surfaces of the semiconductor wafer W having been pulled up. The first exemplary embodiment can thus eliminate the necessity of adding a drying step after the pulling-up step, reducing the number of processing steps and shortening time required before the start of the measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">(5) In the pulling-up step, the semiconductor wafer W is pulled up while kept in the posture with the polished surfaces thereof being substantially orthogonal to the level of the solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">As the semiconductor wafer W is pulled up while kept in the posture with the polished surfaces thereof being substantially orthogonal to the level of the solution, waterdrops are likely to gravitationally fall off. The waterdrops can thus be quickly removed from the polished surfaces. Consequently, the process quickly advances to the measuring step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">(6) In the measuring step, the form of the semiconductor wafer is measured using the optical sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The use of the optical sensor leads to reducing measurement time and downsizing the measuring device. Feedback can thus be further quickly provided to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">(7) In the polishing condition setting step, polishing conditions for the next polishing step are set based on the measurement result in the measuring step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The measurement result of the polished semiconductor wafer W can thus be quickly fed back to the polishing conditions for the next polishing step, thereby manufacturing highly accurate and flat semiconductor wafers W.</div>

<heading id="h-0025">MODIFICATION(S)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In the first and second exemplary embodiments, the single measuring device <b>3</b> is used for the single double-side polishing machine <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the single measuring device <b>3</b> may be disposed between two double-side polishing machines <b>10</b>. The single measuring device <b>3</b> can thus measure the forms of the semiconductor wafers W independently polished by the two double-side polishing machines <b>10</b>. Consequently, a set of semiconductor wafer polishing apparatus can be installed with halved installation costs for the measuring device <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In the second exemplary embodiment, the polishing device <b>1</b> is exemplified by the double-side polishing machine <b>10</b>, but may be a single-side polishing machine usable for intermediate-finish polishing. The double-side polishing machine <b>10</b> is capable of removing a large dimension of an allowance in a range from 5 μm to 30 μm, and thus is suitable for rough polishing. In contrast, the single-side polishing machine is capable of removing a small dimension of an allowance in a range from 0.2 μm to 1.0 μm, and thus is suitable for favorably finalizing surfaces of semiconductor wafers. The double-side polishing machine is suitable for the first exemplary embodiment. The single-side polishing machine is suitable for the second exemplary embodiment where the semiconductor wafer is profiled before and after polishing to provide feedback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In the first and second exemplary embodiments, the two sensors <b>31</b> are used to measure the front and back surfaces of the semiconductor wafer W. Alternatively, a single sensor <b>31</b> may be used to measure only one surface of the semiconductor wafer W. Such an arrangement where the single sensor <b>31</b> is provided is suitable for when the semiconductor wafer W to be measured has a small thickness such as 310 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In the first and second exemplary embodiments, the storage bath <b>2</b> contains the organic acid solution, but may contain a hydrofluoric acid solution instead of the organic acid solution.
