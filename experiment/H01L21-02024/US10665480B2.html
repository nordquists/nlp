<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a planarization processing method and to a planarization processing device, and particularly to a method and a device that can be suitably employed in planarization processing using a catalyst-aided chemical processing method.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2, catalyst-aided chemical processing methods are disclosed. Catalyst-aided chemical processing methods include using a catalyst composed of a transition metal that is disposed on a processing base surface, placing a workpiece in a solution that does not contain abrasive grains, etc., bringing the processing base surface into contact with or proximal to the processed surface of the workpiece, causing the processing base surface and the processed surface to move relative to each other, producing compounds in a chemical reaction between active species generated from the solution and surface atoms of the workpiece, and removing the compounds to process (etch) the workpiece; it is thereby possible to planarize (reduce the surface roughness of) a surface of difficult-to-process substrates made, for example, of SiC and GaN with high precision approximately at an atomic level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Incidentally, as a method of causing relative movement of the surface of the pad, which is formed of a transition metal layer that serves as the catalyst layer, and the surface of the processed substrate (processed surface), which serves as the workpiece, a large-diameter circular pad is rotated on a platen, and the surface of the processed substrate, which has a smaller diameter and is held by a rotating holder, is brought into contact or proximity with a circumferential portion of the surface of the pad that is undergoing rotating movement, as shown conventionally in Patent Literature 1.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In the processing methods of the related art described above, however, the apparatus is large because the diameter of the pad is at least twice the diameter of the workpiece, and an economical processing is not achieved because it takes a long period of time to process SiC and GaN substrates. Further, although the processed substrate is rotated while being pressed against the pad surface by the back pressure of an airbag provided in the holder, the processed substrate is pulled towards the pad surface by the so-called water-adhesion effect resulting from the solution that is supplied between the processed substrate and the pad having the catalyst layer of Pt or the like formed on the surface and that is a smooth flat surface; therefore, a large circumferential rotary force of the pad acts on the processed substrate, pulls the processed substrate away from the holder, and hurls it toward the outer circumference of the pad, resulting in a risk of damage by it being caught, etc., on an outwardly-located retainer. Thus, this decreased yields and has led to an increase in processing costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention solves such problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a planarization processing method and a planarization processing device capable of making the device more compact, reducing the risk of workpiece damage during processing and suppressing an increase in processing costs while achieving precise planarization processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the object described above, a planarization processing method according to the present invention is characterized by comprising: bringing a surface of a workpiece and a surface of a pad having a catalyst layer at least on the surface thereof into contact with or proximal to each other; rotating one of the workpiece and the pad in a plane of the surface thereof and around an axis that intersects the surface; simultaneously moving the other of the workpiece and the pad in a direction parallel to the surface thereof by at least an amount that makes possible planarization based on a catalytic reaction, and supplying a liquid necessary for the catalytic reaction between the surface of the workpiece and the surface of the pad that are in contact with or in proximity to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, the movement in the direction parallel to the surface may be movement that excludes rotation around the above-mentioned axis. The movement in the direction parallel to the surface can be a reciprocating movement. In this case, the travel distance of an outer circumference of the one of the workpiece and the pad, which is rotated, may be set so as to be 120% or less (excluding 0%) of the travel distance of the other of the workpiece and the pad, which moves in the direction parallel to the surface. It is noted that, instead of rotating one of the workpiece and the pad and moving the other in the direction parallel to the surface, one of the workpiece and the pad may be kept stationary and the other may be rotated and moved in the direction parallel to the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the planarization processing method according to the present invention, when planarization processing is performed using a catalyst-aided chemical processing method, one of the workpiece and the pad is rotated relative to the other and the other is moved relative to the one by at least an amount that makes possible planarization based on a catalytic reaction with the intention of averaging of the etching, whereby precise planarization processing is achieved. With respect to the movement at this time, a travel distance at the atomic-level suffices to make possible the processing. Therefore, it is not necessary to use a large-diameter pad, unlike in the related art; thus, because it is possible to set the outer diameter of the pad to be approximately equal to the outer diameter of the workpiece, the device can be miniaturized. In this case, if the movement described above is a reciprocating motion, the travel distance of the workpiece or the pad can be further reduced. Since it is not necessary to use a large-diameter pad, a large circumferential rotary force does not act on the workpiece, unlike in the related art, whereby the risk that the workpiece is hurled off toward the outer circumference of the pad and is damaged can be avoided. An increase in processing costs can therefore be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">A planarization processing device according to one aspect of the present teachings includes first holding means (<b>4</b>; <b>8</b>) that holds a rear surface of one of a workpiece (<b>7</b>) and a pad (<b>6</b>) having a catalyst layer at least on a surface thereof; first drive means (<b>101</b>) that rotates one of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the pad (<b>6</b>) in a plane of the surface of the one of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the pad (<b>6</b>) and around an axis that intersects the surface; second holding means (<b>4</b>; <b>8</b>) that holds the other of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the pad (<b>6</b>) and causes the surface thereof to face the surface of the one of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the pad (<b>6</b>); second drive means (<b>5</b>, <b>51</b>-<b>55</b>, <b>58</b>; <b>59</b>) that moves the second holding means (<b>4</b>; <b>8</b>) in a direction parallel to the surface of the other of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the pad (<b>6</b>) by at least an amount that makes possible planarization based on a catalytic reaction; and optionally third drive means (<b>102</b>) that advances the first holding means (<b>4</b>; <b>8</b>) or the second holding means (<b>4</b>; <b>8</b>) in a direction that intersects the surface of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) or the pad (<b>6</b>) to bring the surface of the workpiece (<b>7</b>) and the surface of the pad (<b>6</b>) into contact with or proximal to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Here, the movement in the direction parallel to the surface can be a reciprocating movement. In this case, the travel distance of the outer circumference of the one of the workpiece and the pad, which is rotated, may be set to be 120% or less (excluding 0%) of the travel distance of the other of the workpiece and the pad, which moves in the direction parallel to the surface. It is noted that, instead of rotating one of the workpiece and the pad and moving the other in the direction parallel to the surface, one of the workpiece and the pad may be kept stationary and the other may be rotated and moved in the direction parallel to the surface. Since the planarization processing device according to the present invention can carry out the planarization processing method according to the present invention, the same advantageous effects described above are provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The reference numerals in parentheses in the preceding paragraph provide, solely for reference purposes, the a representative, non-limiting correspondence of means plus function features with specific embodiments or structures that will be further described in the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, according to the present invention, while achieving precise planarization processing, the device can be miniaturized, the risk of damage of the workpiece during processing is lessened, and an increase in processing costs can be suppressed.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partial cross-sectional front view of a planarization processing device that carries out a method according to the prevent invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of the planarization processing device. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stands <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, which have symmetric letter-L-shaped cross sections, are disposed in parallel to each other on the right and left sides on a base <b>1</b> and extend in the forward/rearward direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (rightward/leftward direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>); rails <b>31</b>, which form linear guides <b>3</b>, are fixed onto the right and left stands <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> so as to extend therealong. Each of the rails <b>31</b> is provided with sliders <b>32</b>, which are slidable along the rail <b>31</b>, at two locations in the longitudinal direction thereof; a rectangular support plate <b>4</b> serving as a second holding means is placed on the right-left, front-rear sliders <b>32</b>. The support plate <b>4</b> is therefore linearly reciprocally movable along the rails <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A cam block <b>51</b>, which constitutes a reciprocating drive mechanism <b>5</b> that extends downward and will be described below, is fixed to a central portion of the lower surface of the support plate <b>4</b>. The cam block <b>51</b> is a thick protruding body extending in parallel to the rails <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; a cam opening <b>52</b>, which is elongated in the upward/downward direction, is formed in a longitudinally central portion of the cam block <b>51</b> in such a way that the cam opening <b>52</b> passes through the cam block <b>51</b> in the horizontal direction. A cam body <b>53</b>, which has a circular shape with a diameter approximately equal to the minor diameter of the opening <b>52</b>, is provided in the cam opening <b>52</b> so as to be movable along the cam opening <b>52</b> in the upward/downward direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">A crankshaft <b>54</b> is provided so as to pass through the above-described cam body <b>53</b> in the horizontal direction; the crankshaft <b>54</b> passes through the center of the cam body <b>53</b> in such a way that the crankshaft <b>54</b> can rotate relative to the cam body <b>53</b>. A central portion of the crankshaft <b>54</b> is eccentric from the line that connects the right and left opposite ends of the crankshaft <b>54</b>, one end of the crankshaft <b>54</b> being rotatably supported by a bearing member <b>55</b>, which is provided so as to stand on the base <b>1</b>; the other end of the crankshaft <b>54</b> is coupled to an output shaft <b>571</b> of a speed reducer <b>57</b>, which is fixed, in a horizontal attitude, to an upright wall of a letter-L-shaped support plate <b>56</b>. A drive motor <b>58</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is attached to the speed reducer <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In the structure described above, when the drive motor <b>58</b> is driven to rotate the crankshaft <b>54</b>, the cam body <b>53</b>, through which the central portion of the crankshaft <b>54</b> passes, undergoes rotating movement in a vertical plane while moving upward and downward in the cam opening <b>52</b>. As a result, in response to the rotation of the crankshaft <b>54</b>, the cam block <b>51</b> and the support plate <b>4</b>, which is integral therewith, are caused to undergo linear reciprocating movement in the direction along the rails <b>31</b>. The reciprocating drive mechanism <b>5</b>, which produces the linear reciprocating motion described above, is an example of a second drive means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">A circular container <b>61</b>, which stores liquid and opens upward, is provided so as to be placed on a central portion of the upper surface of the support plate <b>4</b>. A pad <b>6</b>, which has a catalyst layer with a predetermined thickness formed by a sputtering process or the like on the entire surface thereof, is provided on the bottom surface of the container <b>61</b>. Rubber or urethane or the like, which is resistant to the processing solution, is used as the material of the pad <b>6</b>. A transition metal, such as Pt, can be used as the catalyst. The diameter of the pad <b>6</b> may be set so as to be slightly greater than the outer diameter of a processed substrate <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">A spindle <b>9</b>, which has a circular cross-sectional shape, is provided above the container <b>61</b> so as to be vertically oriented and is held by a sleeve <b>91</b> so as to be rotatable with a vertical attitude. The spindle <b>9</b> is rotated by a drive motor <b>101</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) serving as a first drive means. The sleeve <b>91</b> is lifted and lowered by a drive cylinder <b>102</b> serving as a third drive means, and the spindle <b>9</b> is caused to move frontward and rearward relative to the pad <b>6</b> or to approach and move away from the pad <b>6</b> in response to the motion of the sleeve <b>91</b>. A holder <b>8</b> serving as a first holding means is provided at the lower end of the spindle <b>9</b> and holds the processed substrate <b>7</b>. The holder <b>8</b> is a known holder and will be described below in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the holder <b>8</b> in detail. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a base body <b>82</b> having a circular plate-shape is attached to the lower end surface of the spindle <b>9</b> via a ball <b>81</b>, which is located at the center of the base body <b>82</b> and is interposed between the base body <b>82</b> and the lower end surface in such a way that the angle of the base body <b>82</b> is changeable with respect to the lower end surface; a wall-shaped retainer <b>83</b> is provided so as to be vertically oriented and extend along the entire outer circumferential edge of the lower surface of the base body <b>82</b>. A cover body <b>84</b> is provided so as to protrude outward and upward and extend along the entire outer circumference of the retainer <b>83</b>. The processed substrate <b>7</b> is accommodated in the retainer <b>83</b>; a diaphragm <b>85</b> is located behind the processed substrate <b>7</b> and between the processed substrate <b>7</b> and the base body <b>82</b>. Compressed air is supplied into the diaphragm <b>85</b> through an air supply tube <b>86</b> so that, when the spindle <b>9</b> has been lowered, the processed substrate <b>7</b> is pressed against the surface of the pad <b>6</b> by a pressing force produced by the inflated diaphragm <b>85</b>. It is noted that a plurality of suction holes is formed in the diaphragm <b>85</b>; when the spindle <b>9</b> is lifted, the interior of the diaphragm <b>85</b> is evacuated, the processed substrate <b>7</b> is suctioned towards the suction holes and it is held in the holder <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">When a planarization processing of the lower surface (processed surface) of the processed substrate <b>7</b> is performed using a planarization processing device having such a structure, a liquid necessary for the catalytic reaction, such as HF, HCL, pure water or the like, is filled into the container <b>61</b>, the spindle <b>9</b>, i.e. the processed substrate <b>7</b>, is rotated, and at the same time the container <b>61</b> on the support plate <b>4</b> is caused to undergo a linear reciprocating motion in the horizontal direction along the rails <b>31</b>. That is, the processed surface of the processed substrate <b>7</b> and the pad <b>6</b>, which has the contacting catalyst layer formed thereon, are caused to rotate relative to each other and are simultaneously caused to undergo a relative reciprocating motion in a plane that intersects the axis of the rotation. The processed surface of the processed substrate <b>7</b> thus undergoes planarization processing in accordance with catalyst-aided chemical processing with high precision approximately at an atomic level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In this case, the relationship between the number of revolutions of the relative rotation and the relative reciprocating motion is preferably set so that the travel distance of the outer circumference of the processed substrate <b>7</b> is 120% or less (excluding 0%) of the reciprocating travel distance of the relative reciprocating motion. Here, although the range of movement of the reciprocating movement may intrinsically be within a minute range at the level of several atoms, it is determined based upon mechanical constraints and vibration frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the planarization processing method described above, even if the processed substrate <b>7</b> is suctioned towards the surface of the pad <b>6</b> due to the water-adhesion effect, a large circumferential rotary force does not act on the processed substrate <b>7</b>, unlike in the conventional art, because the surface of the pad <b>6</b> only undergoes a minute reciprocating motion. Thus, unlike in the conventional art, there is no problem of the processed substrate separating from the holder and being caught by the outer retainer, resulting in damage or the like.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Example Based on the Present Embodiment and Comparative Examples</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">An SiC substrate having an outer diameter of 6 inches was used as the processed substrate <b>7</b>, and ultrapure water was used as the liquid necessary for the catalytic reaction to perform the planarization processing. A Pt film serving as the catalyst layer was formed on the surface of a pad <b>6</b> having a diameter of 160 mm. In this state, the processed substrate <b>7</b> was rotated, and the support plate <b>4</b> (that is, the pad <b>6</b>) was caused to undergo reciprocating motion. The processed surface of the processed substrate <b>7</b> after the processing was observed with a noncontact three-dimensional surface profiler (Zygo NewView 6300 manufactured by ZYGO CORPORATION, USA). As a result thereof, Ra was 0.181 nm or smaller, and RMS was 0.228 nm or smaller, over the entire processed surface and in a field of view of 0.11 mm square.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In contrast, when only the relative rotation of the processed surface with respect to the pad was performed and relative reciprocating motion was stopped, conspicuous grooves extending in the circumferential direction of the processed surface were produced and uniform planarization was not performed. Further, when only the relative reciprocating motion of the processed surface with respect to the pad was performed and relative rotation was stopped, conspicuous grooves extending across the processed surface were produced and uniform planarization was not performed in this case as well. In the end, uniform planarization can be achieved when the travel distance of the outer circumferential portion of the processed substrate is set so as to be 120% or less of the reciprocating travel distance in the relative reciprocating motion.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another example of a planarization processing device. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the first embodiment, and the same reference symbols represent the same parts. In the present embodiment, in place of the reciprocating drive mechanism <b>5</b> in the first embodiment, a piston vibrator <b>59</b> is provided on the support plate <b>4</b> in the horizontal direction, and vibratory forces produced by the piston vibrator <b>59</b> cause the support plate <b>4</b> to undergo reciprocating movement (vibration) along the rails <b>31</b>. By using such a structure as well, the substrate surface of the processed substrate <b>7</b> undergoes planarization processing in accordance with catalyst-aided chemical processing with high precision approximately at an atomic level similar to the first embodiment; moreover, it is possible to simplify the reciprocating drive structure.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Example Based on the Present Embodiment and Comparative Examples</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">A GaN substrate having an outer diameter of 2 inches was used as the processed substrate <b>7</b>, and ultrapure water was used as the liquid necessary for the catalytic reaction to perform the planarization processing. A Pt film serving as the catalyst layer was formed on the surface of a pad <b>6</b> having a diameter of 53 mm. In this state, the processed substrate <b>7</b> was rotated, and the support plate <b>4</b> (that is, the pad <b>6</b>) was caused to undergo reciprocating motion. The processed surface of the processed substrate <b>7</b> after the processing was observed with the noncontact three-dimensional surface profiler (Zygo NewView 6300 manufactured by ZYGO CORPORATION, USA). As a result thereof, Ra was 0.3 nm or smaller, and RMS was 0.4 nm or smaller, over the entire processed surface and in a field of view of 0.54 mm square. The processed surface was then observed with a scanning probe microscope (Dimension Edge manufactured by BRUKER AXS CORPORATION, USA). As a result thereof, step terraces (0.26 nm) for each Ga single atom layer in a field of view of 2 μm square, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, could be confirmed. Further, during the planarization processing, the problem of separation of the processed substrate <b>7</b> from the holder <b>8</b> followed by damage of the processed substrate <b>7</b> did not occur.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Third Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support plate <b>4</b> is disposed above the base <b>1</b> with the four corners of the lower surface of the support plate <b>4</b> supported by coil springs <b>41</b>, and the liquid storing container <b>61</b> is provided on the support plate <b>4</b>. A cushion layer <b>63</b> having a pad <b>64</b> thereon is placed in the container <b>61</b> on the bottom side via an adhesive tape layer <b>62</b>, and the processed substrate <b>7</b> is placed on the upper surface of the pad <b>64</b>. The center of the lower surface of the support plate <b>4</b> is placed on the vertex of a support member <b>11</b>, which has an upwardly convex shape, so that the support plate <b>4</b> is shakeable in the three-dimensional space. The support member <b>11</b> is held on the base <b>1</b> by a holding member <b>12</b>. A vibrator <b>67</b> is attached to the side surface of the container <b>61</b>. The spindle <b>9</b> enters the container <b>61</b> from above, and a pad <b>66</b> is bonded to the lower surface of the spindle <b>9</b> via a cushion layer <b>65</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The spindle <b>9</b> is lowered so that the pads <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> sandwich the upper and lower surfaces of the processed substrate <b>7</b>. In this state, when the spindle <b>9</b> is rotated and the vibrator <b>67</b> is activated, the rotary force of the spindle <b>9</b> and a shaking motion, which includes a horizontal reciprocating movement (vibration) produced by the vibrator <b>67</b>, are transmitted to the processed substrate <b>7</b> and to the upper and lower pads <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, which sandwich the processed substrate <b>7</b>; thus, either of the upper and lower surfaces of the processed substrate <b>7</b> can be planarized with the same precision and uniformity, etc. as in each of the embodiments described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the first embodiment described above, although the processed substrate is rotated and the pad is caused to undergo a linear reciprocating motion, the processed substrate may be caused to undergo a linear reciprocating motion and the pad may be rotated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The reciprocating drive mechanism is not limited to the mechanism in the first embodiment described above, and an ordinary crank mechanism that converts rotary motion produced by a drive motor into linear reciprocating motion can be used. Further, a ball screw mechanism, an attraction/repulsion mechanism based on magnetic force, a cylinder mechanism, and other mechanisms can be used. In addition, the reciprocating motion need not necessarily be linear motion. For example, it also may be motion that traces an arc in a two-dimensional plane, such as circular motion. Further, the reciprocating motion need not necessarily be employed, and unidirectional motion may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In each of the embodiments described above, the base may also be caused to undergo reciprocating movement in the direction parallel to the surface of the base, for example, by using a ball screw mechanism. In this case, planarization of the processed substrate is uniformly performed both on a central portion and on a peripheral portion.</div>
