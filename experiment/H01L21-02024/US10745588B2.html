<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The surface of a silicon wafer used as a component of a semiconductor device, etc., is generally polished to a high quality mirror finish via a lapping step (rough polishing step) and a polishing step (precision polishing step). The polishing step typically comprises a preliminary polishing step and a final polishing step. As the polishing method in the polishing step, chemical mechanical polishing is known, where a water-soluble polymer typified by cellulose derivatives, etc., is included in the polishing liquid. In this method, the water-soluble polymer is adsorbed on and released from the abrasive and silicon wafer, thereby contributing to reduce defects and haze in polished surface. As a technical literature related to silicon wafer polishing compositions, for instance, Patent Document 1 is cited. Patent Document 2 is a technical literature about a polish used for polishing silicon oxide.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the cellulose derivative is a polymer derived from a natural compound (cellulose), there are limitations in managing the chemical structure and purity as compared with a polymer obtainable by artificial polymerization of monomers (or a synthetic polymer, hereinafter). For instance, commercially readily available cellulose derivatives are limited in weight average molecular weight and range of molecular weight distribution (ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn)). In addition, since they are derived from natural compounds, it is difficult to significantly reduce impurities and local disorder (microscale aggregation, etc.) in their polymer structures, etc., that may cause surface defect. The amounts and extent of such impurities, etc., are likely to vary widely as well. With a tendency of design rules for semiconductor devices to become finer, growing demands are expected for their surface quality (typically fewer defects, low haze, etc.) after polished. In this view, it will be useful to provide a polishing composition excellent in reducing defects and haze, with the composition not essentially requiring a cellulose derivative.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have searched for polymers highly capable of controlling the adsorption and release of a water-soluble polymer on and from abrasives and silicon wafers as described above and have resulted in findings that a composition that comprises a polymer having a certain structure exhibits excellent effect to reduce defects and haze in a polished surface. In other words, an objective of the present invention is to provide a silicon wafer polishing composition capable of producing excellent effect to reduce defects and haze in a polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the objective, this description provides a silicon wafer polishing composition used in the presence of an abrasive. The composition comprises a silicon wafer polishing accelerator, an amide group-containing polymer, and water. The amide group-containing polymer has a building unit A in its main chain. The building unit A comprises a main chain carbon atom constituting the main chain of the amide group-containing polymer and a secondary amide group or a tertiary amide group. The carbonyl carbon atom constituting the secondary amide group or tertiary amide group is directly coupled to the main chain carbon atom. An amide group-containing polymer having this structure effectively contributes to reduce defects and haze in a silicon wafer surface, that is, a polishing object. Thus, polishing with the silicon wafer polishing composition (or simply the “polishing composition” hereinafter) can effectively reduce defects and haze in a polished surface.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The polishing composition disclosed herein is characterized by comprising an amide group-containing polymer that has a building unit A in its main chain. The amide group-containing polymer is typically a water-soluble polymer. The building unit A comprises a main chain carbon atom constituting the main chain of the amide group-containing polymer and a secondary amide group or a tertiary amide group. The amide group-containing polymer disclosed herein may comprise one species of building unit A, or two or more species of building unit A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The main chain carbon atom in the building unit A comprises an α-carbon atom specified in relation to the carbonyl carbon atom constituting the secondary amide group or tertiary amide group. The building unit A may also comprise a β-carbon atom. These α- and β-carbon atoms may correspond to two carbon atoms that constitute an ethylenic unsaturated bond in a polymerizable monomer described later. A hydrogen atom bonded to the main chain carbon atom (typically an α-carbon atom) may be substituted with a substituent such as a methyl group, phenyl group, benzyl group, chloro group, difluoromethyl group, trifluoromethyl group, cyano group, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The carbonyl carbon atom constituting the secondary amide group or tertiary amide group is directly coupled to the main chain carbon atom (α-carbon atom). By polishing using an amide group-containing polymer that has a building unit as described above in its main chain, defects and haze are effectively reduced in silicon wafer surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The secondary amide group is represented by a formula —CONHR<sup>a </sup>and the tertiary amide group is represented by a formula —CONR<sup>a</sup>R<sup>b</sup>. In the formulas, R<sup>a </sup>in the secondary amide group as well as R<sup>a </sup>and R<sup>b </sup>in the tertiary amide group is an organic group. For instance, it can be an organic group with 1 to 18 carbon (C) atoms. In addition to C and H, the organic group may comprise N, as a nitrogen constituting a form such as an amide, amine, nitrile or the like; an oxygen atom (O), as an oxygen constituting a form such as an ester, ether, ketone, hydroxyl group, or the like; and further a sulfur atom (S), as a sulfur constituting a form such as a thioether or the like. R<sup>a </sup>and R<sup>b </sup>in the tertiary amide group may be connected to N directly or via O or S. Preferable examples of R<sup>a </sup>in the secondary amide group as well as of R<sup>a </sup>and R<sup>b </sup>in the tertiary amide group include R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>in the general formula (1) described later and (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>a</sub>—NR<sup>6</sup>R<sup>7 </sup>in the general formula (3) also described later.

Examples of the polymerizable group having an ethylenic unsaturated bond include acryloyl group and an α-substituted derivative (e.g. methacryloyl group, α-phenylacryloyl group, etc.) substituted with the substituent. In particular, a polymerizable monomer (a) that comprises a (meth)acryloyl group as the polymerizable group is preferable.</div>

However, in view of practical convenience, the adsorption ratio may be measured using an abrasive different from the one used in the polishing composition as far as no large difference occurs in adsorption ratio when compared with the adsorption ratio value measured using the abrasive used in the polishing composition (e.g. as far as the adsorption ratio of the measured polymer is clearly higher or lower than 10% regardless of which abrasive is used).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The polishing composition disclosed herein is used in the presence of an abrasive. The abrasive serves to mechanically polish a silicon wafer surface. In the polishing composition disclosed herein, the abrasive also serves to rub the amide group-containing polymer adsorbed on the abrasive surface against a silicon wafer or serves to take up the amide group-containing polymer adsorbed on the silicon wafer. By this, chemical polishing by means of the silicon wafer polishing accelerator is adjusted. In this description, the “polishing composition being used in the presence of an abrasive” may encompass an embodiment where the abrasive is contained in the polishing composition. Such an embodiment is considered as a preferable embodiment of the polishing composition disclosed herein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As the abrasive, inorganic grains are preferable. In particular, grains of an oxide of a metal or metalloid are preferable. Preferable examples of the abrasive that can be used in the art disclosed herein include silica grains. A reason for this is that when silica grains formed of oxygen atoms and the same element as the polished article (silicon wafer) are used, metal or metalloid residues different from silicon will not be generated after the polishing, eliminating risks such as contamination of the silicon wafer surface and degradation of electrical properties of the silicon wafer caused by dispersion of metal or metalloid residues that are not silicon in the polished article. An example of an embodiment of the polishing composition preferable from such a standpoint is a polishing composition consisting of silica grains as the abrasive. By nature, silica can be readily obtained in a highly pure state. This is also one of the reasons that silica grains are preferable as the abrasive. Specific examples of silica grains include colloidal silica, fumed silica, precipitated silica and the like. From the standpoint of the less likelihood of scratching the article surface and capability of making a surface with lower haze, colloidal silica and fumed silica are cited as preferable silica grains. Colloidal silica is particularly preferable. In particular, colloidal silica is preferably used as the abrasive in the polishing composition used for polishing (especially, final polishing) of a silicon wafer.</div>

From the standpoint of the likelihood of yielding a highly smooth surface, the abrasive has an average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>of preferably 100 nm or smaller, more preferably 50 nm or smaller, or yet more preferably 40 nm or smaller.

For example, it can be formulated in a manner that for use in polishing a polishing object, a pack A comprising some of the components of the polishing composition (e.g. a dispersion comprising an abrasive (e.g. silica grains), a silicon wafer polishing accelerator and water) is mixed with a pack B comprising the rest of the components (e.g. a solution of an amide group-containing polymer). Alternatively, it can be used in an embodiment where, with a polishing composition comprising a silicon wafer polishing accelerator, an amide group-containing polymer and water, an abrasive separately obtained is mixed at a certain point of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">&lt;Preparation of Polishing Composition&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The method for producing the polishing composition disclosed herein is not particularly limited. For instance, the respective components of the polishing composition can be mixed, using a commonly known mixing device such as a propeller stirrer, ultrasonic disperser, homo mixer, etc. The way of mixing these components is not particularly limited. For instance, all the components can be mixed at once or in a suitably selected order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0023" num="0000">&lt;Polishing&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The polishing composition disclosed herein can be used for polishing an article, for instance, in an embodiment comprising the following operations. Described below is a preferable embodiment of the method for polishing an article using the polishing composition disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In particular, a polishing liquid (which is typically a slurry polishing liquid and sometimes called a polishing slurry) is obtained, comprising a polishing composition disclosed herein. The obtaining of the polishing liquid may include preparing the polishing liquid by subjecting the polishing composition to operations such as concentration adjustment (e.g. dilution), pH adjustment, etc. Alternatively, the polishing composition can be used straight as the polishing liquid. As for a multi-pack polishing composition, the obtaining of the polishing liquid may include mixing the packs, diluting a certain phase or multiple phases prior to the mixing, diluting the mixture after the mixing, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Subsequently, the polishing slurry is supplied to an article and polishing is carried out by a conventional method. For instance, when carrying out final polishing of a silicon wafer, the silicon wafer after a lapping step and preliminary polishing step is set in a general polishing machine and via a polishing pad in the polishing machine, the polishing slurry is supplied to the surface (surface to be polished) of the silicon wafer. Typically, while the polishing slurry is continuously supplied, the polishing pad is pushed against the surface of the silicon wafer, and the two are moved (e.g. moved in circular motion) in coordination. Via such a polishing step, polishing of the article is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The polishing pad(s) used in the polishing step are not particularly limited. For instance, any of the non-woven fabric type, suede type, abrasive-bearing type, abrasive-free type, etc., can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0024" num="0000">&lt;Rinse&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">A polished object polished with the polishing composition disclosed herein that comprises an abrasive may be rinsed with a rinse solution that comprises the same components as the polishing composition, but free of an abrasive. In other words, the art disclosed herein may have a rinsing step, that is, a step of rinsing the polished object with a rinse solution that comprises the same components as the polishing composition but free of an abrasive. The rinsing step can reduce the residue, such as abrasive grains, etc., that may cause defects and haze in the surface of the polished object. The rinsing step can be performed between two polishing steps, or after the final polishing step, but before the cleaning step described later. By rinsing with a rinse solution that is free of an abrasive, but otherwise comprises the same components as the polishing composition, defects and haze can be further reduced without hindering the effect of the amide group-containing polymer adsorbed on the silicon wafer surface. Such a rinse solution can be typically a silicon wafer polishing composition that comprises a silicon wafer polishing accelerator, an amide group-containing polymer and water (in particular, a composition used for rinsing in silicon wafer polishing, or a rinse composition). This silicon wafer rinse composition is abrasive-free, but otherwise, its composition and other features are basically the same as the silicon wafer polishing composition. Thus, the description is not repeated here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0025" num="0000">&lt;Cleaning&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The article polished with the polishing composition disclosed herein is typically cleaned after polished (after rinsed if necessary). The cleaning can be carried out, using a suitable cleaning solution. The cleaning solution used is not particularly limited. Usable examples include SC-1 solution (a mixture of ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O); cleaning with SC-1 cleaning solution is referred to as “SC-1 cleaning” hereinafter), SC-2 cleaning solution (a mixture of HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O) and the like generally used in the field of semiconductors. The temperature of the cleaning solution can be, for instance, room temperature to about 90° C. From the standpoint of increasing the cleaning efficiency, a cleaning solution at about 50° C. to 85° C. can be preferably used.</div>
