<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel production method of an aluminum nitride single crystal substrate, and in more detail relates to a novel production method of an aluminum nitride single crystal substrate including iteratively using a base substrate as a base substrate for growing an aluminum nitride single crystal layer thereon.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Aluminum nitride single crystal substrates are useful as substrates for electronic devices such as deep ultraviolet light emitting devices and high voltage Schottky diodes. Currently, aluminum nitride single crystal substrates are usually produced by a process including, in the sequence set forth: supplying raw materials including an aluminum source and a nitrogen source onto a base substrate, to grow an aluminum nitride single crystal layer over the base substrate; separating the base substrate and the aluminum nitride single crystal layer, and processing this obtained aluminum nitride single crystal layer by e.g., polishing, to produce an aluminum nitride single crystal substrate having desired surface properties. Examples of methods to grow an aluminum nitride single crystal layer over a base substrate include: a sublimation method which sublimes aluminum nitride as the aluminum source and the nitrogen source (for example, see Patent Literatures 1 and 2); and hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) which uses an aluminum trihalide gas as the aluminum source and ammonia gas as the nitrogen source gas (for example, see Patent Literature 3).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Production methods of gallium nitride single crystals have been well established, and thick gallium nitride single crystal layers can be produced. In contrast, aluminum nitride single crystals are easier to break than gallium nitride single crystals, and raw material gases of the former are more reactive than those of the latter. Therefore, it has been difficult to grow thick aluminum nitride single crystal layers. For example, growth of aluminum nitride over a sapphire substrate or a SiC substrate has been liable to suffer crack formation in aluminum nitride during growth or during cooling after growth, due to differences of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between a base substrate and aluminum nitride. And also, it has been difficult to grow a thick aluminum nitride single crystal layer of good crystallinity by direct application of a void assisted separation method (i.e., masking a sapphire base substrate with titanium and then growing a thick gallium nitride single crystal layer) to aluminum nitride.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">A sublimation method is known as a method to produce a thick aluminum nitride single crystal layer (for example, see Patent Literatures 1 and 2). In this method, an aluminum nitride single crystal layer which has grown over a base substrate also grows in lateral directions, and thus gradually forms an aluminum nitride single crystal of a larger diameter. An aluminum nitride single crystal substrate of a larger diameter is usually more advantageous for uses such as semiconductor device substrates, in view of improving yield.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">A larger aluminum nitride single crystal substrate may be produced by: separating the aluminum nitride single crystal layer grown over the base substrate; and iteratively growing an aluminum nitride single crystal layer over the separated aluminum nitride single crystal layer as a base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, it has been found that using a substrate obtained from an aluminum nitride single crystal layer grown over a base substrate as a new base substrate has the following drawback. That is, aluminum nitride single crystal layers grown by iteratively separating a thick aluminum nitride single crystal layer grown over a base substrate as a new base substrate are prone to have a greater variance in quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a method which can iteratively produce aluminum nitride single crystal layers with more stable crystal qualities.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventors investigated the cause of the variance, so as to solve the problem. They conducted the following experiments. First, they cut a thick aluminum nitride single crystal layer grown over a base substrate by means of a single wire saw and took a plurality of aluminum nitride single crystal substrates, and prepared a plurality of base substrates under the same polishing conditions of growth surfaces (main faces). Then, they further grew an aluminum nitride single crystal layer over each base substrate, and measured properties of each aluminum nitride single crystal layer, and found that these aluminum nitride single crystal layers had variance in quality. From this result, it was presumed that the variance did not develop during growth of each aluminum nitride single crystal layer, but that the cause of the variance lied in each base substrate prepared from the thick aluminum nitride single crystal layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the cause of the variance was presumed as follows: that is, a greater thickness of an aluminum nitride single crystal layer requires a longer growth time, which leads to an increased probability for the aluminum nitride single crystal layer to contain impurities, foreign substances, voids, crystal defects, etc., due to irregular changes such as deterioration of members in a crystal growth apparatus or formation of deposits. Use of the part containing the impurities, foreign substances, voids, crystal defects, etc., as a new base substrate leads to production of an aluminum nitride single crystal layer having deteriorated crystal qualities, or production of an aluminum nitride single crystal layers having different crystal qualities every time a base substrate is changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">From the results above, the inventors considered that iteratively using a base substrate as many times as possible would reduce variance of qualities and properties of produced aluminum nitride single crystals, and found conditions which makes it possible to repeatedly use a base substrate, and thus completed an invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">(Preparation Step)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present invention, the preparation step is a step of preparing the base substrate <b>10</b>. This base substrate <b>10</b> consists of an aluminum nitride single crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">(Base Substrate)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">A surface of the base substrate over which the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> is grown, that is, the main face, is not specifically limited. Since the aluminum nitride single crystal self-supporting substrate <b>11</b> <i>a </i>with a stable quality can be produced in the present invention, a crystal face of the main face is not limited as long as an aluminum nitride single crystal can be grown. Therefore, for example, the main face may be a low-index face such as a (112) face. In view of usefulness of the obtained aluminum nitride single crystal self-supporting substrate <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and easy growth of the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b>, the main face is preferably a (001) face, a (110) face, or a (100) face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be described below, a main face of the base substrate used in the repetition step has a crystal face index corresponding to the main face of the base substrate prepared in this preparation step.

Having such an offset angle can make the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> thicker. While the main face of the base substrate prepared in the preparation step corresponds to the main face of the base substrate (renewed base substrate <b>10</b> <i>b </i>or <b>10</b> <i>c</i>) used in the repetition step as described above, this offset angle (offset angle of the renewed base substrate <b>10</b> <i>b </i>or <b>10</b> <i>c</i>) can be adjusted in the renewing polishing step.</div>

Here, when the main face is a (001) face, the specific crystal face is a (103) face; when the main face is a (110) face, the specific crystal face is a (114) face; and when the main face is a (100) face, the specific crystal face is a (106) face. The incident angle between the incident X-ray and the main face is more preferably no more than 2Â°. In view of current measurement techniques, the lower limit of the incident angle between the incident X-ray and the main face is 0.1Â°. When the X-ray omega rocking curve of the specific crystal face of the base substrate is measured, the base substrate <b>10</b> is irradiated with an X-ray at a narrow incident angle. Thus, a value of a half width of the X-ray omega rocking curve reflects crystal qualities in the neighborhood of the crystal surface. Therefore, measuring a half width of the X-ray omega rocking curve of the specific crystal face makes it possible to determine, in particular, whether or not a damaged layer formed by polishing are reduced. In the base substrate <b>10</b>, the X-ray omega rocking curve of the specific crystal face of which has a half width of the upper limit or below, a damaged layer in the growth surface (main face) of the base substrate is reduced. Therefore, using the base substrate <b>10</b>, the X-ray omega rocking curve of the specific crystal face of which has a half width of the upper limit or below, improves the quality of the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> grown over the base substrate <b>10</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In measurement of the X-ray omega rocking curve of the specific crystal face, since the means for monochromation of an X-ray source affects resolution of the measured half-width, an X-ray source monochromated by being diffracted twice by the (220) face of a germanium single crystal is preferably used.</div>

In a case of a liquid-phase method, the aluminum source and the nitrogen source are solution in which aluminum nitride is dissolved.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">(Preferred Growth Method; Growth of Aluminum Nitride Single Crystal Layer <b>11</b> by HVPE)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Among these growth methods, the effect of the producing method of the aluminum nitride single crystal of the present invention is significant when the aluminum nitride single crystal is grown by HVPE (hydride vapor phase epitaxy) among the other methods of vapor phase growth. HVPE is preferable for production of an aluminum nitride single crystal substrate for light emitting devices because the concentration of impurities that have a bad effect on a deep ultraviolet light transmissivity can be lowered although the growth rate is lower than a sublimation method. HVPE is also preferable for production of an aluminum nitride single crystal substrate for electronic devices because impurities can be reduced, which reduces the density of point defects such as aluminum vacancy which have a bad effect on electron mobility. HVPE makes crystal qualities and mass productivity well-balanced because the growth rate is higher than a liquid-phase method, which makes it possible to grow a single crystal of good crystallinity at a high deposition rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">HVPE has advantages described above. When the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> is grown, though, high reactivity of an aluminum halide gas and ammonia easily causes a reaction in a gas phase in addition to the reaction on the base substrate <b>10</b>, which leads to easy formation of particulate aluminum nitride. As a result, unintended fine particles may adhere to the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> grown over the base substrate <b>10</b>. If the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> to which such fine particles adhere is separated, cut, and polished to make base substrates, an aluminum nitride single crystal grown over each base substrate is prone to have variance. The present invention makes it possible to reduce this variance, and thus can be preferably used when the aluminum nitride single crystal layer <b>11</b> is grown by HVPE.</div>

The aluminum nitride single crystal layer is grown by supplying an aluminum source gas and a nitrogen source gas into a reactor, and making these gasses react on the heated base substrate <b>10</b>. Examples of the aluminum source gas used here include aluminum halide gases such as aluminum chloride gas, and mixed gases of organoaluminum gas and hydrogen halide gases. Preferred examples of the nitrogen source gas include ammonia gas. These raw material gasses are supplied together with a carrier gas such as hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, argon gas, and helium gas. One gas may be individually used, or two or more gases may be used in combination, as a carrier gas. Further, the aluminum source gas and the nitrogen source gas may be supplied with an additional halogen-based gas such as a halogen gas and a hydrogen halide gas, so as to suppress formation of metal aluminum from a disproportionation reaction of the aluminum halide gas. In addition to the supply of these gases, growth conditions such as a shape of a nozzle that supplies the raw material gases onto the base substrate, a shape of the reactor into which the raw material gasses are supplied, the composition of the carrier gas, the supply of the carrier gas, the linear velocity of the gas flow in the reactor, a growth pressure (pressure in the reactor), and the heating temperature (growth temperature) of the base substrate are properly adjusted, so as to obtain good crystal qualities at a desired growth rate. Typical examples of the growth conditions include: aluminum source gas: 0.1 to 100 sccm; nitrogen source gas: 1 to 10000 sccm; additionally supplied halogen-based gas: 0.1 to 10000 sccm; total flow of carrier gas: 1000 to 100000 sccm; composition of carrier gas: nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, and helium (gas composition may be freely selected); linear velocity at nozzle outlet that supplies aluminum source gas: 50 to 500 sccm; linear velocity at nozzle outlet that supplies nitrogen source gas: 10 to 400 sccm; linear velocity of gas to make the entire atmosphere inside a reactor keep flowing: 5 to 200 sccm; growth pressure: 36 to 1000 Torr; and heating temperature (growth temperature) of base substrate: 1200 to 1800Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Various researches have been made on HVPE so as to obtain a single crystal of good crystallinity.

Among them, in the present invention, it is preferable to employ as a raw material gas an aluminum halide gas (comprising an aluminum trihalide gas as a major component) with a reduced content of an aluminum monohalide gas. An aluminum trihalide gas with a high content of an aluminum monohalide gas may lead to low crystal qualities. Therefore, it is preferable to take a measure to make an aluminum monohalide gas contained in the aluminum source gas as little as possible.</div>

Specifically, a growth stage of a short period for taking a measure such as limiting the supply of the raw materials, temporarily increasing the supply of the coexisting halogen-based gas, and fluctuating a pressure may be provided at the initial stage of growth on the base substrate, and after the growth environment stabilizes, the conditions may be changed for those for growing a thick layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The renewing polishing step is preferably completed by chemomechanical polishing (CMP) in order to remove the distortion layer in cutting. A known method can be employed for CMP. Examples of an abrasive that can be used here include abrasives containing materials such as silica, alumina, ceria, silicon carbide, boron nitride, and diamond. The properties of the abrasive may be alkaline, neutral, or acidic. Since alkali resistance of a nitrogen-polar face (âc face) of aluminum nitride is low, a weakly alkaline, neutral or acidic abrasive, specifically an abrasive of no more than 9 in pH is more preferably used than a strong alkaline abrasive. Of course, if a protection film is formed on the nitrogen-polar face, a strong alkaline abrasive can be used as well without any problem. An additive such as an oxidizing agent may be incorporated into the abrasive in order to improve the polishing rate. A commercially available polishing pad can be used, and material and hardness thereof are not specifically restricted.</div>
