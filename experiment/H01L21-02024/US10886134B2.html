<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for polishing a semiconductor silicon wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A semiconductor silicon wafer (hereinafter also referred to as simply a silicon wafer or a wafer) is usually polished in multiple stages, changing types of polishing pad or polishing agent. In such a case, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the polishing that is performed first may be called primary polishing, the polishing that is performed after the primary polishing may be called secondary polishing, and the last polishing that is performed after the secondary polishing may be called final polishing. Hereinafter, the terms of primary polishing, secondary polishing, and final polishing will be used in the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The primary polishing process is generally performed on a double side polishing machine which has hard polishing pads made of non-woven fabric or urethane foam attached to the upper and lower turn tables. The wafer is held inside a hole of a carrier, the carrier is in an interposed state between upper and lower turn tables, the polishing agent is dropped between the upper and lower turn tables while rotating in opposite directions to one another, and the carrier also rotates and revolves, whereby both the front and back surfaces of the wafer are polished simultaneously. The carrier gains rotary driving force from a sun gear and an internal gear that are on the internal circumference and the external circumference of the upper and lower turn tables. As the polishing agent, an alkaline based polishing agent that includes free abrasive grains such as colloidal silica is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the secondary polishing process, polishing is performed on a single side polishing apparatus by pressing a polishing head in which the wafer is held against a turn table which has a polishing pad attached, dropping an alkaline based polishing agent which includes free abrasive grains such as colloidal silica, and rotating and sliding against one another. A polishing pad made of hard non-woven fabric or urethane foam is generally used in the secondary polishing as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Immediately before the end of the polishing in the primary polishing or the secondary polishing, in order to suppress etching and adhesion of foreign substances of the wafer surface due to the primary polishing agent or the secondary polishing agent, polishing is performed using a polishing agent which includes water-soluble polymer cellulose such as hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) for the purpose of hydrophilizing the wafer surface. This polishing may be called rinse polishing. In addition, the polishing agent that is used at this time is called rinse polishing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The final polishing process is performed on a single side polishing apparatus as with the secondary polishing. Here, one purpose of the final polishing is to improve surface roughness of the wafer, especially fine roughness called haze which has a spatial wavelength of a few microns or less while reducing surface defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Polishing agents which include water-soluble polymer such as hydroxyethyl cellulose are known to have the effect of improving wafer surface roughness which has a short spatial wavelength such as haze (Patent Document 1). This is because water-soluble polymer, adsorbed on the wafer surface, has the function of suppressing polishing of that portion of the wafer, and the polymer that adheres to a convex portion of a concave and convex portion which is a wafer roughness component is easily delaminated due to contact with the polishing pad so that this portion is polished. On the other hand, the concave portion does not get polished because the water-soluble polymer is retained. It can be conjectured that, as a result, the convex portion is selectively polished, whereby the wafer surface roughness is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">For this reason, in the final polishing, the polishing is performed using a polishing agent which includes water-soluble polymer such as hydroxyethyl cellulose and a soft polishing pad such as a suede type one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Here, hydroxyethyl cellulose which has a large average molecular weight (for example 1,000,000 or more) becomes a medium itself in the solution and tends to cause agglomeration of the free abrasive grains in the polishing agent, and there is a problem that polishing with such a polishing agent makes minute surface defects (micro scratches) liable to be generated on the wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, as a means to salve this problem, a method using a polishing agent which includes hydroxyethyl cellulose with a small average molecular weight or a method of reducing agglomeration by filtering additionally is sometimes adopted (Patent Document 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, hydroxyethyl cellulose with a small average molecular weight (for example 400,000 or less) has a weak adsorption to the wafer surface, that is, it has a low protective performance of the wafer surface. Especially when mechanical action in a polishing is strong, for example, when a hard polishing pad is used and when the wafer load is high or when the turn table or the polishing head have a high rotating speed at the time of polishing, the water-soluble polymer adhered to the wafer surface is delaminated and protection of the wafer surface is not enough, and etching of the wafer surface leads to the increase of quality failure such as haze unevenness, slurry burn, or defects with gradual convex or concave shapes called Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) defects.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0014">The object of the present invention is to provide a method for polishing a semiconductor silicon wafer with few minute defects on the wafer surface, few DIC defects, and good surface roughness.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0015">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a polishing method for polishing a semiconductor silicon wafer by sliding the semiconductor silicon wafer, held by a polishing head, against a polishing pad attached to a turn table while supplying a polishing agent, wherein when the semiconductor silicon wafer is subjected to primary polishing, secondary polishing, and final polishing in turn, the secondary polishing comprises polishing by an alkaline based polishing agent which includes free abrasive grains and does not include a water-soluble polymer agent, and subsequent rinse polishing by a polishing agent which includes a water-soluble polymer agent and the rinse polishing comprises two stages of polishing, wherein, after performing a first stage of the rinse polishing while supplying a polishing agent which includes a water-soluble polymer agent, a second stage of the rinse polishing is performed while supplying a switched polishing agent whose water-soluble polymer agent has an average molecular weight larger than the polishing agent of the first stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0016">With such a polishing method, the silicon wafer after the secondary polishing can have few minute defects or DIC defects on the wafer surface, and the surface roughness can be improved. In addition, as a result, a good silicon wafer regarding the above minute defect, DIC defect, and surface roughness can also be obtained after the final polishing without changing the polishing conditions of the final polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0017">At this time, the free abrasive grains may be colloidal silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0018">Colloidal silica is often used as the free abrasive grains in the secondary polishing and can be easily prepared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0019">In addition, the water-soluble polymer agent may be hydroxyethyl cellulose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0020">Hydroxyethyl cellulose is often used as the water-soluble polymer agent in the rinse polishing agent and can be easily prepared. In addition, the wafer can be protected and have its surface roughness improved efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0021">In addition, the polishing agent of the first stage of the rinse polishing may include a water-soluble polymer agent with an average molecular weight of 200,000 or more and less than 700,000, and the polishing agent of the second stage of the rinse polishing may include a water-soluble polymer agent with an average molecular weight of 700,000 or more and 1500,000 or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0022">By so setting the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer agent in the polishing agent of the first stage of the rinse polishing to the above range, degradation of the number of minute defects can be suppressed more efficiently, and in addition, surface roughness can be improved more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0023">In addition, by setting the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer agent in the polishing agent of the second stage of the rinse polishing to the above range, the wafer surface can be protected well enough, and the degradation of the number of DIC defects can be more effectively suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0024">In addition, values of a polishing load, turn table rotating speed, and polishing head rotating speed in the first stage of rinse polishing may be within ±30% of values in the polishing by the alkaline based polishing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0025">In this manner, reduction in the productivity of polished wafers can be prevented effectively, and surface roughness after the secondary polishing and after the final polishing can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0026">In addition, values of a polishing load, turn table rotating speed, and polishing head rotating speed in the second stage of rinse polishing may be 70% or less of values in the polishing by the alkaline based polishing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0027">In this manner, the wafer surface can be more efficiently protected with the water-soluble polymer agent, and degradation of surface defects such as minute defects and DIC defects can be prevented even more.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0028">As described above, the inventive polishing method can make the silicon wafer after the secondary polishing and after the final polishing have a reduced number of minute defects and DIC defects, and good surface roughness.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0034">Hereinafter, the inventive polishing method will be described in detail as an example of an embodiment with reference to the drawings, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a polishing apparatus that may be used in the secondary polishing of the inventive polishing method. The polishing apparatus <b>1</b> is a single side polishing apparatus, and is composed of a turn table <b>2</b> which has a polishing pad <b>5</b> attached, a polishing head <b>3</b>, and a polishing agent supply mechanism <b>4</b>. The turn table <b>2</b> can be rotated by the rotation of a rotary shaft <b>6</b>, and in addition, the polishing head <b>3</b> can also be rotated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0036">A semiconductor silicon wafer W is polished by supplying a polishing agent <b>7</b> from the polishing agent supply mechanism <b>4</b> while sliding the wafer W, which is held by the polishing head <b>3</b>, against the polishing pad <b>5</b> and rotating the turn table <b>2</b> and the polishing head <b>3</b>. The polishing agent supply mechanism <b>4</b> can switch several types of polishing agent successively during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0037">It is to be noted that in the primary polishing, a double side polishing machine may be used, for example. The double side polishing machine is equipped with upper and lower turn tables, a carrier which has a hole for holding a wafer, and a sun gear and internal gear for rotating the carrier between the upper and lower turn tables.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0038">At the time of the polishing, the wafer is held by the carrier in an interposed state between the upper and lower turn tables, and the polishing agent is dropped between the upper and lower turn tables while rotating in opposite directions to one another, and the carrier also rotates and revolves, whereby both the front and back surfaces of the wafer are polished simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0039">In addition, in the final polishing, a single side polishing apparatus may be used as in the secondary polishing. A different polishing pad to that in the secondary polishing may be used, and a different polishing agent may be supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">It is to be noted that the apparatuses themselves used in the primary polishing, secondary polishing, and final polishing may be, for example, the same as conventional ones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041">Next, the inventive polishing method is described. An example of the process of the inventive polishing method is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the process is roughly formed of three parts, primary polishing, secondary polishing, and final polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">[Regarding Primary Polishing]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">Firstly, regarding the primary polishing, this process itself is not particularly limited, and for example, the same double side polishing machine as is conventional may be used, and the wafer may be subjected to double side polishing under polishing conditions the same as is conventional (types of polishing pad and polishing agent, polishing load, rotating speed of upper and lower turn tables, polishing duration etc.). These may be determined appropriately so as to obtain the desired quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">[Regarding Secondary Polishing]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">Next, the secondary polishing is described. The secondary polishing includes polishing by an alkaline based polishing agent and rinse polishing performed subsequently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">(Polishing by an Alkaline Based Polishing Agent)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044">In the secondary polishing, in the polishing by an alkaline based polishing agent which is performed first, an alkaline based polishing agent which includes free abrasive grains and does not include a water-soluble polymer agent is used. As the free abrasive grains, for example, colloidal silica which is often used and can be relatively easily prepared may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0045">As colloidal silica, those with an average primary particle size of, for example, about 38 nm by a BET method may be used. This is because if the primary particle size of the colloidal silica is less than 20 nm, surface roughness is improved but the polishing rate is lowered and productivity becomes liable to degradation. In addition, since silica becomes liable to agglomerate, surface defects tend to increase as well. On the other hand, if the primary particle size is 50 nm or more, surface roughness becomes liable to degradation. Therefore, the primary particle size of the colloidal silica is preferably within the range of 20 nm to 40 nm considering productivity, surface roughness, and surface defects. By using colloidal silica of such a range, productivity can be further increased and surface roughness and surface defects can be more effectively improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0046">In addition, if the pH of the polishing agent becomes lower than 9, the zeta potential of the colloidal silica comes near 0 and the repulsive force between particles weakens, which makes aggromeration more liable to happen. On the other hand, if the pH becomes higher than 12, the colloidal silica becomes liable to dissolve into the solution. Due to the above, it is preferable to adjust the pH of this alkaline based polishing agent so as to fit within the range of 9 to 12, and it is more preferable to adjust within the range of 10 to 11. Adjustment of pH may be performed by adding a KOH solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0047">In addition, concerning other polishing conditions such as polishing load, they may be determined on each occasion depending on the desired quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">(Rinse Polishing)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0048">Next, the polishing agent is switched and the rinse polishing is performed. This rinse polishing includes two stages of polishing. These are the first stage of the rinse polishing in which a polishing agent which includes a water-soluble polymer agent is used, and the second stage of the rinse polishing in which a polishing agent whose water-soluble polymer agent has an average molecular weight larger than the polishing agent of the first stage is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0049">It is to be noted that the water-soluble polymer agent is not particularly limited, but for example, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) may be used. These are often used as rinse polishing agents and can efficiently protect or improve surface roughness of the wafer. The following description will take a case using hydroxyethyl cellulose as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0050">Firstly, regarding the first stage of the rinse polishing, it has been observed that when polishing is performed while supplying a switched polishing agent which includes hydroxyethyl cellulose which has an average molecular weight of, for example, 200,000 or more and less than 700,000, wafer surface roughness can be effectively improved. In addition, degradation in the number of minute defects after the secondary polishing and after the final polishing can be more effectively prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0051">At this time, in order to avoid losing productivity as much as possible, the polishing load, the turn table rotating speed, and the polishing head rotating speed are preferably under the same conditions or within ±30% of the conditions when alkaline based polishing agent is used before being switched to the rinse polishing agent. In addition, on improving surface roughness, it is preferable to polish under the above conditions for 7 seconds or more, and it is more preferable to polish for 10 seconds or more. By performing the first stage of the rinse polishing under such polishing conditions, even better results concerning improvement of productivity and surface roughness can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0052">Subsequently, the second stage of the rinse polishing is performed while supplying a switched polishing agent which includes hydroxyethyl cellulose which has a molecular weight of 700,000 or more and 1500,000 or less. By using hydroxyethyl cellulose which has such an average molecular weight, protective performance on the wafer surface by the hydroxyethyl cellulose can be further enhanced, and generation of partial etching of the wafer surface (slurry burn) and DIC defects can be effectively prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0053">In this case, in order to reduce mechanical action on the wafer and prevent surface defects, the polishing is preferably performed with the polishing load, the turn table rotating speed, and the polishing head rotating speed reduced by 30% or more from the conditions when the alkaline based polishing agent is used (that is, under conditions of 70% or less of the conditions at the time of the polishing by the alkaline based polishing agent), and it is more preferable to reduce by 50% or more. As for the lower limit, it may be, for example, anything greater than 0% of the conditions at the time of the polishing by the alkaline based polishing agent. In addition, since surface protection is the object, the polishing duration is preferably 20 seconds or less and more preferably 15 seconds or less. In this way, the wafer surface can be protected well enough by hydroxyethyl cellulose and degradation of surface quality can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of the change in polishing load in the above polishing method. In this example, in the first stage of the rinse polishing, the condition is the same as the one when the alkaline based polishing agent is used, and in the second stage of the rinse polishing, it is about 50% of the one when the alkaline based polishing agent is used. By adopting such polishing conditions, the above stated effects can be obtained with even more certainty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0055">In addition, it is desirable to include free abrasive grains such as colloidal silica in the first stage rinse polishing agent in order to promote polishing. However, as a result of research, since the free abrasive grains in the alkaline based polishing agent remain on the polishing pad for a while after switching the polishing agent from the alkaline based polishing agent to the first stage rinse polishing agent, itis not absolutely necessary to include free abrasive grains in this first stage rinse polishing agent. However, since the influence of the remaining abrasive grains is lost if the polishing duration is 30 seconds or more, the duration of the first stage of the rinse polishing is desirably 30 seconds or less when the first stage rinse polishing agent does not include colloidal silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0056">The second stage rinse polishing agent does not need to include free abrasive grains from the object of protecting the wafer surface, but even if they are included, there are no problems regarding quality. If they are not included, improvement is possible regarding costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0057">At this point, the polishing pad used in the secondary polishing etc. and flatness will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0058">Conventionally, to counter problems of minute defects and DIC defects, in primary polishing or secondary polishing, it has been common in conventional rinse polishing to use a rinse polishing agent whose hydroxyethyl cellulose has an average molecular weight of about 700,000 to 2,000,000, and as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to polish for a short time with the wafer polishing load and the polishing pad rotating speed reduced so as not to increase surface defects and to ensure good surface protective performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0059">On the other hand, in the subsequent final polishing, for the object of suppressing surface defects, a polishing agent which includes hydroxyethyl cellulose with an average molecular weight of 200,000 or more and less than 700,000 is used. Furthermore, in order to ensure surface protective performance by hydroxyethyl cellulose, the wafer polishing-load is reduced using a soft polishing pad, and the turn table rotating speed and the polishing head rotating speed are reduced, whereby mechanical action in polishing has been reduced and fewer surface defects and good surface roughness have been ensured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0060">Incidentally, as one quality of a wafer, surface roughness has been repeatedly referred to. Among surface roughness, a type which has a spatial wavelength of a few microns or less called haze is emphasized. This is because, in a surface defect testing apparatus, if the haze level is undesirable, the ratio of the signal strength that can be obtained from the defects on the wafer to the signal strength of the noise (haze) component of the wafer (S/N ratio) becomes small, which hinders minute defect detection. Haze is measured with, for example, SP2 made by KLA Tencor Co., Ltd. etc., and the average value of the whole surface is used as a representative value of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0061">However, in recent years, it has been observed that, besides haze, surface roughness which has a spatial wavelength of about a few microns to 50 microns affects the yield when manufacturing devices, and has come to attract attention. Such surface roughness is measured with, for example, TMS3000 RC made by Schmitt Measurement Systems Inc. and the average value of the whole surface is used as a representative roughness of the wafer. Wafer surface roughness of this region can be improved by using a soft polishing pad, and for example, by increasing polishing stock removal in the final polishing which uses a soft polishing pad, it is considered possible to improve this type of wafer surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0062">However, increasing the polishing stock removal using such a soft polishing pad causes the problem of increasing the stock removal of a peripheral portion of the wafer and degrading wafer flatness. This is thought to be caused by the following. The wafer which has received polishing load sinks into the soft polishing pad, which raises the repulsive force that the peripheral portion of the wafer receives from the polishing pad, which results in further promotion of polishing of the peripheral portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0063">As stated above, usually, a hard polishing pad is often used in the secondary polishing, and in this point, a hard one may be suitably used similarly in the secondary polishing of the present invention as well. In a secondary polishing which uses such a hard polishing pad, flatness not degraded even if the polishing duration is extended in the first stage of the rinse polishing with the switched polishing agent after the polishing by the alkaline based polishing agent in order to improve surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0064">Thus, in the conventional method, the attempt to improve surface roughness by changing the conditions of the final polishing which uses a soft polishing pad leads to degradation of flatness, but in the present invention, there is not even the need to change the conditions of the final polishing. In addition, in the secondary polishing in which a hard polishing pad is generally used, surface roughness can be improved without losing flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">[Regarding Final Polishing]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0065">The process of the final polishing itself is not particularly limited, and for example, the same single side polishing apparatus as is conventional may be used, and the wafer may be subjected to single side polishing under polishing conditions the same as is conventional (types of polishing pad and polishing agent, polishing load, turn table rotating speed, polishing head rotating speed, polishing duration etc.). These may be determined appropriately so as to obtain the desired quality. It is to be noted that there is also no need to increase the polishing stock removal in the final polishing which uses a soft polishing pad as is conventional, and flatness is not lost either.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0066">Above has been described in detail the inventive polishing method, and by performing the secondary polishing as described above, the surface roughness after the secondary polishing can be improved without degrading wafer flatness or surface defects. In addition, as a result of the roughness after the secondary polishing being improved, surface roughness after the final polishing can also be improved without changing the final polishing conditions.</div>
