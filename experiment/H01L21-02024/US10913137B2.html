<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for polishing a silicon wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, semiconductor devices have been advanced remarkably toward miniaturization, weight reduction, and higher integration. Accordingly, wafers to constitute the matrix have been promoted to be higher in quality and larger in diameter such that some of them come to have a diameter of more than 300 mm, and demands for improving wafers in flatness and surface roughness get more and more strict.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The previous polishing have mainly been performed by a method using a polishing apparatus equipped with a turn table having a polishing pad attached thereto, a polishing head to hold a wafer from its back surface, and a nozzle to supply a slurry, in which method the wafer surface is brought into sliding contact with the polishing pad using the polishing head while rotating the turn table and the polishing head and supplying a slurry onto the polishing pad (see Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Previously, polishing has been performed including the first stage to process a wafer precisely in flatness while supplying a slurry that contains abrasive grains, together with the second stage to process the wafer precisely in surface conditions (roughness, scratches, particles, etc.) while supplying a slurry that contains a polymer without containing abrasive grains. In these styles to perform polishing in a plurality of stages, the polishing conditions such as the rotation rate of the turn table and so on have always been constant.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have researched on polishing including the first stage and the second stage described above to find that the ΔESFQRmax between before and after polishing is in a relation of trade-off to the surface roughness relating to the rotation rate of a turn table (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Incidentally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing the relative value of surface roughness (left axis) and the relative value of ΔESFQRmax (edge flatness, right axis) standardized on the basis of the values when the rotation rate of the turn table is triple-speed. Even in such a relation, the polishing technology is required to improve both of the properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention was accomplished in view of the above-described issues.

<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, it has been required for a method for polishing a silicon wafer that can achieve both of higher flatness and reduction in surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The present inventors have further investigated to find that the flatness is dominantly influenced by the polishing temperature in the first stage (the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step), supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing an abrasive grain only, and the surface roughness is dominantly influenced by the polishing temperature in the second stage (the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step), supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing a polymer only. Accordingly, the polishing conditions to achieve both of flatness and improvement in surface roughness are determined by polishing while monitoring the surface temperature of the polishing pad by infrared ray to set the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step for polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Then the present inventors have found that both of higher flatness and reduction in surface roughness can be achieved by controlling the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step to be higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step by 2° C. or more; thereby arriving at the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">That is, the present invention provides a method of polishing a silicon wafer, the method comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">a first polishing step of polishing a surface of the silicon wafer by bringing the silicon wafer held by a polishing head into sliding contact with a polishing pad attached to a turn table while supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing an abrasive grain onto the polishing pad, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">a second polishing step of polishing the surface of the silicon wafer by bringing the silicon wafer into sliding contact with the polishing pad while supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing a polymer without containing an abrasive grain onto the polishing pad,

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0028">Hereinafter, the method for polishing a silicon wafer will be described specifically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0029">In the present invention, a single side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> may be used as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, equipped with a turn table <b>2</b> having a polishing pad <b>1</b> attached thereto, together with a polishing head <b>3</b> to hold a wafer W. This single side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> is configured to polish the surface of the wafer W by bringing the wafer W held by the polishing head <b>3</b> into sliding contact with the polishing pad <b>1</b> while supplying a polishing agent (slurry) from the nozzle <b>4</b> onto the polishing pad <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0030">It is to be noted that the polishing apparatus used in the present invention is not limited to that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which depicts an embodiment having two polishing heads <b>3</b> above one turn table. For example, one, three, or more polishing heads may be installed above one turn table. The number of turn table is not particularly limited too, and a plurality of turn tables may be installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0031">As the polishing pad <b>1</b>, a foamed urethane pad or a non-woven fabric is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0032">In the present invention, to begin with, the first polishing step is performed using such a single side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> to polish the surface of the silicon wafer W by bringing the silicon wafer W held by the polishing head <b>3</b> into sliding contact with the polishing pad <b>1</b> attached to the turn table <b>2</b> while supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing an abrasive grain from the nozzle <b>4</b> onto the polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0033">As the polishing agent (slurry) in the first polishing step, an aqueous alkaline solution containing an abrasive grain is used. An illustrative example of the aqueous alkaline solution includes an aqueous KOH solution. As the abrasive grain, colloidal silica is preferable. Any aqueous alkaline solution containing an abrasive grain may be used, however, and the types of abrasive grain and aqueous alkaline solution are not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0034">Then, the second polishing step is performed to polish the surface of the silicon wafer W by bringing the silicon wafer W into sliding contact with the polishing pad <b>1</b> while supplying an aqueous alkaline solution containing a polymer without containing an abrasive grain onto the polishing pad <b>1</b>. The present invention is characterized by controlling the surface temperature of the polishing pad to polish a silicon wafer in such a way that the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step is higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step by 2° C. or more (i.e., ΔT≥2° C. in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). When the surface temperature of the polishing pad is controlled in this way, it is possible to achieve both of higher flatness and reduction in surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0035">The polishing agent used in the second polishing step is an aqueous alkaline solution containing a polymer without containing an abrasive grain (e.g., colloidal silica). Illustrative examples of the polymer include the one absorbed onto a wafer, such as hydroxyethyl cellulose. As the aqueous alkaline solution, aqueous ammonia may be exemplified. However, the types of the polymer and the aqueous alkaline solution are not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0036">The surface temperature of the polishing pad is not particularly limited in the first polishing step and in the second polishing step if they are controlled in such a way that the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step is higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step by 2° C. or more. For example, they can be a predetermined temperature in the range of 25 to 35° C. Each polishing time may be set to 2 to 8 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0037">The surface temperature of the polishing pad is preferably controlled while measuring the surface temperature of the polishing pad by an infrared ray. This makes it possible to control the surface temperature of the polishing pad more precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0038">The method is not particularly limited for setting the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step by 2° C. or more. Specifically, the surface temperature of the polishing pad can be controlled by adjusting at least one of the rotation rate of the turn table as well as the flow rate and the temperature of an aqueous coolant flowing into the turn table while measuring the surface temperature of the polishing pad by an infrared ray. For example, the surface temperature of the polishing pad can be increased by 2° C. or more after finishing the first polishing step by increasing the rotation rate of the turn table to increase the friction heat, increasing the temperature of the aqueous coolant, or decreasing the flow rate of the aqueous coolant, which is flowing into the turn table. The transition time (for rising the temperature) from the first polishing step to the second polishing step may be 15 to 30 seconds, for example. As a method for setting the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step higher than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step by 2° C. or more, it is also possible to adjust the flow rate or the temperature of the polishing agent to be supplied, the rotation rate of the polishing head, or the flow rate or the temperature of the aqueous coolant flowing into the polishing head. The surface temperature of the polishing pad can be controlled, however, more easily by adjusting the rotation rate of the turn table to which the polishing pad is attached or the aqueous coolant flowing into the turn table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0039">When the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step is lower than the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step, or when the difference is less than 2° C. between the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the second polishing step and the surface temperature of the polishing pad in the first polishing step, it becomes impossible to achieve both of higher flatness and reduction in surface roughness.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">Hereinafter, the present invention will be more specifically described by showing Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention is not limited to these Examples.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Examples 1 to 2, Comparative Examples 1 to 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041">The single side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was used for polishing the surface of the wafer W by bringing the wafer held by the polishing head <b>3</b> into sliding contact with the polishing pad <b>1</b> attached to the turn table <b>2</b> while supplying a slurry from the nozzle <b>4</b> onto the polishing pad <b>1</b>. As the polishing pad <b>1</b>, a non-woven fabric was used. As the polishing slurry, an aqueous KOH solution containing colloidal silica was used in the first polishing step, and an aqueous ammonia solution containing hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) with the molecular weight of 1,000,000 was used in the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon wafer was polished while supplying an aqueous KOH solution containing colloidal silica (the first polishing step); followed by stoppage of the flow of aqueous coolant for the turn table simultaneously with starting to supply an aqueous ammonia solution containing HEC with the molecular weight of 1,000,000, together with an increase of the rotation rate of the turn table in 15 sec (temperature increasing period); and the second polishing step was performed at a rotation rate, which is a value relative to the rotation rate of the turn table in the first polishing step, shown in Table 1. The surface temperature of the polishing pad had been measured by an infrared ray during the polishing. Table 1 shows the difference between the average temperatures (ΔT) in the first polishing step and in the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">Table 1 shows the temperature difference between the first polishing step and the second polishing step, together with corresponding ΔESFQRmax and the surface roughness measured by using TMS-3000W (manufactured by Schmitt Industries Inc.). The edge flatness was measured by using Wafer Sight manufactured by KLA Tencor Corporation. In calculating the ESFQRmax, zones (another name: Polar Sites) were set to M49 mode with the total sector number of 72 and the sector length of 30 mm (2 mm E.E. (outer circumferential exclusion area)). The ΔESFQRmax represents a difference between before and after polishing.</div>
