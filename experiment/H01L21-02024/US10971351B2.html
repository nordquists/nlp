<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Japanese Application No. 2018-172843, filed on Sep. 14, 2018, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Disclosure</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a wafer surface beveling method, a method of manufacturing a wafer, and a wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A semiconductor device may be manufactured by performing beveling, lapping, etching, double-surface polishing, mirror surface beveling, finishing polishing, and the like on a wafer that is sliced off a single crystal ingot, after which an electrical circuit or the like is formed on a main surface of the wafer in a device process. Herein, “beveling” refers to a treatment in which a chamfered surface is formed on a circumferential edge portion of a wafer using a grindstone for beveling or the like, and “mirror surface beveling” refers to a treatment in which the chamfered surface that is formed by beveling is polished to a mirror state using a polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H11-188590, mirror surface beveling is performed on a beveled wafer. Specifically, with a wafer that has been beveled such that an angle that is formed by the main surface of the wafer and the surface of a chamfered portion of the wafer is approximately 22°, a polishing pad is pressed against the chamfered surface of the wafer such that an angle between the polishing pad and the main surface of the wafer is approximately 450. After beveling, which creates the chamfered surface, the resulting chamfered surface is subjected to mirror polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the mirror polished surface of the chamfered surface of the wafer treated according to the method of Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H11-188590, there is a potential for debris to be generated by the wafer coming into contact with a wafer chuck or a groove within a wafer housing container during a washing step of the wafer and/or any subsequent manufacturing steps.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of example features of the present disclosure only and are presented to illustrate what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the example features. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the example features in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding thereof, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the forms of the example features may be embodied in practice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">When the terms “about” or “substantially” are used in this specification in connection with a numerical value, it is intended that the associated numerical value include a tolerance of ±10% around the stated numerical value. Moreover, when reference is made to percentages in this specification, it is intended that those percentages are based on weight, i.e., weight percentages. The expression “up to” includes amounts of zero to the expressed upper limit and all values therebetween. When ranges are specified, the range includes all values therebetween such as increments of 0.1%. Moreover, when the words “generally” and “substantially” are used in connection with geometric shapes, it is intended that precision of the geometric shape is not required but that latitude for the shape is within the scope of the disclosure. Although the tubular elements of the features may be cylindrical, other tubular cross-sectional forms are contemplated, such as square, rectangular, oval, triangular and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In the drawing figures, the dimensions of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity of illustration. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The same reference numbers indicate the same components throughout the specification. Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the example term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Example features are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized features (and intermediate structures) of example features. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example features should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a shape of a circumferential edge of a wafer obtained via a wafer mirror surface beveling method, according to example features of the present disclosure. In example features, the circumferential edge of the wafer includes an end surface E that is substantially perpendicular to a main surface M of a front surface side of the wafer and to a main surface M<b>2</b> of a rear surface side of the wafer; a top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> that connects the main surface M<b>1</b> to the end surface E; and a bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> that connects the main surface M<b>2</b> to the end surface E. A wafer having the shape illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be obtained by, for example, beveling a wafer that is cut from a single crystal ingot, where both front and rear surfaces are polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, θ<b>1</b> is an angle formed by the main surface M<b>1</b> of the front surface side of the wafer and the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> (hereafter referred to as a “top chamfer angle”). θ<b>2</b> is an angle formed by the main surface M<b>2</b> of the rear surface side of the wafer and the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> (hereafter referred to as a “bottom chamfer angle”). Specifically, in example features, of the angles θ formed by the main surfaces and the chamfered surfaces of the wafer, the angle for the front surface side is defined as θ<b>1</b> and the angle for the rear surface side is defined as θ<b>2</b>. During the beveling process of the wafer, target values for θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be the same or different, and may be in the range of substantially 22° or more to substantially 26° or less. In example features, the range of angle values for θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be established via the shape of the groove in the jig (such as a beveling wheel) that is used during the beveling. In example features, the angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may deviate from the range of 22° or more to 26° or less by ±1° due to friction of the groove in the jig, a polishing machining allowance in double-surface polishing, or the like. When the target values of θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> are greater than 26°, the chamfer angle on the wafer prior to being subjected to the mirror surface beveling is larger, and therefore the reduction or inhibition of the corner burrs is more difficult and is thus reduced. In example features, the values of angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be in the range of 22° to 23°. In example features, the values of angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be equal to substantially 22°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In example features, the label “t” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> refers to the thickness of the circumferential edge of the wafer, and can be set to be substantially between 760 μm and 790 μm. A<b>1</b> indicates a top chamfer width and A<b>2</b> indicates a bottom chamfer width, and A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> can be set to both be substantially equal to between 200 μm and 450 μm. B<b>1</b> indicates a top chamfer thickness and B<b>2</b> indicates a bottom chamfer thickness, and B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> can be set to both be substantially equal to between 80 μm and 240 μm. R<b>1</b> indicates a curvature radius of a top chamfered portion and R<b>2</b> indicates a curvature radius of a bottom chamfered portion, and R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> can both be set to be equal to between 200 μm and 250 μm. BC indicates the length of the end surface in the thickness direction of the wafer, and can be set to be equal to between 300 μm and 600 μm. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a wafer where the length BC is non-zero, but a wafer obtained by the wafer surface beveling method according to example features may also result in a round wafer where BC is equal to 0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are schematic views illustrating a wafer mirror surface beveling device, according to example features of the present disclosure. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the mirror surface beveling device <b>100</b> includes a stage <b>2</b> to which the wafer W is attached, e.g., by adhesion or other method, the stage <b>2</b> being configured to rotate the wafer W attached thereto; a first polishing pad <b>4</b> positioned so as to contact the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> of the wafer W; a second polishing pad <b>6</b> positioned so as to contact the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> of the wafer W; and a slurry supply mechanism <b>8</b> configured to supply a polishing slurry to the circumferential edge of the wafer W, the polishing slurry to be supplied during the polishing of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In example features, the first polishing pad <b>4</b> is provided on an inclined surface <b>10</b>A of a first polishing pad mounting jig <b>10</b>. In example features, the first polishing pad mounting jig <b>10</b>, which includes the first polishing pad <b>4</b> at a surface thereof, is configured to oscillate along a longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>10</b>A, and as a result the first polishing pad <b>4</b> oscillates along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>10</b>A. In addition, the second polishing pad <b>6</b> is provided on an inclined surface <b>12</b>A of a second polishing pad mounting jig <b>12</b>. The second polishing pad mounting jig <b>12</b>, which includes the second polishing pad <b>6</b> at a surface thereof, is configured to oscillate along a longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>12</b>A of the wafer and as a result, the second polishing pad <b>6</b> also oscillates along the inclined surface <b>12</b>A. In this example, the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are positioned facing each other with the wafer W therebetween in a plan view of the mirror surface beveling device <b>100</b>. In example features, the mechanism that causes the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> to oscillate is not particularly limited, and for example a slide mechanism that is driven by an air cylinder, servo motor, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In example features, a polishing pad having a compressibility of substantially 1.5% to 7.5% may be used for the first and second polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>. In example features, a polishing pad having a compressibility of substantially 3.5% to 7.5% may be used for the first and second polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>. Polishing pads having such compressibility are harder polishing pads than a polishing pad used in generic mirror surface beveling which typically have a compressibility or 9% or more, and are capable of preventing portions of the top and bottom chamfered surfaces C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that are near the side of the end surface E of the wafer from being left unpolished, while also reducing or inhibiting over-polishing of the wafer. A material for a polishing pad as discussed above may be, for example, a polyurethane non-woven fabric. In addition, the thickness of the first and second polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> may be in the range of substantially 1.0 mm to 2.0 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In example features, in order to avoid unwanted contact between the stage <b>2</b> and the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> or between the stage <b>2</b> and the first and second polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> when the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> oscillate during polishing of the wafer, the diameter of the stage <b>2</b> holding the wafer may decrease in a direction away from the side to which the wafer W is attached to the stage <b>2</b> and toward the opposite surface of the stage <b>2</b>. Specifically, an angle β formed by a side surface of the stage <b>2</b> and the surface of the stage <b>2</b> on the side to which the wafer W is attached by adhesion is preferably configured to be in the range of substantially 20° or less. In addition, the diameter of the stage <b>2</b> at the surface on the side to which the wafer W is attached by adhesion may be configured to be substantially 4 mm to 10 mm smaller than the diameter of the wafer W. By doing so, the stage <b>2</b> and the first and second polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> can be substantially prevented from interfering with each other without reducing the adhesion force of the polishing pads <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> to the polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Example features of the wafer mirror surface beveling method that can be performed using the mirror surface beveling device <b>100</b> are described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in example features, when the wafer W is rotated by rotation of the stage <b>2</b>, the first polishing pad <b>4</b> is brought into contact, e.g., into constant contact, with the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> of the wafer W, and the second polishing pad <b>6</b> is brought into contact, e.g., into constant contact, with the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> of the wafer W, the first polishing pad mounting jig <b>10</b> oscillates along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>10</b>A and the second polishing pad mounting jig <b>12</b> oscillates along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>12</b>A. In example features, during polishing, a load is applied to the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, along a direction that runs from the circumferential edge of the wafer W to the center of the wafer W, i.e., along a radial direction of the stage <b>2</b>, and the slurry from the slurry supply mechanism <b>8</b> is supplied to the circumferential edge of the wafer W. Due to the oscillation of the first polishing pad mounting jig <b>10</b>, the first polishing pad <b>4</b> also oscillates along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>10</b>A, and due to oscillation of the second polishing pad mounting jig <b>12</b>, the second polishing pad <b>6</b> oscillates along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface <b>12</b>A. Accordingly, the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> is polished, e.g., mirror polished, by the first polishing pad <b>4</b>, and the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> is polished, e.g., mirror polished, by the second polishing pad <b>6</b>. In example features, a rotation speed of the wafer W can be configured to be between substantially 300 rpm and 1500 rpm, a magnitude of the load applied to the first and second polishing pad mounting jigs can be configured to be between substantially 30 N and 60 N, and an oscillation speed can be configured to be between substantially 1 mm/s and 8 mm/s. In addition, a known alkaline slurry containing colloidal silica may be used for the slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in example features, the angle α<b>1</b> between the surface of the first polishing pad <b>4</b> and the main surface M<b>1</b> of the wafer W during the mirror surface beveling process is equal to or less than the top chamfer angle θ<b>1</b> of the wafer W. In example features, the angle α<b>2</b> between the surface of the second polishing pad <b>6</b> and the main surface M<b>2</b> of the wafer W during the mirror surface beveling process is equal to or less than the bottom chamfer angle θ<b>2</b> of the wafer W. Hereafter, advantages of the above relationship between the angles α<b>1</b> and θ<b>1</b>, and between the angles α<b>2</b> and θ<b>2</b>, respectively, are described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a magnified illustration of the intersection between the first polishing pad <b>4</b>, the main surface M<b>1</b> and the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the angle θ<b>1</b> between the top chamfered surface C<b>1</b> and the main surface M<b>1</b> is shown, as well as the angle α<b>1</b> between the main surface M<b>1</b> and the surface of the first polishing pad <b>4</b> during the mirror surface beveling process. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the relationship between angles θ<b>1</b> and α<b>1</b> is illustrated, where α<b>1</b> is smaller than θ<b>1</b>. In example features, a similar relationship exists at the intersection between the second polishing pad <b>6</b>, the main surface M<b>2</b> and the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b>. Specifically, the angle α<b>2</b> between the main surface M<b>2</b> and the surface of the second polishing pad <b>6</b> during the mirror surface beveling process is smaller than the angle θ<b>2</b> between the bottom chamfered surface C<b>2</b> and the main surface M<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In conventional mirror surface beveling, the angle α formed by the main surface of the polishing pad and the main surface of the wafer during the mirror surface beveling process is typically larger than the chamfer angle θ. This is because when the angle α is configured to be too small, a region spanning several hundred micrometers (μm) or more towards the center of the wafer from a boundary between the main surface and the chamfered surface may potentially be over-polished. Although over-polishing may be reduced by conventional methods, a typical challenge in such conventional method in which corner burrs are formed at the boundary between the main surface of the wafer and the chamfered surface is that the polishing at the boundary is insufficient, which may cause debris to be produced during the final washing of the wafer or during subsequent or other steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to avoid the above disadvantages of the conventional polishing methods, example features have an angle α that is configured to be smaller than in the conventional methods, and such a smaller angle α results in a substantial reduction of the over-polishing. Moreover, example features have the angle α to be equal to or less than the chamfer angle θ at the time of beveling, which results in reducing or inhibiting the creation of corner burrs while also limiting over-polishing to an acceptable level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C</figref> illustrate methods of quantifying corner burrs, according to example features of the present disclosure. The corner burrs in example features can be quantified with the following method. First, using a known laser microscope, a surface shape of a wafer is scanned in a diameter or radial direction. Specifically, a scanning direction is designated as the X axis; a position that is 400 μm to 600 μm closer to the center than an outer circumferential edge of the main surface of the wafer is designated as a starting point of the scan (X coordinate origin point); and a position that is 100 μm to 300 μm closer to the center than the outer circumferential edge of the wafer is designated as an end point of the scan. Accordingly, a contour curve (f(x)) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> can be obtained. Next, using a known analysis method, the second derivative of the contour curve (f(x)) is found for x, thereby obtaining a second derivative curve (f″(x)) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Next, of the peaks exhibited in the second derivative curve (f′(x)), a peak having a maximum depth (hereafter referred to as the “maximum peak”) is derived. In example features, the depth of the maximum peak is designated as “d,” and the X coordinates for the intersections of y=−d×60% and y=f′(x) are designated as “x<b>1</b>” and “x<b>2</b>,” respectively. In example features, the contour curve (f(x)) in a region where x<b>1</b>≤x≤x<b>2</b> is fitted to a circle, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, using a known analysis method. The size of a radius of the circle illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> that is fitted as discussed above is used as an indicator of corner burrs. In example features, the larger the radius of the fitted circle, the more reduced or inhibited the corner burrs at the boundary between the main surface and the chamfered surface of the wafer. When scanning the main surface M<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the radius of the fitted circle illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, calculated in micrometers (μm), is indicative of and proportional to the reduction or inhibition of corner burring at the front surface/chamfer boundary. In example features, when scanning the main surface M<b>2</b>, the radius of the circle illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, also measured in μm, is also indicative of and proportional to the reduction or inhibition of corner burring at the rear surface/chamfer boundary. In example features, in a region where x≥230 μm, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show a fluctuation of the curves f(x) and f″(x), but these fluctuations are due to noise and bear no relevance to the surface shape of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In example features, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, during the beveling process of the wafer, target values for the top chamfer angle θ<b>1</b> and the bottom chamfer angle θ<b>2</b> may be within the range of substantially 220 or more to 26° or less. In example features, the angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be within the range of substantially 22° or more to 23° or less. In example features, the angles θ<b>1</b> and θ<b>2</b> may be equal to substantially 22°. In such a case, with further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, by setting the angle α<b>1</b> at substantially 22° or less, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 180 μm or more. Furthermore, by setting the angle α<b>2</b> at substantially 22° or less, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the rear surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 180 μm or more. Moreover, by setting the angle α<b>1</b> to substantially 21° or less, corner burrs can be reliably reduced or inhibited, even when the chamfer angle θ<b>1</b> of the wafer used in the surface beveling varies. For example, even when θ<b>1</b> is equal to substantially 22°±1° due to variation in the chamfer angle, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 20° μm or more. Moreover, by setting the angle α<b>2</b> to substantially 21° or less, corner burrs can be reliably reduced or inhibited even when the chamfer angle θ<b>2</b> of the wafer resulting from the surface beveling varies. For example, even when θ<b>2</b> is equal to substantially 22°±1° due to variation in the chamfer angle, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the rear surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 200 μm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In example features, from the viewpoint of restricting over-polishing on the front surface side of the wafer W to an acceptable level, setting the angle α<b>1</b> to substantially 20° or more is advantageous. In example features, from the viewpoint of restricting over-polishing on the rear surface side of the wafer W to an acceptable level, setting the angle α<b>2</b> to substantially 20° or more is advantageous. The statement that “over-polishing is at an acceptable level” means that an ESFQRmax is equal to substantially 45 nm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">“ESFQRmax,” as it appears in the instant specification, is determined based on an edge site front least squares range (ESFQR), as defined in the SEMI standard M67. Specifically, an annular region of between 1 and 30 mm from the outer circumferential end of the wafer, following the diameter direction, is divided into 72 wedge-shaped sectors along a circumferential direction of the wafer. Then, from a thickness distribution within each wedge, a positive maximum displacement amount and a negative maximum displacement amount from a reference plane that is found using the least squares method are taken as absolute values, and the sum thereof is designated as the ESFQR for each sector. Then, the largest of these ESFQRs is designated as the ESFQRmax.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In other words, when al is set to substantially 20° or more to 22° or less, the ESFQRmax can be configured to be equal to substantially 45 nm or less while the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary can be configured to be equal to substantially 180 μm or more, and when α<b>1</b> is set to substantially 20° or more to 21° or less, the ESFQRmax can be configured to be equal to substantially 45 nm or less while the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary can be configured to be equal to substantially 200 μm or more. Similarly, when α<b>2</b> is set to substantially 20° or more to 22° or less, the ESFQRmax can be configured to be equal to substantially 45 nm or less while the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the rear surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 180 μm or more, and when α<b>2</b> is set to substantially 20° or more to 21° or less, the ESFQRmax can be equal to substantially 45 nm or less while the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the rear surface/chamfer boundary can be equal to substantially 200 μm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the foregoing description, the above example features are relied on to describe a wafer mirror surface beveling method. However, the example features are not limited to the examples discussed and described above, and appropriate modifications are possible within the scope of the patent claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in example features, wafer surface beveling, or wafer mirror surface beveling, can be performed using a mirror surface beveling device described below. Specifically, the mirror surface beveling process can be performed using a wafer mirror surface beveling device that is provided with a stage configured to be attached to a wafer and to hold the wafer, and a polishing pad mounting jig in which a polishing pad is applied to a surface of the jig that is inclined with respect to the main surface of the wafer, the polishing pad mounting jig being configured to oscillate along a longitudinal direction of the inclined surface. In example features, when the inclined surface of the polishing pad mounting jig is at an angle α with respect to the main surface of the wafer, the polishing pad being in constant contact with the chamfered surface of the wafer that is held on the stage, the polishing pad mounting jig is displaced along the circumferential direction of the wafer while oscillating along the longitudinal direction of the inclined surface, and the wafer is stationary. That is, this example surface beveling method differs from the beveling method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in that the wafer is fixed in place without rotating while the polishing pad mounting jig is displaced along the circumferential direction of the wafer. In all other respects, the subject matter described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> applies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, an example is described of a wafer manufacturing method according to example features. The wafer manufacturing method according to example features includes surface beveling the wafer using the wafer beveling method described above. Specifically, a wafer is first obtained by slicing a single crystal ingot. Next, using a known grindstone for beveling, the wafer is beveled and a wafer having a chamfered surface is obtained. Next, lapping, followed by etching, are performed on the wafer having the chamfered surface. Next, double-surface polishing of the wafer is performed using a double-surface polishing device. Next, mirror surface beveling of the wafer is performed using the mirror surface beveling method described above. Next, finishing polishing of the wafer is performed using a single-surface polishing device. Next, washing of the wafer is performed using a washing method. In example features, the amount of polishing performed during the finishing polishing is slight, and therefore the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the rear surface/chamfer boundary, and the value of the ESFQRmax do not substantially fluctuate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0078">The following evaluation method is used to evaluate corner burrs, over-polishing, and light point defects (LPD) for each silicon wafer obtained in each of the Exemplary Disclosures and Comparative Examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0079">&lt;Evaluation of Corner Burrs&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0080">The corner burrs are evaluated by calculating the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition at the front surface/chamfer boundary (hereafter abbreviated as “the degree of corner burring inhibition”) by the noted method. The evaluation results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Using a VK-X200 manufactured by Keyence Corporation as the laser microscope, a position that is 400 μm closer to the center than the outer circumferential end of the front surface of the wafer is designated as the start point of the scan, and a position that is 100 μm closer to the center than the outer circumferential end of the wafer is designated as the end point of the scan. In addition, the least squares method is used for the fitting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0081">&lt;Evaluation of Over-Polishing&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0082">Using a flatness measuring device (Wafersight 2, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation), the ESFQR of each silicon wafer is measured and the ESFQRmax is calculated with the method described above. The evaluation results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0083">&lt;Evaluation of LPD&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0084">Each silicon wafer obtained in each of the Exemplary Disclosures and Comparative Examples is chucked 1000 times onto a wafer chuck of a robot hand for wafer transport (stress evaluation), after which measurement is made in a DCO mode with a laser particle counter (SP-3, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation), and a number of LPDs with a size of 35 nm or more is found.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0085">(Description of Evaluation Results)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0086">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in Comparative Examples 1 to 3, the angle α<b>1</b> is set to be larger than the target value of the angle θ<b>1</b>. Therefore, the ESFQRmax is reduced to 45 nm or less, and it is possible to reduce or inhibit over-polishing. However, the degree of corner burring inhibition is less than 180 μm and it is not possible to reduce or inhibit the corner burrs. Meanwhile, in Exemplary Disclosures 1 to 3, it is possible to accomplish both a reduction in the ESFQRmax to 45 nm or less and a reduction of over-polishing to an acceptable level, regardless of whether the angle α<b>1</b> is set to be equal to or less than the target value of the angle θ<b>1</b>. Moreover, in Exemplary Disclosure 1, the degree of corner burring inhibition is 180 μm or more and it is possible to reduce or inhibit corner burrs, while in Exemplary Disclosures 2 and 3 the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition is 200 μm or more and it is possible to further reduce or inhibit corner burrs. In Exemplary Disclosure 4, although the degree of corner burring inhibition is favorable, the angle α<b>1</b> is configured to be too small, and therefore the ESFQRmax exceeds 45 nm, and it is not possible to reduce or inhibit over-polishing to an acceptable level. It is similarly possible to reduce or inhibit corner burrs for the rear surface, as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0087">In addition, with respect to LPDs, in Comparative Examples 1 to 3, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition is less than 180 μm, and therefore there are between 2 and 10 LPDs per wafer. This is caused by the occurrence of debris at the time of chucking. In contrast, in Exemplary Disclosure 1, the degree of corner burring inhibition is 180 μm or more, and therefore there is one LPD per wafer, and the occurrence of debris is reduced or inhibited. Also, in Exemplary Disclosures 2 to 4, the degree of corner burring reduction or inhibition is 200 pin or more, and therefore there are between 0.1 and 0.7 LPDs per wafer, and the occurrence of debris is further inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating a relationship between the degree of corner burring inhibition and the flatness, according to example features. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the example features having a degree of corner burring inhibition measured in micrometers (μm) that are equal to or less than substantially 230 μm exhibit an advantageous combination of reduction or inhibition of corner burring and flatness. However, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the degree of corner burring inhibition is greater than substantially 230 μm, then the flatness of the wafer becomes greater than substantially 45 nm, and thus becomes undesirable. As a result, a desired range of degree of corner inhibition is between substantially 180 μm and 230 μm, which results in a wafer in which corner burrs at the boundary between the main surface of the wafer and the chamfered surface are reduced or inhibited.</div>
