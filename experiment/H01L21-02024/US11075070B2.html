<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a monocrystalline semiconductor wafer having a low roughness R<sub>a </sub>and an outstanding flatness in a region adjoining the edge. The invention also relates to a multi-stage method suitable for producing such semiconductor wafers.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Monocrystalline semiconductor wafers, e.g. silicon wafers, which are used for the production of electronic components, must have an extremely flat surface. Otherwise the structures in the nanometer range cannot be imaged sharply on the surface during photolithography. The requirements with regard to flatness constantly increase on account of the miniaturization of the electronic components that is advancing ever further. In this case, that region of the silicon wafer which directly adjoins the edge can be leveled with particular difficulty on account of a wide variety of effects. Double-side polishing is a suitable method for achieving extremely flat silicon wafers having good local geometry values in the edge region in mass production. By way of example, given an edge exclusion of 1 mm an ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>of approximately 30 nm can be achieved. The parameter ESFQR and its determination are defined in the SEMI standard M67-1108. This involves a local flatness value determined on measurement fields arranged radially at the edge of the silicon wafer. The average value of the ESFQR values of all the measurement fields of a silicon wafer is abbreviated to ESFQR<sub>avg</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it is very difficult for the flatness at the edge also to be improved significantly by means of double-side polishing, since various influencing variables such as the flowing of the polishing slurry against the edge and the depression of the polishing pad lead to unavoidable faults. Through suitable selection of process implementation and auxiliaries, it is indeed possible to set the global profile of the processed semiconductor wafer relatively freely from convex to concave. Nevertheless, even with a concave shape overall, it is not possible to avoid a decrease in thickness directly adjoining the wafer edge. The latter directly influences the achievable ESFQR values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Owing to the limitations associated with double-side polishing, a method was developed which makes it possible to improve the flatness of the silicon wafers in a targeted manner and locally. This involves the PACE method (“Plasma Assisted Chemical Etching”). In this case, a plasma etching head a few millimeters in size is guided over the wafer surface at a defined speed, wherein the material removal at a specific position is determined by the residence time of the plasma etching head at the relevant location, i.e. by the speed of the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">EP0798766A1 describes the use of PACE for improving flatness. In this case, after mechanical processing, a semiconductor wafer is firstly polished and then its thickness distribution is measured. On the basis of the results of the location-dependent thickness measurement, the wafer is subsequently subjected to the PACE method, wherein the latter is controlled such that more material is removed at thicker locations than at thinner locations, such that local thickness differences are compensated for. The wafer is then subjected to a haze-free polishing in order to eliminate the roughness and disturbances of the crystal lattice (so-called “damage”) caused by the PACE step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Since roughness and damage after PACE are comparatively high, a large amount of material, for example 3 μm, has to be removed during the subsequent haze-free polishing in order to remove roughness and damage. This is in turn associated with an unavoidable deterioration in the flatness in the outermost edge region of the wafer, such that an arbitrarily good flatness in the edge region cannot be achieved even by means of PACE. Moreover, haze-free polishing, which is always carried out as single-side polishing, cannot in principle achieve good leveling of longer-wave roughnesses (e.g. having a limiting wavelength of 250 μm), particularly if soft haze-free polishing pads are used.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0015">The method according to the invention uses the technique of “Fluid Jet Polishing” (FJP), which is known for the processing of optical glasses, in order to considerably improve the flatness of monocrystalline semiconductor wafers. In contrast to monocrystalline semiconductor wafers, glasses are amorphous solids which do not have an ordered crystal lattice. Disturbances of a crystal lattice structure resulting from the action of the hard substance particles impinging at high speed on the surface to be processed cannot occur in the case of amorphous materials, in contrast to crystalline materials. Surprisingly, however, FJP does not lead to relatively deep crystal lattice damage even in the case of monocrystalline semiconductor wafers. Therefore, it suffices to subject that side of the semiconductor wafer which has been treated by means of FJP to a short haze-free polishing with little material removal, in order to obtain a uniform low roughness and a surface free of damage. The small removal during the haze-free polishing ensures that the flatness as far as the outermost edge that is achieved by means of FJP is impaired only insignificantly by the haze-free polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0016">Consequently, the method according to the invention makes it possible for the first time to produce semiconductor wafers as described herein, which on the one hand have a low roughness typical of polished semiconductor wafers, but on the other hand simultaneously have a flatness as far as the outermost edge that is not achievable by polishing. Even the use of PACE does not lead to this combination of properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0017">The method according to the invention leads directly to a semiconductor wafer as described herein. Preferably, the semiconductor wafer thus has a polished surface without an epitaxial layer deposited thereon. If an epitaxial layer is subsequently deposited, the flatness at the edge can be improved again (slightly) by means of a suitable process implementation. Therefore, the semiconductor wafer according to the invention is also suitable as a substrate for the production of an epitaxially coated semiconductor wafer having outstanding flatness in the edge region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0018">List of Reference Signs Used in the Figures:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019"> <b>1</b> radial profile of a semiconductor wafer after DSP and before FJP</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020"> <b>2</b> radial profile of a semiconductor wafer after FJP</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0021">The semiconductor wafer according to the invention is distinguished by a roughness R<sub>a </sub>(“average roughness”) of 0.8 nm or less, preferably 0.5 nm or less, as is typical of polished semiconductor wafers. The indicated value relates to the average roughness with a limiting wavelength of 250 μm, determined by white light interferometry. At the same time, however, the semiconductor wafer according to the invention has a value ESFQR<sub>avg</sub>—characterizing the flatness in the edge region—of 8 nm or less, preferably of 5 nm or less. By means of haze-free polishing in accordance with the prior art, it is possible to achieve a roughness R<sub>a </sub>of down to 0.2 nm or even 0.1 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0022">Thus, a semiconductor wafer according to the invention is considerably less rough than after PACE processing. On the other hand, at the edge, it is significantly flatter than after double- and single-side polishing in accordance with the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0023">Preferably, a semiconductor wafer according to the invention has a content—determined by means of the poly-UTP method—of at most 3×10<sup>10 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, preferably of at most 1×10<sup>10 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, for each of the two elements copper and nickel. The poly-UTP method is described in the following paragraph. Such low metal concentrations cannot be achieved if processing is carried out by means of PACE. PACE leads to a contamination of the semiconductor wafer with metals such as copper and nickel, which, on account of the high diffusion rate of these metals, is not restricted to the surface of the wafer and therefore cannot be removed by suitable cleaning either.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0024">The poly-UTP method is a method for simultaneously detecting both bulk metals and surface metals. The recovery rate is extremely high. The method is particularly suitable for detecting primarily rapidly diffusing elements such as copper and nickel. In a quartz tube reactor, a polycrystalline silicon layer having a thickness of approximately 1 μm is deposited as external getter on both sides of a silicon wafer to be analyzed. In the course of a further thermal treatment, copper and nickel diffuse from the bulk almost quantitatively to the interface between mono- and polycrystalline silicon. After cooling, the polycrystalline silicon layer is etched away wet-chemically. The etching solution is then evaporated, the residues are redissolved in a mixture of HF/HNO<sub>3 </sub>and dissolved in ultrapure water. The concentrations impurities dissolved in this solution therein are finally determined by means of ICP-MS (“inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry”). The total amount of each individual metal is indicated in the unit of atoms per square centimeter (cm<sup>−2</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0025">The semiconductor wafer according to the invention preferably substantially, i.e. to the extent of 90% (relative to the amount of substance) or more, consists of silicon. It preferably has a circular shape having a diameter of at least 300 mm, even greater diameters of up to 450 mm, for example, also being possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0026">One possibility for producing such semiconductor wafers is afforded by the method described in greater detail below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0027">Preferably, a semiconductor wafer in accordance with the prior art is first produced. For this purpose, generally a single crystal is sliced into wafers (preferably by means of a multiwire saw, MWS). The semiconductor wafers are then processed mechanically (by lapping or grinding or a combination thereof) and chemically (acidic or alkaline etching or a combination thereof).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0028">According to the invention, both sides of the semiconductor wafer thus produced are simultaneously subjected to chemical mechanical polishing. This method step is also known as double-side polishing (DSP) and described, for example, in DE102013201663A1. Preferably, the double-side polishing is associated with an overall material removal of 1 to 20 μm, more preferably 2 to 12 μm. This indicates the sum of the material removal on both sides of the semiconductor wafer, i.e. the resulting decrease in thickness. After the double-side polishing, the surface of the semiconductor wafer preferably has an average roughness R<sub>a </sub>of 0.01 to 0.1 nm at a limiting wavelength of 10 μm and of 0.07 to 0.7 nm at a limiting wavelength of 250 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0029">After double-side polishing has been carried out, the flatness of the semiconductor wafer is improved according to the invention by means of the FJP method. For this purpose, firstly the geometry parameter to be optimized should be defined; secondly, the geometry of the semiconductor wafer after the double-side polishing must be known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0030">For describing the geometry of a semiconductor wafer there exists a large selection of parameters which are defined for the entire semiconductor wafer or for individual sites and differ moreover in how the reference plane for the flatness measurement is defined and how the value of the parameter is calculated from the deviations from this reference plane. What parameter is used as particularly meaningful depends, inter alia, on the subsequent process for producing electronic components and the individual steps thereof. Particularly common geometry parameters are, for example, the parameter GBIR (a global flatness parameter with a reference plane defined by the backside of the semiconductor wafer) and SFQR (a local, site-referenced flatness parameter with a reference plane defined by the front side). A special case is the parameter ESFQR, which is defined in a manner similar to the parameter SFQR, but with radial arrangement of the measurement fields and in a manner restricted to the edge region of the semiconductor wafer. The parameters mentioned are defined in SEMI standards, the ESFQR in the SEMI standard M67-1108. The cited SEMI standard proposes measurement fields having a radial length of 30 mm for the ESFQR. The width of the measurement fields results from a uniform division into 72 sectors of equal size. All ESFQR and ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>values in this description relate to this measurement field definition taking account of an edge exclusion of 1 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0031">In principle, the FJP method can be used for optimizing the geometry of the semiconductor wafer with regard to any arbitrary geometry parameter. If a semiconductor wafer as described herein as having, for example, a surface roughness R<sub>a </sub>of 0.8 nm at a limiting wavelength of 250 nm and an ESFQRave of less than 8 nm with a 1 mm edge exclusion is intended to be produced, for example, then the parameter ESFQR should be used for optimization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0032">The second prerequisite for the geometry optimization by means of the FJP method is that the geometry of the semiconductor wafer after the double-side polishing is known. For this purpose, there are two possibilities which can be used for the method according to the invention:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0033">a) After the simultaneous double-side polishing of each semiconductor wafer, the geometry thereof is measured. This individual measurement is taken as a basis for determining how much material must be removed by means of FJP and at what location of the semiconductor wafer in order to improve the predefined geometry parameter to the desired value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0034">b) If the double-side polishing yields a very highly reproducible result with regard to the geometry of the polished semiconductor wafers, a geometry measurement of each individual semiconductor wafer can also be dispensed with. In this case, it may suffice to calculate the location-dependent material removals for the subsequent FJP method on the basis of data that were obtained from measurements of semiconductor wafers produced in the same way, for example by averaging over a specific number of measured samples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0035">In the next step of the method according to the invention, at least one surface of the semiconductor wafer (generally the surface on which electronic components are produced later) is processed by the FJP method. The FJP method, as a local processing method, is able to remove different amounts of material depending on the position on that surface of the semiconductor wafer which is to be processed, and thus to improve the geometry proceeding from the known geometry after the double-side polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0036">The FJP method is a local material-removing processing using a polishing agent jet. The polishing agent consists of a fluid in which hard substance particles are suspended. The jet is directed onto a small region of the surface with the aid of a nozzle. The nozzle is moved over that part of the surface which is to be treated, wherein the nozzle itself or the semiconductor wafer or both in suitable combination can be moved. By way of example, a rotation of the semiconductor wafer can advantageously be combined with a linear movement of the nozzle. The relative movement of the nozzle in relation to the semiconductor wafer can be effected for example in parallel, straight lines (line by line), spirally or on circular paths parallel to the edge of the semiconductor wafer. A region to be processed can be swept over in each case only once or else multiply or with an overlap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0037">The location-dependent material removal can preferably be controlled by means of the residence duration of the nozzle at a location, i.e. by way of the speed at which the nozzle is moved over the surface of the semiconductor wafer at the location. A comparatively high material removal is effected at low speed of the nozzle, and vice versa. Preferably, the movement of the nozzle is controlled on the basis of the present geometry of the semiconductor wafer after the double-side polishing such that local elevations affecting the geometry parameter to be optimized are removed. The geometry of the semiconductor wafer with regard to the relevant parameter is improved in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0038">Preferably, for the method according to the invention, use is made of a variant of the FJP method which is described for example in WO02/074489A1 and in which the nozzle through which the polishing agent jet emerges is guided over the surface to be processed at a distance of 0.5 to 3 mm, preferably 0.7 to 2 mm, such that an annular gap arises between the end side of the nozzle and the processed surface. The nozzle preferably has a diameter of 4 to 8 mm. The surface area of the annular gap is smaller than the cross-sectional area of the inlet through which the polishing agent flows into the nozzle. The polishing agent accumulates between the nozzle and the surface to be processed and flows predominantly parallel to the surface to be processed through the annular gap substantially radially toward the outside. In this variant, the material removal is predominantly achieved by means of the fluid with suspended hard substance particles that flows radially toward the outside, specifically in a manner spatially delimited to the region of the annular gap, whereas no material removal takes place in the region of the center of the nozzle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0039">An alternative variant of the FJP method achieves a horizontal speed component of the polishing agent through a nozzle arranged obliquely with respect to the polishing surface. This affords the advantage that an increase in the surface roughness as a result of the small material removal in the region of the center of the nozzle in the variant described above is avoided. What is disadvantageous, by contrast, is the loss of the rotational symmetry of the removal profile. However, that can be at least partly remedied by an arrangement of a plurality of nozzles arranged obliquely and aligned exactly or approximately with a common processing point. The flow engineering design of the nozzle arrangement makes it possible to set diverse removal profiles in accordance with the processing demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0040">All variants of the FJP method mentioned here are available as alternatives for the method according to the invention of geometry correction of the semiconductor wafer and in each case offer specific parameter values with regard to the removal rate, the removal profile and the achievable surface roughness. This variant shall be designated hereinafter in summary by the term “FJP method.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0041">If the semiconductor wafer consists substantially of silicon, preferably a slurry of silicon oxide particles having a pH of between 7 and 11.5 is used as polishing agent. The proportion of the silicon oxide particles is preferably 0.1 to 2% (percent by weight). The copper content of the polishing agent is preferably a maximum of 0.04 ppm, and the nickel content is preferably a maximum of 0.1 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0042">Since only a low material removal rate can be achieved with the FJP method, it is preferred not to treat an entire surface (preferably the front side) of the semiconductor wafer, but rather only the partial regions in which the value of the geometry parameter to be optimized turns out to be particularly poor. By way of example, the FJP processing can be restricted to the region adjoining the wafer edge, in order to improve the flatness in the edge region with regard to the parameter ESFQR. An FJP post-processing of the region of the laser marking is also preferred since this region often has a slight elevation after double-side polishing. The elevation can be leveled by means of an FJP processing restricted locally to the region of the laser marking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0043">After the FJP treatment, a renewed geometry measurement can be carried out for the purpose of process control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0044">Afterward, at least the side of the semiconductor wafer which was previously subjected to the FJP treatment is subjected to chemical mechanical polishing. In this case, the differences in roughness between the double-side-polished and FJP-treated regions are removed and the semiconductor wafer acquires a uniformly smooth surface polished in a haze-free manner. This polishing is preferably embodied as single-side polishing, wherein the material removal is preferably not more than 1 μm, and more preferably not more than 0.5 μm. A polishing machine comprising polishing heads having a plurality of rotationally symmetrical pressure zones, as described for example in EP847835A1, is preferably used for this purpose. This together with the small material removal enables substantial maintenance of the flatness set by means of FJP in the edge region of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0045">Particularly preferred embodiments of the method according to the invention are described below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0046">A first particularly preferred embodiment is specifically adapted to improving the flatness in the edge region of the semiconductor wafer in order to optimize the parameter ESFQR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0047">In this embodiment, double-side polishing is preferably carried out such that the semiconductor wafer has the best possible global flatness (i.e. a low GBIR) with a slight elevation in the vicinity of the edge. The GBIR is preferably 200 nm and more preferably 150 nm. At the same time, a comparatively small edge roll-off should already be achieved by the double-side polishing, preferably ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>40 nm and more preferably 30 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0048">This can be achieved for example by means of a suitable choice of the thickness of the carrier plates used for guiding the semiconductor wafers during the double-side polishing in relation to the final thickness of the polished semiconductor wafers: if the final thickness of the polished semiconductor wafers is smaller than the thickness of the carrier plates, then the polished semiconductor wafers have a slightly concave radial profile. An edge roll-off at the outermost edge, i.e. in the region of approximately 3 mm inward from the wafer edge, which limits the ESFQR values achievable by the double-side polishing, cannot be avoided in this case either. However, the double-side polishing is carried out such that this edge roll-off can be removed in the subsequent FJP step with the smallest possible material removal. The material removal during the double-side polishing is preferably 8-10 μm. Curve <b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a radial profile of this type such as is produced by the double-side polishing in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0049">In the subsequent FJP step, it is merely necessary to carry out a geometry correction in the edge region. Since the region to be processed is rotationally symmetrical, it is preferred, during the FJP processing, to move the nozzle in one or more circular paths or spirally over the region to be processed. An FJP processing of the entire front side of the semiconductor wafer can be dispensed with in this embodiment. The elevation in the edge region is preferably removed by means of FJP with the smallest possible material removal to such an extent that the edge roll-off is completely removed and the radial profile as far as the outermost edge either is flat or rises uniformly. Curve <b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a profile corrected in this way by means of FJP. In the case illustrated, with a very small material removal in the FJP step of overall merely approximately 20 mm<sup>3</sup>, the flatness of the edge region can be improved such that an outstanding ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>value of 8 nm or less or even of 5 nm or less can be achieved. The ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>value can be reduced down to approximately 1 to 2 nm. The small material removal provides for a time- and hence cost-saving application of the FJP method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0050">In a second embodiment, the FJP processing is used to improve a profile that is not optimum after double-side polishing. By way of example, as a result of a non-optimum process implementation or on account of unintentional deviations during the double-side polishing, a slightly concave radial profile can arise which has a wider edge roll-off in comparison with the first particularly preferred embodiment. This edge roll-off is likewise completely removed by the subsequent FJP processing. In this embodiment, FJP is used for the post-processing of semiconductor wafers which would otherwise have to be rejected on account of deviations during the double-side polishing. For the rest, this embodiment does not differ from the first particularly preferred embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the radial profile before the FJP processing (curve <b>1</b>) and after the FJP processing (curve <b>2</b>). In this case, a significant improvement of the flatness in the edge region of the semiconductor wafer can already significantly improve the flatness of the edge region with a material removal of only 10 mm<sup>3</sup>, even if an outstanding ESFQR<sub>avg </sub>value of 8 nm or less is not achieved in this case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0051">In a third particularly preferred embodiment, the FJP method is used for removing an elevation at the location of the laser marking, the position and geometry of which can be ascertained after the double-side polishing. Elevations around the laser marking can arise because silicon and silicon oxide have different removal rates during double-side polishing. At the laser marking oxides can arise locally, which slow down material removal during double-side polishing and therefore remain as an elevation. In this case, too, only the region of the laser marking is processed, rather than the entire front side of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0052">In a fourth particularly preferred embodiment, the FJP method is used for removing local disturbances of the surface. These disturbances may be e.g. local elevations that arise in the course of the deposition of a low temperature oxide (LTO) on the backside of the semiconductor wafer. They are referred to as so-called “spikes” and usually arise in the edge region of the semiconductor wafer. In order to be able to remove such local elevations that do not arise reproducibly at the same location, each semiconductor wafer must be subjected to a geometry measurement before the FJP step is carried out.</div>
