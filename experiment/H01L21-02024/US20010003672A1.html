More particularly, the present invention relates to a surface treating composition or a polishing composition which has a high polishing removal rate and is capable of forming an extremely smooth surface by reducing formation of waviness in specular finish of low resistance silicon wafers containing a large amount of a dopant in the wafers and having a resistivity of at most 0.1 Ω·cm. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>

The demand for epitaxial wafers to be used for discrete semiconductors, bipolar IC, MOSIC and other high performance semiconductor devices, is increasing year after year. And, miniaturization in the design rule for semiconductor devices has been advanced year after year, whereby the focal depth in the process for producing devices has been shallow, and the precision of the finished surface required for wafers before forming into devices, has been increasingly strict. <span style="display: none">[0003] </span> </div>

Accordingly, wafers having such surface defects reduced, or a process for producing such waters, is now being studied. <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007">Silicon waters which are typical semiconductor substrates, are prepared by slicing a silicon single crystal ingot to obtain wafers, which are then subjected to rough polishing called lapping, for contour shaping. Then, a damaged layer formed on the wafer surface during the slicing or lapping step, is removed by etching, followed by polishing the wafer surface to a specular surface to obtain silicon wafers. This polishing usually comprises a plurality of polishing steps, specifically a stock removal polishing, a secondary polishing and a finish polishing (final polishing). Depending upon the process, the secondary polishing may be omitted, or a further polishing step may be added between the secondary polishing and the final polishing. <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0008" num="0008">The above silicon single crystal ingot is one having a single crystal of silicon grown by CZ method or FZ method. FZ method has merits such that contamination by impurities is little, and a single crystal having a high resistivity can be grown, but it also has drawbacks such that it is difficult to enlarge the diameter or to control the resistivity, and it has a peculiarity as a method for producing a single crystal. Accordingly, CZ method is mainly used at present. According to CZ method, a single crystal is grown In such a manner that growth of the single crystal is initiated by seed crystals having a predetermined orientation, at a center portion of the surface of a melt of silicon heated and melted in a quartz crucible in a sealed container having a reduced pressure argon gas atmosphere, and the single crystal is withdrawn as an ingot having a desired shape. <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0009" num="0009">It is usually possible to lower the resistivity of wafers, by incorporating antimony, arsenic, boron or other dopants in a larger amount than usual, into the above silicon melt. A wafer having a resistivity of at most 0.1 Ω·cm, is commonly called as a low resistance wafer. The above mentioned epitaxial wafer is one having a thin film of a silicon single crystal (hereinafter referred to as “an epitaxial layer”) free frog crystal defects, grown on the surface of such a low resistance wafer, by a chemical or physical means. <span style="display: none">[0009] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0010" num="0010">When the silicon single crystal is withdrawn in CZ method, the dopant substance in the silicon melt is likely to be relatively easily taken into the single crystal, and as the withdrawing advances, the dopant concentration in the silicon melt decreases. Therefore, for the purpose of making the dopant concentration in the ingot constant, a suitable amount of a silicon melt or a dopant is supplemented to the quartz crucible during the withdrawing, but it is difficult to make the dopant concentration in the withdrawn ingot to be uniform. If an ingot obtained from the melt containing a dopant by such a method, is sliced, nonuniformity in the dopant concentration is likely to appear concentrically. <span style="display: none">[0010] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0011" num="0011">Heretofore, for polishing a usual low resistance wafer, it has been common to employ a polishing composition comprising water, silicon dioxide and a polishing accelerator such as an amine or ammonia. If this polishing composition is used for polishing a low resistance water having a high dopant concentration, concentric waviness (hereinafter referred to as “dopant striation”) corresponding to the nonuniformity in the dopant concentration may form on the wafer surface. Formation of such dopant striation is remarkable in the stock removal polishing where the polishing removal rate is high. In the secondary polishing or the final polishing which is carried out after the stock removal polishing, the polishing removal rate is usually low as compared with the stock removal polishing, and it is difficult to mend the waviness formed in the stock removal polishing by the secondary or subsequent polishing operation. Even if the amount of the polishing accelerator used in the stock removal polishing is reduced for the purpose of reducing formation of such dopant striation, the effects for reducing the dopant striation is small, and another problem that the polishing removal rate lowers substantially, is likely to result. In the actual polishing process, the polishing composition may be used. Repeatedly by recycling, and if the composition may be repeatedly used by recycling in state where the amount of an additive is reduced, there has been a problem that the polishing removal rate decreases substantially. <span style="display: none">[0011] </span> </div>

Namely, in the second and subsequent polishing operation, it is important to be able to reduce the surface roughness and to prevent formation of microprotrusions, micropits and other fine surface defects, rather than to have a large ability to mend waviness or relatively large surface defects as required in the stock removal polishing. Further, from the viewpoint of productivity, it is important that the polishing removal rate is high. As far as the present inventors are aware, in the conventional two step polishing, it has been possible to obtain a wafer surface having small surface roughness in the secondary polishing, but the polishing removal rate used to be very low and inadequate for practical production, and it has been difficult to prevent formation of microprotrusions, micropits and other surface defects. <span style="display: none">[0012] </span> </div>

Especially when the composition of the present invention is used for a second or subsequent polishing operation, particularly for final polishing, it is preferred that the composition contains water-soluble polymer. The wafer surface immediately after polishing has hydrophobicity, and when the polishing composition, dust in air or other foreign matters are deposited on the wafer surface in such a state, the abrasive in the composition or the foreign matters will be dried and solidified to firmly fix on the wafer surface, thus causing deposition of particles on the wafer surface. Whereas, in the polishing composition of the present invention, the water-soluble polymer has function to provide hydrophilicity on the wafer surface so that the wafer surface will not dry up in a short period of time from the completion of the polishing to the subsequent step of cleaning.
