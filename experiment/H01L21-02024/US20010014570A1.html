<div class="abstract" id="A-0001">There is a process for producing a semiconductor wafer having a front surface and a back surface and a polished edge, in which the semiconductor wafer is subjected to polishing on both sides. The process includes the following temporal sequence of steps: (a) polishing of the edge of the semiconductor wafer using a polishing cloth, with an alkaline polishing abrasive being supplied continuously; (b) simultaneous polishing of the front surface and the back surface of the semiconductor wafer, with an alkaline polishing abrasive being supplied continuously, between two rotating, lower and upper polishing plates which are both covered with a polishing cloth, both polishing cloths substantially comprising a porous, homogeneous, fiber-free polymer foam, and the polishing cloth of the lower polishing plate having a smooth surface and the polishing cloth of the upper polishing plate having a surface which is interrupted by channels; immediately followed by: (c) complete wetting of the front surface and the back surface and the edge of the semiconductor wafer with a film of liquid; and (d) cleaning and drying of the semiconductor wafer. There is also a semiconductor wafer which has been polished on both sides, having a front surface and a back surface and a polished edge and a maximum local flatness value SFQR<sub>max </sub>of less than or equal to 0.13 μm, based on partial regions of a surface grid on the front surface of the semiconductor wafer, which has been produced in accordance with this method. </div>

Double-sided polished semiconductor wafers with a polished edge are suitable for use in the semiconductor industry, in particular for the fabrication of electronic components with line widths of less than or equal to 0.13 μm. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>

High flatness levels of this nature can be achieved by means of what is known as double-side polishing as the abrasive polishing step. An apparatus which is suitable for the double-side polishing of semiconductor wafers is described, for example, in DE 19 14 082 B2, U.S. Pat. No. 3,691,694 and EP 8 360 B1. According to one embodiment of double-side polishing, which is described in EP 208 315 B1, semiconductor wafers are moved along a path which is predetermined by the machine and process parameters in carriers. These carriers are made from metal and have suitably dimensioned, plastic-lined cutouts, between two rotating polishing plates, which are each covered with a polishing cloth, in the presence of a polishing abrasive, and are thus polished. The production of a semiconductor wafer with local flatness values which are suitable for 0.13 μm component technology forms the subject-matter of DE 199 05 737 A7 and which discloses an improved double-side polishing process by maintaining tightly defined thickness relationships between carrier thickness and the thickness of the semiconductor wafer after the polishing process. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005">Numerous variations of polishing cloths for mechanically assisting the predominantly chemical polishing of semiconductor wafers (“chemo-mechanical polishing”, CMP) are known and commercially available. In such cloths, a porous side which faces the semiconductor wafer to be polished is generally securely affixed to a supporting substructure. The layer which is active in the polishing process may comprise a homogeneous polymer foam, for example a polyurethane foam. A cloth of this type is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,680 and is referred to in the field as being of the “foam type”. A further variant is a polishing cloth which comprises polymer foam, for example polyurethane foam, reinforced with polymer fibers, for example with polyester fibers (“velour type”). Polishing cloths of this type, which are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,552 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,432, are produced by impregnating a felt consisting of the fibers with a polymer solution and crosslinking. This leads to the felt being completely filled and covered by a porous, soft and elastic polymer layer. An example of a polishing cloth of this type is a polyester felt which is filled and covered with polyurethane. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006">EP 8 360 B1 states that both types of polishing cloths can be used for double-side polishing. The use of homogeneous polyurethane cloths for the double-side polishing of sawn but not edge-polished semiconductor wafers is known from EP 754 785 A1. The geometry values which are attained do not allow wafers of this type to be used for semiconductor components belonging to the technology generations of 0.13 μm and smaller. The significantly more widespread use of polyester-fiber-reinforced polyurethane cloths in double-side polishing is described, for example, in the applications DE 39 26 673 A1, EP 208 315 B1, EP 711 854 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,167 U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,395, DE 199 057 737 A1, DE 199 38 340.5, DE 199 56 250.4 and DE 199 58 077.4. According to the prior art it is possible and described, for example, in EP 8 360 B1 and the German Patent Applications Ser. Nos. DE 199 58 077.4 and DE 199 62 564.6, for one or both polishing cloths to be textured by, for example, holes or channels being formed, in order to adjust the friction and/or adhesion forces during the double-side polishing. A significant shortcoming of the use of polyester-fiber-reinforced polyurethane cloths in double-side polishing is the rapid abrasion of the uppermost polyurethane layer on account of the mechanical attack from the carriers. This leads to the lower cloth layers being exposed and consequently to scratched wafer surfaces and edges, which in turn leads to a low cloth service life and therefore high process costs. Polishing cloths which have been improved, for example, by the incorporation of polymeric microelements, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,164, likewise only withstand the attack from the carriers to a limited extent. Also they can only be produced by complex, expensive production methods. <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007">In particular in order to avoid the adhesion of particles which, during the fabrication of integrated circuits, may lead to the failure of entire components or component assemblies, semiconductor wafers which are to be used for components from the technology generation of 0.13 μm and less must have polished edges. The production of double-side polished semiconductor wafers with polished edges is likewise known. A double-side polishing process with simultaneous polishing of the wafer edge is described in EP 776 030 A2 and EP 940 219 A2. However, it is known to the person skilled in the art that a procedure of this type involves making compromises in terms of throughput and yield. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,539 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,743 it is disclosed that the edge polishing be carried out after the double-side polishing. In this case too, mechanical and chemical deterioration to the double-side polished wafer surfaces leads to huge losses of yield during the edge polishing. This deterioration requires poor-quality wafers of this type to be discarded or expensively remachined, for example as described in the German Patent Application Ser. No. DE 199 56 250.4. <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> </div>

A further essential feature of the invention is that during the double-side polishing in accordance with step (b), polishing cloths made from a porous, homogeneous, fiber-free polymer foam are used. Also the polishing cloth which is stretched over a lower polishing plate has a smooth surface, and the polishing cloth which is stretched over an upper polishing plate has a surface which is interrupted by channels. A third essential feature of the invention is that the semiconductor wafer, in accordance with step (c), is completely wetted with a film of liquid. The fact that the provision of double-side polished semiconductor wafers with polished edges is possible with a considerably increased yield and therefore at reduced manufacturing costs only when all three features are complied with was surprising and not foreseeable. <span style="display: none">[0015] </span> </div>

Materials of this type include, for example, silicon, silicon/germanium and so-called III-V semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide. The process is particularly suitable for the production of monocrystalline silicon wafers with diameters of in particular 200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm and 450 mm and thicknesses of a few hundred μm to a few cm, preferably of 400 μm to 1200 μm. The semiconductor wafers may either be used directly, as starting material for the fabrication of semiconductor components. Or these wafer may be supplied for their intended purpose after a final polishing step according to the prior art has been carried out and/or after the application of layers, such as back surface seals. Or these wafers may be supplied after an epitaxial coating on the wafer front surface, for example with silicon, and/or after a heat treatment, for example under a hydrogen or argon atmosphere. In addition to the fabrication of wafers from a homogeneous material, the invention can also be used for the fabrication of semiconductor substrates of multilayer structure, such as SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafers. <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> </div>

In this case, the edge can be rounded in one step. In the case of a two-step edge rounding being preferred for throughput reasons, a grinding wheel with diamond grains of 400 mesh (grain size range 30-50 μm) to 600 mesh (grain size range 20-30 μm) is used first. This is followed by a grinding wheel with diamond grains of 1000 mesh (grain size range 8-15 μm) to 2000 mesh (grain size range 4-6 μm). <span style="display: none">[0020] </span> </div>

It is thus possible to subject the semiconductor wafer to a mechanical abrasion step, such as lapping or grinding, followed by a wet-chemical or plasma etching process, in order to reduce the material abrasion in the double-side polishing step (b). Sequential surface grinding of the wafer front surface and back surface using a grinding wheel comprising metal- or resin-bonded diamond grains of 400 mesh (grain size range 30-50 μm) to 1000 mesh (grain size range 8-15 μm) is used. This is carried out in combination with an acid etching step in a mixture of concentrated aqueous nitric acid and concentrated aqueous hydrofluoric acid, and is particularly preferred. A particularly preferred starting material is a semiconductor wafer made from silicon with a diameter of greater than or equal to 200 mm. This wafer is produced by wire-sawing of a silicon single crystal followed by edge-rounding, sequential surface grinding of both sides of the wafer, with from 10 μm to 100 μm of silicon being removed on each surface, and wet-chemical etching in an acid etching mixture with from 5 to 50 μm of silicon being removed from each surface. <span style="display: none">[0021] </span> </div>

Polishing is preferably carried out using a commercially available polyurethane polishing cloth with a hardness of from 30 to 70 (Shore A), which may contain reinforcing polyester fibers; suitable polishing cloths are likewise marketed commercially. The procedure may be such that, by rotation of the silicon wafer using an obliquely positioned polishing plate covered with a polishing cloth, firstly one flank, for example the lower flank, of the wafer edge is polished, and then the other flank, for example the upper flank, of the wafer edge is polished. A process of this type is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,477.

For cost reasons, it is sensible for a multiplicity of silicon wafers to be polished simultaneously. The polishing machine substantially comprises a lower polishing plate, which can rotate freely in a horizontal plane, and an upper polishing plate, which can rotate freely in a horizontal plane. Both plates are covered with a polishing cloth, and, with a polishing abrasive which preferably has a similar composition to the polishing abrasive used for step (a) being supplied continuously.

Carriers made from steel or from fiber-reinforced plastics are preferred. Carriers made from stainless chromium steel are particularly preferred, on account of their high dimensional stability and chemical resistance. To prevent damage to the polished wafer edge by the inner edge of the cutout in the carrier during polishing, it is therefore preferred for the inner side of the cutouts to be lined with a plastic coating of the same thickness as the carrier, for example by an extrusion process, as described in EP 208 315 B1. Examples of suitable plastics include polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polytetrafluoroethylene or polyvinylidene difluoride, which are all equally preferred. With a view to maintaining the quality of the edge, it is also preferable for the plastic coating in all the cutouts to be checked for damage prior to each double-side polishing operation and for it to be replaced after a defined period of use, for example of between 100 and 200 polishing runs. <span style="display: none">[0028] </span> </div>

This side facing toward the wafer which is to be polished is, if appropriate, joined to a mechanically more stable supporting layer, which is not active in the polishing process and does not form part of the invention. A polymer foam belonging to the elastomers group or a mixture of polymer foams of this type is preferable for the abrasion of silicon in step (b). Examples of such foams include polyurethane, polyamide, polyether, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl chloride and polycarbonate in different chain lengths and degrees of crosslinking. A polymer foam substantially comprising polyurethane is particularly preferred. In the context of the work aimed at achieving the object of the invention, it was discovered that only homogeneous polymer foams of this type are suitable for providing defect-free wafer surfaces and edges. By contrast, if, for example, polyester-fiber-reinforced polishing cloths were used under the conditions prevailing during double-side polishing, the uppermost polymer foam layer was worn away even after only a few polishing runs. This leads to roughening of the wafer edges and to the wafers affected being lost, and to the need to exchange cloths of this type after only a few polishing runs, for example 10 to 20 polishing runs. By contrast, polishing cloths made from polymer foam achieve a service life of from 100 to 200 double-side polishing runs, and in exceptional cases even greater numbers of runs. Polishing cloths made from polymer foam within the preferred hardness range are now also commercially available. With modern double-side polishing machines with a large diameter, for example of 2 m, it may be necessary to compose the covering for the lower and upper polishing plates of a plurality of pieces, for example two or four pieces: This is described in the German Patent Application Ser.

The upper polishing plate, once the double-side polishing is complete, is sometimes lifted off while rotating. This means that a step of this type, which was originally introduced in order to prevent silicon wafers from sticking to the upper polishing plate, can be dispensed with. The improved distribution of the polishing abrasive used as a result of this texturing is necessary in order to maintain the quality of the polished wafer edges. The channels can be made on the polishing cloth by, for example, a material-removing milling operation. The upper polishing cloth preferably has a regular arrangement of channels, which resembles a chess board, with a square size of from 5 mm×5 mm to 50 mm×50 mm and a channel width and depth of from 0.5 to 2 mm. With this arrangement, polishing is carried out under a polishing pressure of preferably from 0.1 to 0.3 bar. The silicon abrasion rate is preferably between 0.1 and 1.5 μm/min, and particularly preferably between 0.4 and 0.9 μm/min.

The use of a polishing abrasive containing polyvinyl alcohol is described in DE 22 47 067 B2. A polishing abrasive which contains a polymeric additive and a surfactant as film former is known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,055.

While this mixture is being supplied, the polishing pressure is reduced to 0.05 to 0.15 bar while rotation is maintained. This process state is maintained for a period of between 1 and 10 min, with the result that a film of liquid comprising polyvalent alcohol and/or polyalcohol and/or surfactant is formed on the surface and edge of the silicon wafers. Then, in order to wash polishing abrasive off the silicon wafers while at the same time maintaining the film on the surfaces and edges, ultrapure water is supplied, while rotation is continued and while the pressure is reduced further to from 0.02 to 0.10 bar, for a period of from 1 to 10 min. </div>

Gentle removal of the wafers by means of a vacuum nozzle holder as described in the German Patent Application Ser. No. DE 199 58 077.4 is preferred according to the invention. This is because this procedure allows a double-side polishing machine holding, for example, 30 200-mm wafers or 15 300-mm wafers to be unloaded within 2 minutes and at the same time involves acceptable production costs and wafer yields. The silicon wafers picked up by suction in this way are transferred into a receiving device which is situated in an aqueous bath or into a wet tray filler designed for the diameter of the wafers to be received. The aqueous bath used or the wet tray filler may be filled with ultrapure water or with ultrapure water which has been provided with small added quantities of acids and/or oxidizing substances and/or surfactants, in order to further optimize the preservation of the wafer surfaces. <span style="display: none">[0042] </span> </div>

During this assessment, defects which would prevent further processing of the wafer in the component fabrication, for example scratches and spots, are discovered. Particularly for the fabrication of the edge-polished semiconductor wafer according to the invention, it is advisable to subject the edge to microscopic inspection. This is done in order to be able to identify and quantify any deviations which may be present in the polished wafer surface, for example as a result of roughening. A commercially available optic microscope with a resolution of between 10 times and 100 times, which can be used to vertically assess the wafers, which are generally arranged in a lying position, in the edge region is suitable for this purpose. <span style="display: none">[0046] </span> </div>

Double-side polished and edge-polished wafers with flawless surfaces and edges were desired. The single crystals required for this purpose were pulled, cut to length, cylindrically ground and cut, on a commercially available wire saw, into wafers with a thickness which was tailored to the final product, in accordance with the prior art. After the edges had been rounded, a surface grinding step took place on a rotary grinding machine, using diamond grains of 600 mesh (grain size range 20-30 μm), with in each case 30 μm of silicon being removed in succession from the wafer front surface and wafer back surface. This was followed by an acid etching step using the flow etching process, with in each case 10 μm of silicon being abraded from each wafer surface simultaneously as a result of the rotating wafers being immersed in a mixture of 90% by weight concentrated nitric acid (70% by weight in aqueous solution), 10% by weight concentrated hydrofluoric acid (50% by weight in aqueous solution) and 0.1% by weight ammonium lauryl sulfate. The temperature of the etching mixture was controlled at 20° C., and gaseous nitrogen flowed through the mixture. At this point in the process sequence, the thickness of the wafers was 815 μm. The continuation of the process is described below, in which text, in all the examples and comparative examples, where specified, the edge-polishing step is denoted by (a), the double-side polishing step is denoted by (b), the stopping step with film formation is denoted by (c) and the cleaning/drying step is denoted by (d).
