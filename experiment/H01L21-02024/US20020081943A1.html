<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0002" num="0002">This invention relates, generally, to polishing systems and methods to obtain a substantially flat surface profile and, more particularly, to polishing systems and processes using Magnetorheological finishing, MRF. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>
</li> <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0003" num="0003">The increasing need to form planar surfaces in semiconductor device fabrication has led to the development of process technology known as chemical-mechanical-polishing (CMP). In the CMP process, semiconductor substrates are rotated against a polishing pad in the presence of a chemical slurry. As each substrate is rotated against the polishing pad, the force of the polishing pad in conjunction with the action of the polishing slurry polishes away the surface of the substrate. In the slurry, chemical compounds undergo a chemical reaction with the semiconductor substrate to enhance the rate of removal. <span style="display: none">[0003] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">A common requirement of all CMP processes is that the substrate be uniformly polished. Uniform polishing can be difficult because, typically, there is a strong dependence of the polish removal rate on localized variations in the surface topography of the substrate. For example, the polishing rate at the center of substrate may differ from the polishing rate at the edge of the substrate. Uniform polishing of the entire surface of the substrate is important, because semiconductor manufacturers seek to use as much of each substrate as possible in order to maximize the number of integrated circuit devices, IC devices, that can be built on a useable area of the surface of each substrate. <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005">The useable area of a semiconductor substrate is reduced by an unusable region along an edge of the substrate, at a perimeter of the surface, referred to as the edge exclusion area. Prior to the invention, the edge exclusion area was 2 mm-3 mm wide, as measured diametrically from the perimeter of the substrate surface. The edge exclusion area defines a boundary or perimeter that encircles the useable area available for fabrication of IC devices thereon. The useable area is known as the FQA, flatness quality area, which is manufactured by polishing a major surface of a bare silicon wafer to provide a flat planar surface on the wafer, followed by, successive layers of materials that are deposited onto the surface of the wafer, constructed with a damascene architecture of circuit interconnects and conducting vias, and then planarized by respective CMP operations. The planarized layers of damascene architecture are of nonuniform planarity or flatness, particularly at the unusable edge region of the substrate, which contributes further to the edge exclusion area. There has been a need to reduce the edge exclusion area, which would increase the FQA on the wafer for supporting an increased number of manufactured IC devices. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006">The unusable edge region along the edge of a substrate surface is partly due to nonuniform edge polishing of the cylindrical perimeter of a bare silicon wafer, further referred to as, a silicon substrate or semiconductor substrate.

First, the surface of the wafer undergoes a rough polishing operation. Rough polishing intends to provide the wafer surface with a desired global planarity or global flatness. However, as disclosed by FIG. 1, such rough polishing causes an edge effect, on an edge region at the perimeter of a major surface <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> <b>1</b> of the wafer <b>2</b>, that is disclosed as a roll off <b>3</b>. IC devices can not be fabricated on the roll off <b>3</b>, because the roll off <b>3</b> is not flat and coplanar with the central region of the surface <b>1</b>, and further, the roll off <b>3</b> extends below the elevation of the central region of the surface <b>1</b>. It would be desirable to lower the surface <b>1</b> to a lower elevation while maintaining its desired planarity, thus, substantially removing the roll off <b>3</b>, and desirably increasing the total useable area of the surface <b>1</b> on which IC devices can be fabricated. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0026" num="0026">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a semiconductor wafer <span style="display: none">[0026] </span> <b>2</b> is shaped to a flatness of surface <b>1</b> substantially the same degree as that of a glass substrate using an MRF system. High end, prime silicon manufacturers are capable of consistently producing 200 mm wafers with global and site flatness levels to 0.50 μm and 0.20 μm, respectively. A typical site size is 25×25 mm. In contrast to CMP processing, an MRF system is capable of achieving less than about 0.05 μm global flatness, with even lower site flatness. To carry out the process, a wafer fixturing device is attached to the MRF system. The method used to hold or fix a wafer <b>2</b> during any polishing or finishing step is critical to achieve the desired shape or finish. In accordance with the invention, a fixturing device that can be used for positioning a semiconductor substrate or wafer <b>2</b> in an MRF system includes, a vacuum plate (grooved or porous plate, ceramic or metal), an electrostatic chuck, a clamp mount, a template assembly mount and the like. Also, a semiconductor substrate or wafer <b>2</b> can be wax mounted to an appropriate support surface. An MRF process is then carried out to form a uniformly flat surface across the entire surface of the substrate or wafer <b>2</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0027" num="0027">The process includes, positioning a substrate or wafer <span style="display: none">[0027] </span> <b>2</b> having a surface in a fixturing device and contacting the surface <b>1</b> with a magnetorheological fluid in the presence of a magnetic field. The magnetorheological fluid imparts abrasive action on the wafer <b>2</b> by flowing in the magnetic field, such that relative motion of the surface <b>1</b> and the fluid polishes and shapes the surface <b>1</b> with a predetermined site flatness having a nanometer scale topography. Conveying successive portions of the surface <b>1</b> in contact with the fluid distributes the polishing and shaping operations onto successive portions of the surface <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the entire surface <b>1</b> to be polished is in contact with the fluid. The fluid is subjected to a magnetic field having a form field that is mathematically configured to conform the fluid while the fluid polishes and shapes the surface <b>1</b> being polished. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0028" num="0028">In an embodiment of the invention, an MRF system is used to edge polish a bare silicon wafer <span style="display: none">[0028] </span> <b>2</b>, simultaneously polishing a cylindrical perimeter surface <b>4</b> and the edge regional areas on opposing surfaces, including the surface <b>1</b>, on respective sides of the bare silicon wafer <b>2</b>, which reduces the manufacturing time for attaining an edge polished silicon wafer <b>2</b>, as well as, increases the FQA by minimization of the edge effect due to edge polishing. Further, a bare silicon wafer <b>2</b> that has been edge polished by MRF has a perimeter surface <b>4</b> of increased strength to resist breaking off of fragments of particulate material. Further, the surface <b>4</b> has a smooth polished finish to reduce contamination-related defects. The conformal polishing media in an MRF system is used to polish the complete substrate edge (both sides and the perimeter surface <b>4</b>) at one time with good finishing control. </div>

By simultaneously polishing the edge regions on opposing surfaces and the perimeter surface <b>4</b> of the wafer <b>2</b>, the entire edge of the substrate or wafer <b>2</b> is polished at a controlled material removal rate, with a minimized manufacturing time duration. The wafer <b>2</b> is rotated about its central axis to convey successive portions of the wafer <b>2</b> into contact with the fluid, which distributes the polishing and flattening operations over the successive portions of the wafer <b>2</b>.

Prior to the invention, the intermediate polishing operation tended to produce a surface <b>1</b> with waviness, ripples or undulations having spatial wavelengths ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 20 mm, which comprise nanometer scale waviness detrimental to the desired smoothness of the FQA of the surface <b>1</b> on which IC devices are manufactured. The MRF operation in place of the intermediate polishing operation does not introduce nanometer scale defects in the surface <b>1</b> in the form of waviness, and, instead, smoothes the surface <b>1</b> by minimizing nanometer scale waviness. Further, the MRF operation in place of the intermediate polishing operation substantially eliminates roll off <b>3</b>, and improves the site flatness of the surface <b>1</b>. By substantially eliminating the roll off <b>3</b>, the FQA is maximized to increase the number of IC devices that can be manufactured on the surface <b>1</b>. The MRF operation increases the FQA of the surface <b>1</b> substantially to as near the perimeter surface <b>4</b> of the wafer <b>2</b> as can be measured by existing metrology, for example, by capacitance gauge metrology. Improving the site flatness, as measured by standard site flatness metrology, reduces the occurrence of nonplanar or rough surface areas, thus improving the yield of IC devices. As a further benefit, the MRF operation leaves a surface texture of nanometer scale height variations that tailors the surface <b>1</b> for removal of the surface texture to a smooth finish by a final polishing operation. </div>

The polishing plate is typically made of a ceramic or metal material. In accordance with the invention, an MRF system is programmed to shape the carrier plate to match the desired substrate shape. This technique can be used with wax or free-mount (template assembly) fixturing. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0034" num="0034">In accordance with a still further embodiment of the invention, an MRF system is used to polish large glass sample materials, such as blank lithographic masks, and in particular lithographic masks used in ultra-violet (UV) lithography, to extremely flat tolerances. Reflective masks, such as those used for enhanced extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) lithography must meet a much higher standard of flatness than conventional transmissive masks. In a preferred embodiment, a blank glass mask is polished to a TIR measurement, i.e. a peak to valley flatness of no more than about 0.050 μm. In comparison, conventional grinding, shaping, and polishing systems will not meet this standard, which typically provides about a TIR measurement of flatness on the order of about 500 nm. In accordance with the invention, using an MRF system, a blank glass mask can be prepared having a satisfactory Angstrom scale surface roughness. An additional benefit of glass mask processing using an MRF system is that the surface can remain free of polishing induced defects, which will result in fewer defects in subsequent coatings applied to the mask. <span style="display: none">[0034] </span> </div>
