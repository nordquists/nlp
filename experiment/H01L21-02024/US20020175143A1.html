</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">Semiconductor wafers, such as silicon wafers, are used for fabricating integrated circuits. Before integrated circuits can be made, wafers must be produced. Wafer production is a multi-part process. First, a semiconductor ingot is grown, often by the Czochralski method of pulling crystal, and shaped. The ingot is then sliced into wafers and prepared, through multiple steps, for polishing, in a process often referred to as the chemical wafer, or “CW,” process. The wafer is then polished and inspected in the polished wafer, or “PW,” process. Depending on end-use, the polished wafers are optionally subjected to a process by which an epitaxial layer is deposited on the wafer in the epitaxy, or “Epi,” process. <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005">In the crystal growing process, the semiconductor material, such as crystalline silicon, is grown to create an ingot. The ingot is subsequently ground to an accurate diameter, and then alignment flats or notches are ground into the ingot. In the next phase of wafer fabrication, the ingot is sliced to create wafers. Subsequent to slicing, the wafers are subjected to edge-grinding. Edge grinding creates wafers with beveled edges and a final diameter. Edge grinding reduces the incidence of chipping. Chipping is undesirable because it produces particulates, and because a chip on a wafer is a propagation site for fractures that can occur as the wafer is subjected to stress from temperature changes and film depositions during the remainder of the fabrication process. Fracture damage in a single wafer can substantially reduce the overall yield of semiconductor wafers. The wafers are subjected to a lapping process to flatten and remove slicing damage incurred during the preceding step, then laser marked. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006">After lapping and laser marking, the wafers are subjected to a post-lap clean, and then an alkali clean. Following alkali cleaning, wafers are subjected to chemical etching, which removes damage and creates a smooth finish. After acid etching, wafers may be gettered externally, edge polished and/or annealed. Depending on the incidence of external gettering, the wafers are edge polished, or subjected to an annealing process. Wafers are annealed to stabilize resistivity. <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007">Chemical etching conducted during the chemical wafer process typically leaves a rough surface on the edge of the wafers. Production of silicon wafers for use as semiconductor chips requires that wafers be ground to an exact diameter, and that the outer edge of the wafers be defect free down to a microscopic level. For this reason, the wafers are edge polished during the chemical wafer process. Edge polishing is conducted using standard polishing slurry solutions to smooth out the roughened edge resulting from etching and to further reduce stress caused by edge grinding to the precise diameters required. Edge polishing results in a mirror like surface that resists adhesion of contaminating particulates, and prevents fracture. <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0008" num="0008">The standard polishing solutions used in edge polishing are aqueous, alkaline colloidal silica-containing slurries. Although the polishing process is directed to the edge alone, occasionally alkaline slurry can splash on the back and/or front surfaces of the silicon wafers. These splashes cause unwanted etching on the surface(s) of the wafers. This undesirable etching effect becomes increasingly noticeable over time as the evaporation of water increases the concentration of caustic in the slurry. When the resulting etching is visible under fluorescent or halogen light, the wafer is rejected as unacceptable product due to “edge stain,” which is a micro-defect on the edge of the surface of the wafer that appears as microscopic pitting or other etch phenomena. <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0009" num="0009">There are known methods to reduce the occurrence of edge stain. One method includes the chemical cleaning of silicon wafers referred to as “SC-1 cleaning.” SC-1 cleaning is known to be effective in preventing edge-stain. SC-1 cleaning solution is comprised of ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and water. However, SC-1 cleaning has its disadvantages. SC-1 solution is expensive. In addition, including SC-1 cleaning in the process of manufacturing semiconductor chips requires the addition of steps for chemical and waste water treatment. Thus, SC-1 cleaning increases the complexity and the cost of semiconductor chip manufacture. <span style="display: none">[0009] </span> </div>

In light of this knowledge, more dense dielectric films, such as silicon nitride, are often used in combination with the oxide to passivate the wafers against such impurities. <i>Ibid</i>., p. 72.

In the method, acid-etched wafers are dipped in water charged with ozone to create a silicon oxide passivation layer. This passivation layer protects the surface of the wafer during the process of edge polishing. The use of ozonated water to prevent edge stain is a less elaborate technique than SC-1 cleaning, in that special steps for chemical and waste water clean up are not required. In spite of this improvement, the creation of an ozonated water bath can be sufficiently expensive that use of the Nakano process is not fully satisfactory in the production of semiconductor wafers. <span style="display: none">[0011] </span> </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0015" num="0015">This invention provides processes for polishing wafers that satisfy the above needs. More particularly, embodiments of the processes for polishing wafers protect wafer surfaces not subjected to polishing (i.e. the wafer backside) from the effects of polishing slurry. The processes can protect semiconductor materials subject to polishing by creating a passivation layer. The processes can effectively and inexpensively prevent the occurrence of edge stain on semiconductor materials. In addition, embodiments of the processes can provide a wafer surface suitable for integrated circuit fabrication. <span style="display: none">[0015] </span> </div>

The surfaces of the wafers that are not subsequently polished are not damaged during the polishing of the wafers. Embodiments of the processes comprise contacting wafers with an aqueous solution comprising hydrogen peroxide to form oxide layers. The aqueous solution does not contain ammonium hydroxide, which would be the case with an SC-1 solution. The wafers having oxide layers are then polished with an aqueous alkaline slurry without subjecting the wafers to pre-polish cleaning. <span style="display: none">[0016] </span> </div>

In embodiments of the processes of this invention, edge staining of wafers is prevented by contacting wafers with hydrogen peroxide prior to polishing the wafers. The processes can be employed whenever acid-etched silicon wafers are polished with an alkaline slurry, and the unpolished surfaces of the wafers need to be protected from detrimental effects of the slurry. The processes are particularly advantageous following acid-etching and following high-temperature annealing in the chemical wafer process. <span style="display: none">[0017] </span> </div>

The silicon oxide layer forms by the reaction of the hydrogen peroxide solution with the suspending or binding compounds of the wafer. The wafer, having a silicon oxide layer on its surface, is then polished. Slurry that contacts the unpolished backside of the wafer does not cause unwanted pitting, stain, or other unwanted slurry-related phenomena, because the backside is protected by the oxide layer. The oxide layer is removed at a later stage in the process of wafer manufacture. <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> </div>
