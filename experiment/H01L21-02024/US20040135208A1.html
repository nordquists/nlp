Boron and d-electron-based heavy metal atoms (for example, iron) have a function of forming a compound (iron and boron pairs) in silicon. The boron in silicon has, through the above function, an effect of sacking and capturing d-electron-based heavy metal contamination atoms, that is, a gettering effect (called boron gettering). This enables removal of heavy metal atoms, which are the most harmful to a device, from the active region of a semiconductor element, so as to improve the yield. A p<sup>+</sup> substrate having boron at a high concentration and the p/p<sup>+</sup> have great gettering abilities to d-electron-based heavy metal contamination atoms. </div>

This SFQR is a most frequently used parameter to indicate the flatness of a wafer, and is defined as an amplitude of a projection or depression on the front face of the wafer from a minimum square plane which is mathematically obtained in a region (typically a slit size of a scanning stepper: 25×8 (mm<span style="display: none">[0007] </span> <sup>2</sup>)) on the front face of the wafer. The required value is semiempirically obtained from the performance of lithography required for microfabrication for 70 (nm) and, without meeting this value, it is impossible to manufacture a fine pattern (a gate electrode of the transistor in particular) in a desired size. It is widely recognized that a wafer without an SFQR value equal to a minimum fabrication line width generally causes defocus in the lithography process to bring about a pattern formation failure, and based on this recognition, ITRS requires wafer flatness. </div>

As shown in FIG. 18, however, in development of 70 (nm)-generation semiconductor integrated circuits, only 40% of SSP wafers formed by conventional manufacturing methods meet SFQR values ≦70 (nm), which leads to a problem in which the SFQR values ≦70 (nm) cannot be fully achieved. In other words, it is impossible to manufacture devices conforming to the 70 (nm) rule at a high yield as long as using wafers produced by the prior art. </div>

On the other hand, since the alkali etching is a surface reaction controlled process, the non-uniformity of flow of an etching solution has less effect, but the etching speed varies depending on anisotropy, that is, crystal orientation of silicon, so that projections and depressions are apt to appear on the front face due to anisotropy This cycle of the projections and depressions, however, is equal to or lower than one-several tenths of that due to the acid etching, and therefore the alkali etching or the alkali etching+the acid etching is mainly used in these days. <span style="display: none">[0015] </span> </div>

Accordingly, the front face becomes certainly flat after the polishing, but the flatness is kept only in the state of the rear face being adhered (or sacked) to the plate. When the wafer is detached from the plate, the projections and depressions on the rear face remain as they are even after completion of the polishing, so that part of them are transferred or printed through to the front face.

It is known that since the DSP wafer, however, has a contact area with an electrostatic chuck during dry etching much larger than that of the SSP wafer, a contact hole formed in the DSP wafer will greatly differ in diameter from that in the SSP wafer. It is also known that a de-chucking sequence from the electrostatic chuck for the DSP wafer is greatly different from that for the SSP wafer, and that the DSP wafer slips in a carrier system for the SSP wafer. these facts show that the use of the SSP wafer and the DSP wafer in the same device manufacturing line is difficult or leads to increased cost. <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> </div>

In this case, the problem arising from formation of no LTO film is autodoping during formation of an epitaxial film. They eliminated the necessity of a measure against the autodoping by decreasing the concentration of boron in a p<sup>+</sup> substrate from 1×10<sup>19 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) in the prior art down to a range of not lower than 2.5×10<sup>18 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) nor higher than 8×10<sup>18 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). It is known that boron gettering never acts on elements other than d-electron-based ones (for example, molybdenum), and that gettering by oxygen precipitate is effective. Tamatsuka at al. also devised doping of impurity nitrogen during growth of the p<sup>+</sup> substrate (crystal) in order to promote the formation of the oxygen precipitate and add oxygen precipitation gettering. </div>

The autodoping means that boron in a p<sup>+</sup> substrate sputters from the rear face thereof and adheres to the front face of an adjacent water in a heating process for producing semiconductor integrated circuits to change the resistivity (boron concentration) of a region thereof where devices are to be produced. This brings about a situation of the devices not normally operating. Binns et al. show that whether or not autodoping occurs in the heating process depends on the kind of an atmospheric gas source in heating. When heat treatment is performed in an oxygen atmosphere, an oxide film is formed on the front face of the wafer. This oxide film has a function of preventing autodoping. On the other hand, when the heat treatment was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere, the occurrence of autodoping was found. The heating process for producing semiconductor integrated circuits is performed in various atmospheres and, therefore, it is desired to develop a wafer capable of avoiding the autodoping irrespective of an oxidizing or non-oxidizing atmospheric gas source. </div>

The reduction in the concentration of boron, however, may cause poor gettering ability by boron, leading to a malfunction of a semiconductor integrated circuit. The gettering ability of p/p<sup>+</sup> is much higher than that at a reference level leading to a malfunction of the semiconductor integrated circuit. Accordingly. the reduction in the concentration of boron becomes possible by permitting a reduction in the gettering ability down to such a reference level. Hence, the present inventors decided to find an optimal boron concentration by reducing the concentration of boron in a p<sup>+</sup> substrate (silicon wafer) to limit, quantitatively accurately, an optimal appropriate range of the boron concentration meeting two conflicting challenges of {circle over (1)} avoidance of autodoping of boron in a heating process and {circle over (2)} securement of a gettering ability enabling normal operation of a semiconductor integrated circuit, so as to meet the future requirement for SFQR values ≦70 (nm). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0059]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0059" num="0059">It is also known that boron becomes an oxygen precipitation nucleus (see, for example, Japan se Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-50715 by Inaba et al.), and therefore the reduction in the concentration of boron leads to a reduction in nuclear density to cause insufficient oxygen precipitation and thus insufficient oxygen precipitation gettering. The present inventors observed, using an infrared absorption method, the effect of impurity carbon on the formation of oxygen precipitation nucleus (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-204534). It was found that the oxygen precipitation nucleus in a CZ silicon crystal doped with the impurity carbon is a compound of carbon and oxygen. Hence, the present inventors devised application of carbon doping to a silicon substrate to be used for producing an epitaxial wafer in order to promote the formation of an oxygen precipitate which will be a gettering source of contamination metal other than d-electron-based ones (for example, molybdenum), in addition to the boron gettering. It is known (in the same document) that the effect of promoting the oxygen precipitation by carbon is hardly lost even if the heat treatment temperature in the device process is decreased to 800° C. or lower, and therefore there is no problem in application of the carbon doping to future processes. <span style="display: none">[0059] </span> </div>

There is an already developed epitaxial wafer (called a p/p<span style="display: none">[0060] </span> <sup>−</sup> in relation to a p/p<sup>+</sup>) having a substrate boron concentration which has been reduced from 1×10<sup>19 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) of the p<sup>+</sup> down to 1×10<sup>15 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). Because of the low boron concentration, the p/p<sup>−</sup> causes no autodoping and thus has no LTO film on the rear face. The p/p<sup>−</sup> cannot be expected at all to provide boron gettering that the p/p<sup>+</sup> has. Hence, a technology has been developed that dopes a p<sup>−</sup> substrate with nitrogen or carbon to promote oxygen precipitation so as to add an oxygen precipitation gettering ability thereto. The main point of the present invention is to achieve both avoidance of autodoping and securement of a gettering ability by optimizing the boron concentration, and further to enhance them by carbon doping. As for specifications of a wafer, the substrate boron concentration of an epitaxial wafer devised in the present invention is defined to fall within an intermediate region between those of the p/p<sup>+</sup> and the p/p<sup>−</sup>. </div>

Each sample employed for the experiment is one produced by dividing a substrate having a diameter of 200 (mm) into four pieces. With consideration of this, it is necessary to reduce the boron concentration of Sample B to a quarter for the avoidance of autodoping.
