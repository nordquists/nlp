The presence of such surface unevenness can be confirmed by an evaluation where a wafer surface is divided with a specific area, for example, an area 0.5 mm square, a P-V value in each area is confirmed and it is evaluated to what extent the wafer surface is occupied with a specific P-V value. In the prior art polishing step, for example, when the above evaluation is performed in an area 0.5 mm square, there was present even a wafer with a P-V value of the order of 20 nm. In company with a progressive request for a wafer with good flatness, however, even the presence of a P-V value of the order of 20 nm is a problem; there is requested improvement on the above problems. <span style="display: none">[0013] </span> </div>

A difference in hardness between the polishing cloths in the first polishing and the corrective polishing is only such that the latter is harder than the former without no other specific limitation, and the latter is effectively harder than the former by 10 to 40% in hardness. To explain more concretely, since hardness of the polishing cloth used in the first polishing step <b>18</b> <i>a </i>is usually in the range of from 73 to 86 in Asker-C scale and in a compression ratio range of from 2 to 5%, hardness of the polishing cloth in the corrective polishing step <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is preferably in the range of from 80 to 98 in Asker-C scale and in a compression ration of from 0.5% to 2%. At this time, an amount of polishing stock removal in the corrective polishing may be determined fittingly according to a state of surface unevenness after the first polishing. However, an amount of polishing stock removal in the corrective polishing is to be set in the range of the order of from 0.3 to 3 μm, almost independently of an amount of polishing stock removal in the first polishing. This is because a P-V value of surface unevenness having a wavelength of 0.5 μm or more is of the order of hundreds of nm; therefore polishing of stock removal of 0.3 μm or more is sufficient to approximately correct the surface unevenness. Although increase in an amount of polishing stock removal leads to further improvement of the surface unevenness, use of a polishing cloth of relatively high hardness in the present corrective polishing leads to the fact that a polishing cloth is apt to be loaded, whereby there is a tendency to reduce a life time of the polishing cloth. Therefore, an amount of polishing stock removal is preferably restricted to the order of 3 μm. If polishing is more preferably performed in the range of from 0.5 to 2 μm in an amount of polishing stock removal, surface unevenness having a relatively long wavelength and a large P-V value remaining after the first polishing can be perfectly removed, with the result that a lifetime of the polishing cloth is preferably improved. </div>
