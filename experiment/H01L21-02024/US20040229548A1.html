According to an embodiment of double-side polishing which is described in EP208315B1, semiconductor wafers in carrier plates made from metal or plastic which have suitably dimensioned cutouts are moved between two rotating polishing plates covered with a polishing cloth, in the presence of a polishing fluid, on a path which is predetermined by the machine and process parameters and are thereby polished (in the specialist literature, carrier plates are also referred to as templates). <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> </div>

Materials of this type, the further processing of which is predominantly in the semiconductor industry, but is not restricted to this particular application, include, for example, silicon, silicon-germanium, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, gallium arsenide and further III-V semiconductors. Silicon in single crystal form, for example crystallized by a Czochralski pulling process or a float zone pulling process, is preferred. Silicon with a (<span style="display: none">[0017] </span> <b>100</b>), (<b>110</b>) or (<b>111</b>) crystal orientation is particularly preferred. </div>

The semiconductor wafers can either be used directly as starting material for the fabrication of semiconductor components or, after a final polishing step has been carried out in accordance with the prior art and/or after layers, such as back surface sealing layers or an epitaxial coating of the wafer front surface with silicon or other suitable semiconductor materials, have been applied and/or after conditioning by means of a heat treatment, can be fed to their intended use. <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> </div>

However, it is preferable for the sharply defined and therefore mechanically highly sensitive wafer edge to be rounded with the aid of a suitably profiled grinding disc prior to the double-side polishing. Furthermore, to improve the geometry and partially remove the damaged crystal layers, it is possible for the silicon wafer to be subjected to a mechanical abrasion step, such as lapping or grinding, in order to reduce the amount of material removed in the polishing step according to the invention. An etching step may follow at this point in order to remove the areas of the crystal at the wafer surface and edge which have inevitably been damaged in the mechanical process steps and to remove any impurities which may be present, for example metallic impurities which are bound up in the damage. This etching step may be carried out either as a wet-chemical treatment of the silicon wafer in an alkaline or acidic etching mixture, or as a plasma treatment. <span style="display: none">[0020] </span> </div>

The polishing machine substantially comprises a lower polishing plate, which can rotate freely in the horizontal plane, and an upper polishing plate, which can rotate freely in the horizontal plane, both of these plates being covered with a polishing cloth, and allows material-removing polishing of both sides of semiconductor wafers, in this case silicon wafers, when a polishing fluid of a suitable chemical composition is supplied continuously. <span style="display: none">[0021] </span> </div>

The silicon wafers are held on a geometric path which is defined by machine and process parameters during polishing by carrier plates which have cutouts of sufficient size to hold the silicon wafers. The carrier plates are in contact with the polishing machine by means for example of a pin gearing or an involute gearing via a rotating inner pin or toothed ring and a generally opposite rotating outer pin or toothed ring, and are thereby set in rotary motion between the two polishing plates. <span style="display: none">[0022] </span> </div>

If there is in each case one silicon wafer in the center of a carrier plate, the silicon wafer moves in a circle around the center of the polishing machine. If a plurality of silicon wafers are positioned eccentrically in a carrier plate, rotation of the carrier plates about their own axis results in a hypocycloidal path. A hypocycloidal path is preferred for the polishing process according to the invention.

Furthermore, the material must be suitable for the production of highly planar, stress-free and undulation-free carrier plates of the desired thickness and geometry.

To prevent damage to the edge of the wafer from the inner edge of the cutout in the carrier plate during polishing, it is expedient and therefore preferred for the inner side of the cutout to be provided with a plastic lining of the same thickness as the carrier plate, as proposed in EP208315B1. <span style="display: none">[0025] </span> </div>
