Currently, power devices that employ silicon substrates are used. However, due to the material characteristics of silicon, there is a limit to a further increase in performance of power devices by subjecting silicon to fine processing. In particular, silicon cannot be used under such conditions as high temperatures, so that there is a need for a material to replace silicon. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005"> An example of a material to replace silicon is SiC (silicon carbide). The width of the forbidden band of SiC is three times wider than the width of the forbidden band of silicon, so that SiC can be used at a higher temperature than silicon. The dielectric strength of SiC is about ten times greater than that of silicon. Therefore, with SiC substrates, power devices can be made smaller than in the case where silicon substrates are used. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of SiC is about three times higher than that of silicon. That is, SiC also has the advantage that it is superior to silicon in heat dissipation and easier to cool than silicon. As described above, SiC has superior characteristics compared to silicon,and thus SiC substrates have received attention as semiconductor substrates for power devices to replace silicon substrates. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006"> However, SiC substrates that are used for power devices are required to have a small surface roughness. As an abrasive that is used to polish a plate-shaped SiC material to obtain a SiC substrate, diamond abrasive grains or a suspension (pH 10 to 15) that contains SiO<sub>2 </sub>(colloidal silica) is used (for example, see JP H7-288243 A). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007"> However, when diamond abrasive grains were used as an abrasive, polishing was performed at a high speed, but there was the problem of processing damage and cracks due to chipping. When a suspension (pH 10 to 15) containing SiO<sub>2 </sub>(colloidal silica) was used, the above-mentioned processing damage and cracks did not occur, but there was the problem that the suspension caused considerable damage to a polishing device and also placed a significant burden on the environment because the suspension is a strong alkali. Moreover, the surface roughness of the obtained SiC substrate was not sufficiently small, and thus there has been a demand for SiC substrates having an even smaller surface roughness (for example, the surface roughness is 0.5 nm or less). </div>

A plate-shaped SiC material <b>1</b> is fixed to a weight <b>5</b> and the SiC material <b>1</b> is pressed onto the pad <b>3</b> <i>a </i>by the load of the weight <b>5</b>. That is, the method for manufacturing a SiC substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> adopts a method of carrying out polishing using the load of a weight, for example. The SiC material <b>1</b> is disk-shaped, for example. The weight <b>5</b> is provided with a guide <b>4</b> for holding the SiC material <b>1</b> in a predetermined position so that the SiC material <b>1</b> does not deviate from the predetermined position. </div>

Also, when the rotary table <b>2</b> is rotated at a rotational velocity of 40 rpm and when the rotary table <b>2</b> has a diameter of 300 mm, for example, then the abrasive <b>6</b> is dripped at a rate of 0.005 ml or more in a period of 5 seconds at room temperature (about 23° C.).

The colloidal silica <b>6</b> <i>a </i>that has penetrated into the pores is fixed to the porous material by a hydration layer enclosing the colloidal silica <b>6</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, the colloidal silica <b>6</b> <i>a </i>that has been dripped onto the pad <b>3</b> <i>a </i>acts as if it were a fixed abrasive grain.

Another reason is that if the average particle size is too large, then it becomes difficult for colloidal silica <b>6</b> <i>a </i>to be fixed in the pores of the pad <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, and thus the precision of polishing is decreased (and the surface roughness of a SiC substrate is increased).

However, if the size of the weight <b>5</b> is increased, then the weight <b>5</b> loses its balance during rotation, so that it becomes impossible to process the SiC material <b>1</b> uniformly and smoothly using the weight <b>5</b>. For example, when a SiC material <b>1</b> having a diameter of 2 inches (about 50 mm) is pressed onto the polishing pad <b>3</b> using the weight <b>5</b> in the form of a cylinder, the diameter of the face of the weight <b>5</b> that is in contact with the SiC material <b>1</b> is set to <b>2</b> inches (about 50 mm), for example.

Consequently, the surface roughness increases in the face of the polished SiC material <b>1</b> (SiC substrate). However, if the pressure under which the SiC material <b>1</b> is pressed onto the polishing pad <b>3</b> is 44 kPa or less, then a SiC substrate having a small surface roughness of 0.5 nm or less, for example, can be obtained. </div>
