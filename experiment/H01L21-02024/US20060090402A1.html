However, in such types of polishing compositions, problems arise due to negative effects caused by flocculation of colloidal silica. For example, many surface defects are generated on a semiconductor substrate that has been polished with the polishing composition, and in case of recycling the polishing composition, a filter used for removing polishing chips in the polishing composition that has been used for polishing easily gets clogged. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications No. 4-313224 and No. 11-302634 disclose polishing compositions that are improved to avoid such negative effects. However, the polishing compositions of the above publications No. 4-313224 and No. 11-302634 do not sufficiently satisfy the required performance and there is yet room for improvements in the polishing compositions. </div>

Therefore, in view of improving the polishing rate, the average particle size of the secondary particles of colloidal silica is preferably 10 nm or more. Meanwhile, when the average particle size of the secondary particles of colloidal silica is greater than 60 nm, or more specifically greater than 40 nm, or even more specifically greater than 30 nm, clogging of a filter is likely to occur and the filter needs to be exchanged frequently. Therefore, in view of preventing clogging of the filter, the average particle size of the secondary particles of colloidal silica is preferably 60 nm or less, and more preferably 40 nm or less, and even more preferably 30 nm or less. The average particle size of the secondary particles of colloidal silica is obtained through, for example, a laser diffraction scattering method. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012"> When the content of colloidal silica in the polishing composition is less than 2% by mass, colloidal silica easily flocculates. As a result, many surface defects are generated on the polished object or the filter gets clogged in a short time. Therefore, in view of preventing flocculation of colloidal silica, the content of colloidal silica in the polishing composition must be 2% by mass or more. Meanwhile, when the content of colloidal silica in the polishing composition is greater than 50% by mass, there is a risk that the stability of the polishing composition could be decreased causing gelation of or deposition in the polishing composition. Therefore, in view of preventing gelation of and deposition in the polishing composition, the content of colloidal silica in the polishing composition is preferably 50% by mass or less. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013"> The flocculation of colloidal silica is caused when the secondary particles of colloidal silica are strongly pressed against one another due to pressure (polishing pressure) applied between a polishing member such as a polishing pad and the object while polishing. Therefore, including a relatively large amount of colloidal silica in the polishing composition is very effective in preventing flocculation of colloidal silica since the pressure applied to each secondary particle is decreased as a result of dispersion of the polishing pressure. </div>

Therefore, in view of improving the polishing rate, the total content of potassium hydroxide and potassium bicarbonate in the polishing composition is preferably 0.01% by mass or more, and more preferably 0.1% by mass or more. Meanwhile, when the total content of potassium hydroxide and potassium bicarbonate in the polishing composition is greater than 10% by mass, or more specifically 5% by mass, there is a risk that the cost effectiveness could become low and the polishing composition could become uneconomical.

As a result, there is a risk that the polishing composition could not have a high polishing ability. Therefore, in view of improving the polishing rate, the content of potassium hydroxide is preferably greater than or equal to the content of potassium bicarbonate. Meanwhile, when the content of potassium hydroxide in the polishing composition is greater than five times the content of potassium bicarbonate in the polishing composition, there is a risk that flocculation of colloidal silica could not be strongly suppressed since the content of potassium bicarbonate in the polishing composition is small.

Contrastingly, the evaluations for the stability of the secondary particle size of colloidal silica in comparative examples 1 to 12 were either poor or slightly poor. The results suggest that the polishing compositions of the present invention reliably suppress flocculation of colloidal silica. In examples 1 to 11, any of the evaluations for “Preventing degree of filter clogging” were either acceptable, good, or excellent. The results suggest that clogging of the filter is suppressed by setting the average particle size of the secondary particles of colloidal silica to 60 nm or less. </div>

This is because, for example, potassium hydroxide was added to the polishing compositions so as to maintain the pH of the polishing compositions at 10.5 while polishing. For example, if potassium hydroxide is removed from the composition of the polishing composition of example 3, the pH of the polishing composition will decrease while polishing. Thus, the polishing rate will not be sufficient for a practical level. </div>
