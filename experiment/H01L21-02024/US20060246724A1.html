Incidentally, while in order to generate no linear defect, there are especially important the shapes and diameters of the silica particles and the dispersion state thereof, problems associated with increase in a polishing rate and metal contamination are also to be solved for using them as the polishing agent. Though the problems are solved to some extent by using an additive such as TMAH, it is preferable to add materials having a chelating effect such as sodium tripolyphosphate or other chelating agents. In order to increase the polishing rate, organic amines, piperazine or others are arbitrarily added. It is preferable to use ion exchange resins and the like in the production stage of the silica particles to thereby remove heavy metals and others sufficiently. It is preferable that Cu and Ni concentrations in the polishing agent are controlled to 1 ppb or less. </div>

It is thought that a cause for generation of linear defects is mainly an influence of a polishing agent, and when using a polishing cloth of this type, liner defects are greatly generated in the primary polishing and the secondary polishing; therefore compatibility between the polishing agent and the polishing cloth may be one of causes for generation of the linear defects. With the polishing method of the present invention, even if the above polishing cloth is used, generation of the linear defects can be prevented. Incidentally, the term âAsker C hardnessâ is a value measured with a C type Asker rubber hardness meter that is one kind of a spring hardness tester and obtained according to SRIS (The Society of Rubber Industry, Japan standards) 0101. </div>
