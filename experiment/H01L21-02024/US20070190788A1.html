<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001"> 1. Field of the Invention </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to manufacturing of semiconductor materials and the portion related to chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). More specifically, the present invention provides for reduction of the wafer lift-off force on a CMP tool, and thereby diminishing the chances of wafer breakage. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> 2. Background Art </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004"> In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, one of many steps of manufacturing includes the planarization of the semiconductor wafers. This is typically done via chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) tools. A primary goal of the CMP tooling step is to essentially polish a surface of the wafer so as to render it both planar and smooth. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a typical CMP tool system <b>10</b> wherein a wafer <b>8</b> is held face down on a carrier <b>20</b> that rotates (about arrow <b>22</b>), and is pressed against a polishing pad <b>2</b> attached on a rotating disk <b>4</b>, or platen. Various liquids and/or slurries (e.g., colloidal silica) (not shown) are continuously fed to a platen/wafer interface <b>6</b> to aid in this polishing. Upon satisfactory completion of the polishing step, the polished wafer <b>8</b> is removed from the interface <b>6</b>, specifically, and from the CMP tool system <b>10</b>, in general, by applying a lift-off force F<sub>0</sub>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006"> A shortcoming in the current art is that, often, upon lift off of wafer <b>8</b> from pad <b>2</b> and platen <b>4</b> breakage of wafer <b>8</b> occurs. Breakage occurs because the mechanical lift-off force (i.e., F<sub>0</sub>) necessary can at times exceed the fracture strength of wafer <b>8</b>. The lift-off force F<sub>0 </sub>is high for various reasons, including the flatness and smoothness of both the polished wafer <b>8</b> and polishing pad <b>2</b>. Necessary lift-off force F<sub>0 </sub>may be increased further by drag due to rinsing water (not shown) on polishing pad <b>2</b>. Surface tension at interface <b>6</b> and atmospheric pressure further effects necessary lift-off force F<sub>0</sub>, as well. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> CMP tools that include fixed abrasive polishing pads <b>2</b> are particularly prone to wafer <b>8</b> breakage because the smooth texture of polishing pads <b>2</b> causes very high requisite lift-off forces F<sub>0</sub>. Currently, spinning, sweeping, or blowing water off polishing pad <b>2</b> just prior to lift-off is used in an attempt to make wafer <b>8</b> lift-off more benign and successful. While effective at allowing successful lift-off of wafer <b>8</b>, these methods increase the likelihood of scratching wafer <b>8</b>, which is undesirable. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008"> In view of the foregoing, there exists a need for an improvement in CMP technique that reduces wafer removal breakage. </div>

A pad <b>12</b> resides on a platen <b>14</b>. Held in a face down configuration, a wafer <b>18</b> is rotated against pad <b>12</b> so as to polish wafer <b>18</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020"> Upon completion of polishing wafer <b>18</b> but prior to liftoff of wafer <b>18</b> from pad <b>12</b> and platen <b>14</b>, carbonated water <b>25</b> is applied at interface <b>16</b> between wafer <b>18</b> and platen <b>14</b> (and pad <b>12</b>). Carbonated water <b>25</b> may be applied, for example, via an applicator(s) <b>30</b> (e.g., nozzle) in fluid communication with a reservoir <b>31</b> and pump <b>32</b>.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021"> In one embodiment, carbonated water <b>25</b> may be deionized carbonated water <b>25</b> and may be pressurized so as to be at a higher pressure than the pressure that is ambient. Similarly, carbonated water <b>25</b> may be colder than ambient temperature, and may be chilled prior to application, for example, to a temperature in the range of approximately 40-50Â° Fahrenheit. For example, relative motion of pad <b>12</b> and wafer <b>18</b>, prior to application of carbonated water <b>25</b>, may cause a warming of a temperature in area of interface <b>16</b>. As the close-up view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts, carbonated water <b>25</b> has been placed at interface <b>16</b> between wafer <b>18</b> and pad <b>12</b> (and platen <b>14</b>). </div>

As bubbles <b>26</b> of carbon dioxide gas form and as the temperature of carbonated water <b>25</b> increases, due to ambient temperature being warmer than carbonated water <b>25</b>, bubbles <b>26</b> increase in size. Force F<sub>B </sub>is exerted against surface <b>13</b> of pad <b>12</b> and surface <b>19</b> of wafer <b>18</b>, thereby decreasing the necessary lift-off force F<sub>1 </sub>that is ultimately required to subsequently lift wafer <b>18</b> from pad <b>12</b> and platen <b>14</b>. The carbon dioxide gas formed between wafer <b>18</b> and platen <b>14</b> reduces the force on wafer <b>18</b> by reducing the atmospheric effect due to partial vacuum that is created during lift-off. Thus, ultimately lift-off force F<sub>1 </sub>required is less than F<sub>0 </sub>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) (i.e., without using carbonated water <b>25</b>) so that wafer <b>18</b> breakage is less likely to occur. A removal mechanism <b>40</b> in communication with wafer <b>18</b> is used to remove wafer <b>18</b> from platen <b>14</b> by exerting requisite force to wafer <b>18</b>.
