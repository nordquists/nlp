The delicate nature of this advanced process has been shown to remove irregularities, commonly referred to as a surface crosshatch pattern associated with the metamorphic GBL, without the introduction of subsurface damage validated by high resolution x-ray diffraction. This low damage, coupled with minimal introduction of surface contamination associated with the planarization process, allows a graded buffer layer (GBL) approach to be realized on semi-insulating substrates, suitable for the development of advanced device technologies implemented on metamorphic buffer layer templates containing surface crosshatch patterns, to achieve state of the art circuit performance and functionality. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012"> In known semiconductor manufacturing processes, wafer-scale manufacturing is generally used, in which multiple copies of a desired circuit or device are fabricated on a relatively large silicon wafer, with individual circuits or devices trimmed from the wafer upon process completion. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a silicon ingot <b>104</b>, which is typically formed by immersing a seed crystal in molten silicon. The ingot <b>104</b> is slowly withdrawn from the molten silicon, using suspension rod <b>102</b>, as crystal growth proceeds. Since crystal growth tends to be uniform in all directions, the ingot <b>104</b> is substantially cylindrical. After the ingot <b>104</b> is completely withdrawn from the molten silicon, it is generally ground to a uniform circular cross-section, and individual silicon wafers <b>106</b> are sliced from the ingot <b>104</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013"> Even in conventional semiconductor fabrication, in which large geometry CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) devices, for example, may be formed, it is important that the silicon on which the devices are fabricated be relatively free of impurities and defects in the crystal structure. To ensure this condition, a layer of silicon <b>202</b> is grown on the surface of the wafer <b>106</b> via an epitaxial growth process, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014"> In epitaxial growth, exposed silicon on the wafer surface is used as a seed for additional silicon crystal growth. Typically, the wafer <b>106</b> is exposed to silane (and perhaps dopant gases) at high temperatures. Dopant gases are used to form doped epitaxial regions, such as lightly or heavily doped n-type or p-type epitaxial regions, that may be required depending upon the types of devices or circuits being fabricated. Buried layers may also be created, using diffusion or ion-implantation processes, for example, prior to epitaxial growth. An epitaxially grown layer is often referred to as “epi.”</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015"> In modern processes designed for fabrication of higher performance devices, a combination of In<sub>0.52</sub>Al<sub>0.48</sub>As/In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.48</sub>As/In<sub>0.52</sub>Al<sub>0.48</sub>As epilayers grown on semi-insulating InP substrates may be utilized due to the attractive electron transport properties of the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As base layer. It is well known that increasing the indium composition in the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As layer leads to a reduction in electron effective mass and an associated increase in electron mobility. In addition to improving the transistor transport properties, the higher indium composition in the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As layer leads to a reduction in transistor turn-on voltage. Therefore, increasing the indium composition in the In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As layer of the transistors allows for state of the art device performance at ultra low powers over conventional transistors with lattice matched In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As layers. </div>

The metamorphic graded composition buffer layer (GBL) is implemented to accomplish the lattice parameter grade. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a wafer structure based upon an InP substrate <b>302</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017"> Molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth is used to deposit the GBL through direct deposition of atomic (or polyatomic molecular) species at a substrate surface. The species being deposited are generally contained within effusion cells having controllable apertures and cell temperatures. The growth rate for an epitaxial layer deposited in this fashion is generally determined by effusion cell temperature and substrate temperature, while the ratio of atom types deposited to form a specific epitaxial layer is controlled through manipulating each effusion cell's shutter aperture. This MBE process should not be confused with MOCVD (Molecular Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition). With MOCVD, the required atoms are introduced to the substrate via volatile molecular organometallic species (carriers). </div>

These dislocation types often cause an unacceptable crosshatch pattern on the outer surface of MBE-produced layers that can propagate through outer device layers <b>306</b> and cause surface undulations <b>308</b>. The process described herein is directed toward an MBE-compatible chemical mechanical polishing process (CMP) for thin (less than a micron thick) mixed Cation-Anion Group III-V based semiconductor epilayers with high indium content toward that of InAs. Of course, the process is also suitable for other layer thicknesses and compositions as well. The process introduces no measurable subsurface damage by x-ray diffraction, which enables the realization of a graded buffer layer approach suitable for the development of advanced device technologies to achieve state of the art circuit performance and functionality. </div>

A surfactant is added to the Sodium Hypochlorite solution, and the temperature of the solution is allowed to stabilize at approximately room temperature.
