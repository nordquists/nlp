<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0002">In recent years, semiconductor devices and hard disks have become markedly smaller, have acquired increased capacity, and have undergone other remarkable increases in functionality. For this reason, hard disk substrates and silicon wafers, which are semiconductor device substrates, are required to have extremely flat, damage-free surfaces, and distortion-free mirror polishing and planarization have been widely employed. So-called mechanical-chemical polishing (CMP) is used to perform such surface treatments. This method involves the use of a nonwoven fabric having a unique structure (polishing pad) and a polishing liquid (slurry) obtained by suspending silica particles in an alkaline solution having a pH of around 10.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0003">A general outline of such a polishing device is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Polishing is performed while a slurry <b>13</b> (the slurry feed part is not shown) is continuously fed to an interface between a polishing pad <b>11</b> and a wafer <b>12</b>.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0004">Silica particles readily aggregate in aqueous solutions, and are therefore usually kept in an alkaline solution. Silica particles are also used as an abrasive while kept dispersed in an alkali aqueous solution. For example, 3900RS (trade name; manufactured by Kabushiki Kaisha Fujimi Corporation), ILD-1300 (trade name; manufactured by Rodel Nitta Kabushiki Kaisha), and other polishing liquids are microparticulate silica alkaline polishing liquids obtained by adding silica particles to an ammonia solution. Another example of a polishing liquid obtained by suspending silica particles in an alkaline solution is disclosed in Patent Document 1.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0005">Various types of silica particles that differ in manufacturing method and shape are used as abrasives. However, in terms of machining the substrate material to an extremely flat, damage-free surface, colloidal silica produced from alkoxysilane is significantly better than materials such as colloidal silica for which fumed silica and aqueous glass are used as starting materials. However, colloidal silica has a drawback in that the polishing rate is low.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0006">When an abrasive has a low polishing rate, the scope of application thereof is limited to the touch polishing used to remove scratches during the final polishing of a silicon wafer, and to the use as an auxiliary material in some operations involved in the polishing of metal films on semiconductor substrates. Due to such circumstances, improvements in the polishing rate of silica particles are strongly needed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0007">Polishing liquids in which silica particles are added as an abrasive are typically used in an alkaline state. The reason that the alkaline state is maintained is that a higher polishing rate can be obtained. By adding ammonia to the polishing liquid and examining the polishing rate of a silicon wafer, it can be confirmed that the higher the alkalinity, the higher the polishing rate. This is one means for improving the polishing rate of the silica particles, and it is employed to alkalize commercial polishing liquids as well. However, because silica particles tend to be readily dissolved in alkaline aqueous solutions having a pH of 9 or higher, an actual polishing liquid cannot be made to have an unreasonably high pH. In addition, when the alkalinity is high, disposal of spent polishing liquid becomes problematic. In view of these factors, the inventors arrived at the present invention as a result of extensive research on methods for improving polishing rate without the addition of a large amount of alkalis.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0016">The polishing composition of the present invention is readily obtained by mixing silica particles, water, a basic material, and an inorganic salt. However, the present invention is also readily produced by adding an inorganic salt to a pre-prepared polishing composition comprising silica particles, water, and a basic material. Therefore, the polishing composition of the present invention can also be produced by adding an inorganic salt to a commercially available polishing composition that includes silica particles, water, and a basic material. This method for producing a polishing composition makes it possible: to eliminate instability arising from aggregation of the silica particles within the composition, changes in the particle diameters, and variation in the polishing rate; and to retain stability for an extended period of time. In addition, the polishing composition of the present invention comprises silica particles, water, a basic material, and an inorganic salt, but may also include other wetting agents or other materials usually included in polishing compositions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0017">A comparison made between a conventionally known polishing composition that comprises silica particles, water, and a basic material and the present invention, which is obtained by adding an inorganic salt to such a polishing composition, reveals that the polishing composition of the present invention exhibits a markedly higher polishing rate. An even higher polishing rate is exhibited when silica particles do not aggregate after the inorganic salt has been added to a polishing composition comprising silica particles, water, and a basic material. This is because aggregation of the silica particles entails a decrease in the polishing rate. The “aggregation of particles” hereunder refers to the massing together or clumping of the silica particles so that the diameters of the particles increase, and it is observed as the formation of precipitates, cloudiness in the solution, and the like. This phenomenon occurs, e.g., when an excessively large amount of inorganic salt is added. Aggregation also occurs when a small amount of an alkaline-earth metal salt is added.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0018">Silica particles produced through any manufacturing method and of any shape may be used in the polishing composition of the present invention. However, colloidal silica is preferable to fumed silica. This is due to that fumed silica is synthesized in high-temperature flames, and therefore the particles of fumed silica often melt together so that the surface is no longer smooth. Accordingly, a material that is molten at a high temperature may be used, provided the surface thereof is smooth. Examples of preferred silica particles include spherical silica obtained by re-melting fumed silica and then forming large particles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0019">There are no particular restrictions on the particle diameter of the silica particles used in the polishing composition of the present invention, but the diameter is preferably between 5 and 500 nm, and are more preferably between 20 and 200 nm. If the particle diameter of the silica is too small, the silica will become embedded in the fine unevenness of the pad during polishing, preventing polishing performance from being exhibited. On the other hand, if the particle diameter is too large, the silica particles within the polishing composition will readily precipitate and not be able to reach the polishing interface between the wafer and the polishing pad.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0020">The polishing composition of the present invention includes a basic material and is therefore alkaline. This alkalinity is preferably in a pH range of 7.5 to 12.0. The pH is more preferably in a range of from 8.0 to 10.5. If the pH is in a range of from 8.0 to 10.5, the addition of an inorganic salt yields a dramatic improvement in the polishing rate. In the region below a pH of 7.5, the slurry is less stable. In the region above a pH of 12.0, the silica particles dissolve and the particle diameter decreases. The reason that the polishing composition of the present invention comprises a basic material is that a polishing composition that comprises silica particles, water, and a basic material is easy to store, and that the polishing composition of the present invention can be readily produced when an inorganic salt is added to such a polishing composition. There are no particular restrictions to the basic materials that can be used in the present invention, but chemical compounds that do not cause the silica particles to aggregate are preferred. Examples of such basic materials include: alkali metal hydroxides such as NaOH, KOH; and NH<sub>4</sub>OH (aqueous ammonia). Amines such as tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) can also be used. KOH or NH<sub>4</sub>OH (aqueous ammonia) are preferable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0021">The amount of silica particles included in the polishing composition of the present invention is preferably 0.1 to 5.0%, and more preferably 0.2 to 1.0%, based on the weight of the entire polishing material. If the amount of silica particles is too high, the particles will readily aggregate and cause the polishing rate to decrease. Examples of the inorganic salts of the present invention include alkali metal salts and ammonium salts such as KCl, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, KNO<sub>3</sub>, NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and one or more can be selected from among these examples.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0022">The polishing composition preferably has a higher inorganic salt content because a larger amount leads to a better polishing rate. However, if the inorganic salt content is too high, the silica particles will readily aggregate, causing the polishing rate to decrease. The inorganic salt content is preferably within a range of 1.0 mol or less per one liter of polishing composition. The inorganic salt content is more preferably within a range of 0.5 mol or less per one liter of polishing composition. The preferred range will vary depending on the type of inorganic salt, the pH of the polishing composition, and other such factors.</div>

The polishing rates of the polishing compositions were measured by the above-described method, resulting in the values shown in Table 4. It can be understood from Table 4 that each of the polishing compositions of the present invention to which an inorganic salt was added also had higher polishing rates than the reference polishing compositions, which did not have inorganic salts. Additionally, in comparative example 3, ammonia was added to the reference polishing composition to raise the pH. The polishing rate was increased by raising the pH. Example 8 and 9 are polishing compositions of the present invention obtained by adding not only ammonia, but also inorganic salts. The polishing rate was even higher than when only ammonia was added. However, this increase was lower than those observed in the low-pH examples 1 and 4.</div>
