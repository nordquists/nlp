<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods of recycling a substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods of recycling a substrate having a stepped portion on an edge region of the substrate that is used for a process for manufacturing a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, as semiconductor devices have become highly integrated, leakage current in a junction region caused by a parasite capacitance may increase the power consumption of the semiconductor device. This may block semiconductor device fabrication requiring a rapid operation speed and a relatively low power. Particularly, as the channel length of a transistor, which may occupy a large area of the semiconductor device, has been reduced to no more than about 0.5 μm, the integration degree of semiconductor substrates has increased. Therefore, a junction capacitance and a leakage current in source/drain electrodes of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor may be increased. As a result, to provide the semiconductor device with a rapid operational speed and a low power by reducing the parasite capacitance and the leakage current, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate has been used.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The SOI substrate may have a structure including a single crystalline semiconductor layer on an insulator. During manufacture of a semiconductor device, an isolation process may be readily carried out on the SOI substrate. Further, the SOI substrate may have improved electrical characteristics such as a low voltage of below about 1V of an electronic circuit element, a high speed, a low power, etc. The SOI substrate may be used for an ultra large-scale integrated (ULSI) circuit, a Gb-DRAM, a radiation-resistant high circuit, a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS), a solar cell, etc.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The SOI may be manufactured by a separation implanted oxygen (SIMOX) method or by an ion cutting method. According to the SIMOX method, oxygen atoms are implanted into a silicon substrate to form a substrate doped with the oxygen atoms. The substrate doped with the oxygen atoms is then annealed to form the SOI substrate. A trench is then formed at a surface portion of the SOI substrate. The trench is filled with an insulation layer to form a field region and an active region of the SOI substrate. When a fundamental electrode of the MOS transistor is formed on the SOI substrate, source/drain electrodes of the MOS transistor may make contact with an insulation layer under a silicon layer in the active region so that a junction capacitance and a leakage current may not exist. As a result, a semiconductor substrate for use in a semiconductor device operating with a lower power and rapid operational speed may be obtained. Further, devices may be electrically isolated from each other by the insulation layer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast, according to the ion cutting method, substrates having insulation layers are attached to each other. The attached substrates are then etched-back. Particularly, hydrogen ions are implanted into a donor substrate having a silicon oxide layer to form an ion implantation region in the donor substrate. The donor substrate is overlapped with a handling substrate to form a stacked structure. The stacked structure is combined at a high temperature. The donor substrate is then separated from the ion implantation region. The handling substrate is thermally treated and chemically mechanically polished to form the SOI substrate having a low surface roughness. The SOI substrate manufactured by the ion cutting method may have improved characteristics such as a uniform thickness, crystallization, etc., compared to that manufactured by the SIMOX method. Further, the ion cutting method may be compatible with a general semiconductor fabrication process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In this instance, the used donor substrate may be recycled in the ion cutting method to decrease the expense of the donor substrate among the total expense of the semiconductor device. Conventional methods of recycling a donor substrate are discussed in Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 2002-85361 and 2005-91071.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The process for recycling the donor substrate may be carried out for removing a stepped portion on an edge region of the separated donor substrate. More specifically, since the edge portion of the donor substrate may have a rounded shape, the rounded edge portion may not be attached to a handling substrate. Thus, the edge portion of the donor substrate may not be separated along a line substantially horizontal with a cut face of the separated donor substrate to form the stepped portion. Further, the process for recycling the donor substrate may be performed to remove a damaged layer, which may cause scratches at the cut face of the separated donor substrate caused by the ion implantation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">In a conventional method of recycling a donor substrate for manufacturing an SOI substrate, a donor substrate having a stepped portion is grinded. A surface of the grinded substrate is then etched using an etching solution. The surface of the etched substrate is thermally treated. Additionally, particles generated in the etching process may be removed by a cleaning process to recycle the donor substrate for manufacturing another SOI substrate. However, the conventional method may include the grinding process, the etching process, the thermal treatment process, etc., so that the donor substrate may be transferred to many units for performing the above-mentioned processes. As a result, the time for recycling the donor substrate may be lengthened and/or the process expensive. Therefore, a technique for recycling a donor substrate with a shortened processing time is desirable.</div>

Further, the primary and the secondary CMP processes may use a polishing pad including polyurethane.</div>

Thus, since the substrate may have improved surface flatness, the substrate may be recycled as a donor substrate for manufacturing an SOI substrate. Since the recycled donor substrate may be reused for a semiconductor fabrication process, the cost of manufacturing a semiconductor device may be curtailed.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">Methods of recycling a substrate in accordance with embodiments of the present invention include performing a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process on a silicon substrate having an edge region on which a stepped portion is formed. In this instance, the CMP process includes a primary CMP process using a first slurry composition including fumed silica, and a secondary CMP process using a second slurry composition including colloidal silica. According to particular embodiments, the stepped portion on the edge region of the substrate is removed by the primary CMP process. The surface roughness of the substrate can then be improved by the secondary CMP process. As a result, a substrate having a flat surface is completed by the primary and secondary CMP processes. According to embodiments of the invention, the first slurry composition used in the primary CMP process includes fumed silica abrasive particles, a pH control additive, a particle size control additive, and water as a dispersant. In this exemplary embodiment, the fumed silica used as the abrasive may be formed by oxidizing tetrachlorosilane (SiCl<sub>4</sub>) at a temperature of about 1,100° C. under a hydrogen and oxygen atmosphere. Further, the fumed silica abrasive particles may be present in an amount of about 5% to about 20% by weight with respect to a total weight of the first slurry composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">In further embodiments, the pH control additive may include potassium hydroxide present in an amount of about 0.1% to about 3.0% by weight with respect to the total weight of the first slurry composition. Further, the first slurry composition containing the pH control additive may have a basic pH of about 8 to about 12, and in some embodiments, about 11 to about 12.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0033" num="0032">According to some embodiments, the particle size control additive is added to the silica abrasive particles to control the particle size of the first slurry composition. In this exemplary embodiment, the particle size control additive may include ammonium salt such as alkyl trimethylammonium chloride, alkyl trimethylammonium bromide, etc. The alkyl may be a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>30 </sub>alkyl. Examples of the ammonium may include tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium bromide, cethyltrimethylammonium chloride, cethyltrimethylammonium bromide, octyl decyltrimethylammonium chloride, etc. The ammonium salt may be present in an amount from about 0.01% to about 1.0% by weight with respect to the total weight of the first slurry composition. The fumed silica including the ammonium salt may have an average particle distribution of about 5 nm to about 500 nm. Further, the first slurry composition including the fumed silica may have a high polish removal rate with respect to polysilicon and silicon oxide. In contrast, the first slurry composition including the fumed silica may not have an etching selectivity with respect to polysilicon and silicon oxide. In this instance, the primary CMP process may use a polishing pad including a hard material. For example, the polishing pad may include polyurethane.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">According to embodiments of the present invention, the second slurry composition used in the secondary CMP process includes colloidal silica abrasive particles, a process aid additive, chelate and water as a dispersant. In this exemplary embodiment, the colloidal silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) used as the abrasive particles may be obtained by forming alkoxysilane by a sol-gel reaction between silicon and alcohol, by hydrating the alkoxysilane, and by filtering byproducts generated during the hydration process. The colloidal silica may be present in an amount from about 0.01% to about 20.0% by weight with respect to a total weight of the second slurry composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">In further embodiments, the process aid additive may include potassium hydroxide and potassium bicarbonate. The potassium hydroxide and the potassium bicarbonate may be present in an amount from about 0.15% to about 1.0% by weight with respect to the total weight of the second slurry composition. In this exemplary embodiment, an amount of the potassium hydroxide may be two times that of the potassium bicarbonate. The process aid additive may satisfactorily suppress cohesion of the colloidal silica in the second slurry composition to reduce surface damage of an object that may be generated after polishing the object. In some embodiments, the chelate may suppress pollution caused by metal impurities in the second slurry composition. The chelate may effectively capture a metal such as iron, nickel, calcium, chrome, zinc, etc. Examples of the chelate may include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acid compounds such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, diethylene triamine hentaacetic acid, triethylenetetramine hexaacetic acid, etc. The chelate may be present in an amount of about 0.03% to about 0.50% by weight with respect to the total weight of the second slurry composition. In this exemplary embodiment, the second slurry composition may have a basic pH of about 8 to about 12, and in some embodiments, about 11 to about 12. In this instance, the size and the amount of the abrasive particles used in the first and the second slurry compositions may affect the polishing efficiency of the polishing process. When the abrasive particles in the first and second slurry compositions have a larger size, high stresses may be applied to the stepped portion simultaneously with the polishing speed of the substrate being increased when the first and the second slurry compositions make contact with the substrate. The high stresses may cause grains to partially detach from the surface of the substrate. In contrast, when the abrasive particles in the first and the second slurry compositions are smaller, the grains may not be detached from the surface of the substrate when the first and the second slurry compositions make contact with the substrate. However, since the surface of the substrate may deteriorate after the polishing process, the size of the abrasive particles may have a more appropriate size. Further, the polishing speed of the substrate may be decreased. Therefore, to rapidly remove the stepped portion of the substrate, the fumed silica abrasive particles in the first slurry composition may have an average particle distribution of about 5 nm to about 500 nm. Further, to reduce the surface roughness of the substrate surface, the colloidal silica abrasive particles in the second slurry composition may have an average particle distribution of about 10 nm to about 60 nm smaller than that of the fumed silica abrasive particles. Thus, when the substrate is polished using the first and the second slurry compositions, the polished substrate may have a flat surface. Further, the secondary CMP process may employ a polishing pad having a hard material similar to the primary CMP process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0035">In this exemplary embodiment, the polishing pad may include polyurethane. Particularly, the second slurry composition including the colloidal silica may have an increased polishing speed with respect to polysilicon, and a slower polishing speed with respect to silicon oxide. That is, when the second slurry composition has a polishing selectivity with respect to the polysilicon, the second slurry composition may be properly applied to remove the polysilicon after performing the primary CMP process.</div>
