</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, an SiC substrate is formed by slicing an ingot made of an SiC single crystal. The sliced SiC substrate may have a substrate defect, for example, a crystal strain due to a damage that is generated at a slicing process. Thus, when a semiconductor device is manufactured using the SiC substrate, a surface portion of the sliced SiC substrate is lapped and the SiC substrate is treated with a chemical mechanical polishing process (CMP process) for removing the substrate defect, before forming a semiconductor element on the SiC substrate, for example, as described in JP-A-7-80770.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the substrate defect may include a crystal strain. The crystal strain is exposed by an anneal process during forming the semiconductor element, but the crystal strain is difficult to be observed before the CMP process. Thus, it is difficult to know a thickness of the SiC substrate that is required to be polished at the CMP process for removing the substrate defect. Therefore, conventionally, a predetermined thickness of the SiC substrate is removed. However, when the substrate defect is located at a deep portion of the SiC substrate, the substrate defect may remain. In contrast, when the substrate defect is located at a shallow portion of the SiC substrate, the CMP process takes extra time to remove a portion of the SiC substrate that is not required to be removed.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Then, the surface of the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is lapped, and thereby the surface roughness <b>2</b> of the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is almost removed. At the present time, substrate defects remain at a surface portion of the SiC substrate <b>1</b>. However, the substrate defects are difficult to be observed. In a manufacturing process according to a comparative example (CE), the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is treated with a CMP process just after the lapping process, as a manner similar to the prior art. In a manufacturing process according to the present embodiment (E1), the substrate defects generated at the surface portion of the SiC substrate <b>1</b> are exposed before the CMP process.</div>

The SiC substrate <b>1</b> is heat-treated under an atmosphere in which the surface of the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is not oxidized, that is, under a nonoxidizing atmosphere.

Once the substrate defects <b>3</b> are exposed, the substrate defects <b>3</b> keep the exposed state even after the temperature of the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is decreased.
