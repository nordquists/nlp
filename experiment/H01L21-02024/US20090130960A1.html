</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The patent application relates to a method for producing a semiconductor wafer with a polished edge, which method involves using a polishing cloth containing fixed abrasive for polishing the edge. The polishing of the edge by means of such a polishing cloth is abbreviated to “FA” polishing hereinafter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The machining of the edge of a semiconductor wafer is receiving increasing attention. A smooth edge having a predetermined edge form is required. The edge form is usually produced by grinding the rough edge of a semiconductor wafer sliced for a crystal. In order to smooth the edge and to remove crystal lattice damage left in the course of grinding, it is necessary for the edge to be polished. This can be done using a polishing cloth containing no fixed abrasive. In this case, the polishing is effected in the presence of a slurry containing free abrasive. By comparison with this edge polishing, referred to hereinafter as cloth polishing for short, FA polishing has the advantage of obviating the comparatively complicated handling of slurry and enabling higher throughputs. This advantage is opposed by the disadvantage that the polished edge is less smooth. U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,423 B1 proposes etching the edge after the FA polishing in order to reduce its roughness.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">As already mentioned, besides the low roughness of the edge, attention must also be paid to ensuring that the form of the edge meets the requirements. With regard to this it can be established that a polishing of one or both sides of the semiconductor wafer disadvantageously alters the form of the edge. Moreover, this problem cannot be solved by choosing a process chain, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,730, for example, which provides a cloth polishing of the edge only after a first polishing of the sides of the semiconductor wafer.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to propose a method which makes it possible to produce a semiconductor wafer with a polished edge which fully meets the requirements with regard to roughness and form.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other objects are achieved by means of a method for producing a semiconductor wafer with a polished edge, comprising polishing at least one side of the semiconductor wafer; and polishing the edge of the polished semiconductor wafer, wherein the edge is polished in the presence of a polishing agent by means of a polishing cloth containing fixed abrasive.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention exploits the unexpected advantage that the form of the edge of the polished semiconductor wafer can be corrected by means of an FA polishing, but not by means of a cloth polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The method is applied to a semiconductor wafer whose edge has already undergone a shaping machining step, preferably a grinding step, but whose edge has not yet been polished. The method begins with the polishing of at least one side of the semiconductor wafer. This involves a single-side polishing or a double-side polishing. A double-side polishing carried out simultaneously is preferred. A suitable machine for double-side polishing is described for example in DE 100 07 390 A1. During the polishing, the semiconductor wafer lies in a cutout, provided therefor, in a carrier acting as a guide cage and between an upper and a lower polishing plate. At least one polishing plate and the carrier are rotated, and the semiconductor wafer moves, with a polishing agent being supplied, on a path predetermined by a rolling curve, relative to the polishing plates covered with polishing cloth. The polishing pressure with which the polishing plates press on to the semiconductor wafer and the duration of the polishing are parameters which crucially codetermine the material removal brought about by means of the polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The polishing of at least one side of the semiconductor wafer is preferably performed as removal polishing, that is to say with the aim of removing material with a thickness of at least 5 μm from the semiconductor wafer side to be polished.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Alterations of the edge form which are attributable to the polishing of one or both sides of the semiconductor wafer are corrected by an FA polishing of the edge.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">A polishing cloth containing fixed abrasive, for example particles of silicon carbide, silicon dioxide or diamond, is used during the FA polishing. In accordance with one embodiment, the FA polishing is effected in the presence of a liquid polishing agent, for example in the presence of water. For smoothing the edge, that is to say for reducing the roughness thereof, in this case use is preferably made of a polishing cloth having particularly fine abrasive, preferably with a mesh size of not less than 4000, that is to say with an average particle diameter of not more than 5 μm, more preferably not more than 4 μm. A multistage FA polishing in the course of which polishing is effected using finer and finer abrasive and which is concluded with the fine abrasive is also particularly suitable. Such a polishing step sequence and suitable polishing devices are described for example in US 2006/0252355 A1.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a second embodiment of the method, the FA polishing is performed in the presence of a slurry containing free abrasive, for example colloidal silicon dioxide or cerium oxide.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">A third embodiment involves carrying out firstly an FA polishing in the presence of a liquid polishing agent and then a cloth polishing in the presence of a slurry containing free abrasive, for example colloidal silicon dioxide or cerium oxide. In this case, the average particle diameter of the fixed abrasive in the polishing cloth can be larger than when the subsequent cloth polishing is dispensed with. The use of a polishing cloth having fixed abrasive with a mesh of 1000 to 2000, that is to say with an average particle diameter of 7 to 25 μm, is preferred when a subsequent cloth polishing is carried out. The duration of the cloth polishing can be made very short, for example 15 to 30 s.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The method according to the invention preferably also comprises a polishing of the front side of the semiconductor wafer that is carried out as a single-side polishing. The front side of the semiconductor wafer is deemed to be that side of the semiconductor wafer on which provision is made for constructing electronic components. The single-side polishing, referred to hereinafter as CMP (“chemical-mechanical polishing”), is preferably performed as luster polishing with the aim of providing a smoothest possible side surface. The material removal of the CMP, with a thickness of at most 1 μm, is significantly smaller than in the case of a removal polishing. The CMP of the front side is preferably carried out after the double-side polishing and before or after the FA polishing.</div>
