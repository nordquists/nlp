<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">Cost effective processing of integrated circuits formed on a semiconductor wafer requires full functionality of the components over the available top surface of the wafer. Major efforts have been made to minimize process variations over the wafer area, for example, in the region close to the wafer edge. An industry specification requires yielding integrated circuit components which are fully located inside an area reaching from the wafer center out to an edge exclusion of 2 mm, with a target being extended to an edge exclusion of 1.5 mm in the near future. In order to accomplish this target, it is important to control each parameter influencing the result of every processing step. One realization is that the shape of the wafer edge is one of those parameters, since a plurality of process steps are influenced by this shape. The precise shape of the wafer edge is initially defined by the wafer material supplier, but also modified during the course of processing steps, resulting in a need to actively control and/or adapt to this shape.</div>

In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “back,” “leading,” “trailing,” etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</div>

The wafer backside <b>180</b> (including its projection <b>180</b>′) usually does not contain functional components and runs in parallel to the upper surface <b>150</b>. The reference plane <b>100</b> is located in the center between the upper surface <b>150</b> and the wafer backside <b>180</b> and intersects with the wafer surface at the outer wafer edge <b>110</b>, thus defining the wafer perimeter.</div>

Some exemplary mechanisms are described in the following, leading to an influence of the wafer shape to the process performance, but embodiments are not be limited by these examples, and it is possible for other processes and other mechanisms to be effective, as well.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">One example of such a process is chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). A wafer is pressed with the upper surface <b>150</b> against a polishing pad through a wafer carrier comprising a retaining ring. The pad is moved relative to the wafer, so that the pad portion, which enters the contact region between the pad and the carrier with the wafer, first contacts the retaining ring, and then makes initial contact to the wafer in the bevel region. The slope of the bevel region will accordingly influence the compression dynamics of the pad, and therefore the effective force between the wafer and the pad in the following time interval. Due to the continuing movement of the pad relative to the wafer, this time interval translates into a wafer radius, so that the local pressure and thus the local polishing rate in an outer zone of the upper wafer surface <b>150</b> outer becomes a function of the wafer shape. Additionally, the bevel region will be polished during the CMP process, causing a shape modification as well.</div>

One group of product wafers with a shape <b>1000</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>a</i>, was divided into a reference subgroup and a reshaping subgroup. The wafers of the reshaping subgroup were subjected to a shaping process transforming the edge shape into the profile <b>1010</b>, while the edge shape of the reference subgroup was not changed. The shaping step removed an amount of about 50 μm in the upper wafer bevel region extending up to 0.5 mm from the wafer edge, while less than 20 μm was removed in the lower wafer bevel region. Both subgroups were processed by a subsequent CMP step under volume manufacturing conditions and using the same process parameters. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>b </i>illustrates the normalized removal of both subgroups as a function of wafer radius. As can be seen, the CMP removal of the reshaping subgroup deviates less from the wafer average 1.0 than the reference subgroup at the wafer edge, thus allowing to keep the removal within a given specification of +−5% of the average removal until the outermost measurement point located at 147 mm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Another example of an interaction between the wafer shape and the process performance is a lithography process. A resist coated wafer is chucked, and a focus height measurement is commenced to determine the location of the upper wafer surface <b>150</b>. A scanning probe, for example, a laser probe, may be used. When this probe enters the roll off region, and the bevel region, the wafer surface will deviate from the horizontal course, causing errors in determining the focus height. Additionally, the chucking force applied from the wafer backside <b>180</b> will deform the wafer, and this deformation will be influenced by the wafer shape. Therefore, the wafer shape will determine the area of the wafer, for which the resist coating can be maintained within the available focus window during the exposure process.</div>

The wafer shape has a direct influence on the electrical fields at the wafer edge, as well as the gas flow and partial pressures in the wafer edge region, especially if a cooling gas is used. This may lead to non-uniformities at the wafer edge in etch rate, etch selectivity, CD values, and/or alignment of the etched features (for example, tilted contact holes).</div>

The upper wafer shape before reshaping <b>200</b> is transformed into the upper wafer shape after reshaping <b>210</b>. The thickness <b>220</b> of the layer removed during the reshaping process can be defined through the parameterization procedure described above along the line between the wafer surface point and the reference point <b>290</b>.

The thickness of the removed portion may be the same for the upper and lower wafer shapes, or may be different, including the case that the upper or lower shape is not modified at all during the reshaping process. In an implementation, the reshaping transforms a round type wafer into a blunt type wafer (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for the upper bevel) or vice versa (not illustrated). In a different implementation, a first blunt type shape <b>240</b> is transformed into a second blunt type shape <b>250</b> (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for the lower bevel) with a different facet angle.</div>

Suitable polishing tools are available from various suppliers, while plasma etching tools also have configurations to remove portions of the wafer edge selectively to the wafer center. Spin etching tools can also be configured to apply the etching chemistries selectively to the wafer edge. In order to achieve a significant shape modification, a minimum removal thickness of 1 μm in at least a portion of the wafer edge region is required, for example, a removal around 10 μm and above lead to noticeable effect in most of the shape sensitive unit processes described above. In one implementation, for example, a thickness of about 50 μm was removed, but also values exceeding 100 μm are feasible to practice embodiments. The removal amount for reshaping is higher than the amount removed in edge defect removal processes, in which the removal is generally limited to an amount effective to promote the release of the defects from the wafer surface. The removal values given include any layers deposited onto the bevel regions, which may also contribute to shape modifications observed during the course of processing steps.</div>

These shape modifying processes include, but are not limited to, chemical mechanical polishing processes (CMP), reactive ion etching (RIE) processes, chemical and physical vapor deposition processes (CVD, PVD), wet etching processes, and spin on processes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>3</b> <i>b </i>illustrate exemplary modifications induced by such processes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>a </i>illustrates the shape of a wafer before (<b>320</b>) and after (<b>310</b>) a first shape modifying process. In the upper portion of the wafer edge, wafer material is excessively removed, and may lead to a step <b>300</b> in the shape. Such shapes have been observed, for example, after RIE processes, and may be caused by a local plasma-related erosion. Sharp shape features like the step <b>300</b> may lead to yield problems later, for example, through break off of wafer material or layers deposited onto such features at a later process step. Wafer chucking failure may also be caused by such features. Step heights around 30 μm have been observed, so that removal of these features require a removal in excess of this step height, that is, 30 μm in this case.</div>

Then, further processing is performed on the wafer to a second manufacturing stage. This second stage may be the final stage of processing the wafer, or may be a stage, at which another reshaping step is performed. The process performance (as measured, for example, as component yield) of the further processing is influenced by the shape of the processed wafer. CMP processes, lithographic exposure, and RIE show a process performance influenced by the wafer shape, as described above. The region, in which the process performance is influenced, may be the extreme edge region of a width of a few millimeters, but may as well extend several centimeters towards the wafer center, as observed, for example, in the case of CMP. The reshaping step may in one implementation compensate for a shape modification introduced by the processes to achieve the first manufacturing stage, thereby recovering the initial shape.

The reshaping step would in such case be performed between the FEOL and the BEOL.

The docking unit <b>960</b> is capable to receive wafer material for processing within the wafer shaping apparatus. For example, the docking unit <b>960</b> can receive multiple lots, like from a overhead transportation system, and interfaces mechanically with the wafer handling unit <b>910</b>, which is configured to transport the wafers between the units of the wafer shaping apparatus <b>900</b>. The sequence of wafer movements between the units and the processing information for the units are controlled by a control unit <b>950</b>. A shaping unit <b>920</b> performs the shape modification process and includes a device for polishing, dry or wet etching, or electrochemical etching the wafer edge. Optionally, a separate cleaning unit <b>930</b> may be included in the wafer shaping apparatus <b>900</b>, or may form part of the shaping unit <b>920</b>. The cleaning unit is configured to clean the wafer from residues of the shaping process, and may include a rinsing and/or brush cleaning module, as well as a drying module, like a spin-rinse-dryer or a marangoni dryer.</div>

The shape measurement data may be transmitted to the control unit <b>950</b>. The wafer may be transferred to the measurement unit <b>940</b> before and/or after processing in the shaping unit <b>920</b>. A comparison of the shape data with a target shape may be performed, and the processing as well as the sequence of movement of a specific wafer between units may depend on the comparison result. For example, a second (rework) shaping process may be automatically performed if the measured shape after the first shaping process differs from the predetermined target shape by an amount higher than a predetermined rework threshold.</div>
