<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In a polishing process of a semiconductor, particularly a silicon wafer, a polishing composition containing colloidal silica as abrasive grains has been in much use (for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-38954 (Patent Document 1)). With recent high integration of a silicon device, the restriction to contamination or defects of the polished silicon wafer has been increasingly severe. For example, contamination due to minute amounts of metals remaining on the polished silicon wafer or occurrence of flaws due to an agglomerate of silica contained in an abrasive has become of a significant issue and therefore, deterioration of a yield ratio in a device manufacturing process attributable to such contamination or defect is unavoidable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">It is found out that the minute amounts of the metals remaining in the polished silicon wafer are attributable to metals contained in a polishing composition, and most of the metal impurities derive from colloidal silica. Therefore, it is required to reduce a content of the metal impurities of the polishing composition, particularly a content of impurities of colloidal silica. In response to this demand, there is proposed a method of using a polishing composition containing the colloidal silica with a high purity (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-214338 (Patent Document 2)). However, such a polishing composition with a high purity is generally expensive and therefore, the problem with costs occurs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is proposed a method of polishing a silicon wafer with a polishing composition which does not substantially contain colloidal silica contained in the conventional polishing composition (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-259769 (Patent Document 3)). However, since the polishing composition which does not substantially contain the colloidal silica has no function of removing an oxidized layer (hereinafter, also called natural oxidized layer) generated on a silicon wafer surface as a polished article, the polishing can not be performed substantially.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For the purpose of removing a natural oxidized layer, although it is an example used in a polishing process, there is the example that an the natural oxidized layer is removed with a HF solution before the polishing process and thereafter, the polishing is performed with a polishing composition which does not substantially contain colloidal silica (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-16025 (Patent Document 4)). However, the process of removing the natural oxidized layer with the HF solution is complicated and the silicon wafer on which the natural oxidized layer is removed in the process of removing the natural oxidized layer with the HF solution has a surface which is unprotected in the duration until the silicon wafer is transferred to the next polishing process. Therefore, the silicon wafer is exposed to various contaminations. The complicated situation of the use of HF or dangerous situation against various contaminations is true of precision polishing, as well as rough polishing.</div>

Since it is conventionally considered that polishing a silicon wafer with cerium oxide causes flaws thereon, the cerium oxide is considered to be unsuitable for polishing the silicon wafer. Therefore, the cerium oxide has not been so far used in the polishing composition for the silicon wafer. The present invention is made based upon the finding that the cerium oxide can efficiently remove an oxidized layer (natural oxidized layer) generated on a surface of a silicon wafer. The polishing composition of the present invention can efficiently remove the natural oxidized layer by using the polishing composition in a state of containing minute amounts of the cerium oxide upon polishing.</div>

However, there is the possibility for metal impurities to be mixed in the manufacture or the use of the polishing composition. Therefore, it is preferable to use the chelating agent for trapping the metal impurities.
