<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic components such as ICs, LSIs or ULSIs which applying semiconductor materials, such as silicon single crystal, as raw material can be manufactured based on a small semiconductor device chips. Said small semiconductor device chips are fabricated by dicing thin disk shaped wafers on which a number of fine electronic circuits are built to semiconductor chips, where the wafers are fabricated by slicing a single crystal ingot of silicon or semiconductors of other compound to thin disk shaped wafers. A wafer sliced from the ingot is processed into a mirror wafer with a mirror finished surface and edge through the processes of lapping, etching, and polishing. In following device manufacturing process, fine electric circuits are formed on the mirror finished surface of the wafer. At present, from the view point of developing high speed LSIs, material for wiring has changed from conventional Al to Cu, which is characterized to have lower electric resistance. Also an insulation film existing between wirings has changed from a silicon oxidation film to a low permittivity film which is characterized to have lower permittivity. Further, for the purpose of protecting the diffusion of Cu into the low permittivity film, a wiring forming process is shifting to a new process that interposing a barrier film which is made from tantalum or tantalum nitride between Cu and the low permittivity film. According to such a circuit structure formation and a high integration requirement, a polishing process is carried out frequently and repeatedly to planarize the interlayer insulation film, to form a metal plug between upper and lower wirings, to form an embedded wiring or the like. Generally, the polishing step is processed by rotating the semiconductor wafer which is placed on and pressed against a platen on which a polishing cloth made from synthetic resin foam, suede-like synthetic leather or the like is applied, while a quantitative amount of polishing compound solution is supplied so as to polish the semiconductor wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">On the edge surface of the wafer, above mentioned metal films or the like are disorderly accumulated. Before dicing the wafer to semiconductor device chips, various wafer transportation processes exist. The wafer is supported at the edge when it is a subject to the transportation and the like while keeping an initial disk shape. If outermost periphery edge of the wafer is unevenly structured at the transportation, minute crushes are caused at the edge part of the wafer when the wafer collides with a transporting device and fine particles will arise. The fine particles arisen will scatter and contaminate the precisely processed wafer surface, and affect seriously on the yield and the quality of products. To prevent the contamination by the fine particles, the edge part of the semiconductor wafer is required to have a mirror polishing process after the metal films or the other are formed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Above mentioned edge polishing is performed by a method mentioned below. First, an edge part of a semiconductor wafer is pressed against a polishing machine which has a polishing cloth supporter, on which a polishing cloth made from synthetic resin foam, synthetic leather, nonwoven fabric or the like is applied. Then, the polishing cloth supporter and/or the wafer are rotated while a polishing compound solution which containing polishing particles, such as silica, as a main component is supplied. As the polishing particles to be contained in said polishing compound, one can use colloidal silica which is similar to the one used for edge polishing of a silicon wafer, fumed silica, cerium oxide or alumina that is used for surface polishing of a device wafer, or the like. Especially, colloidal silica and fumed silica claim attention because both silica are fine particles and smooth mirror surface can be easily obtained. The polishing compound mentioned above is also called as “slurry”, which may be called as such in some cases below.</div>

The polishing mechanism can be described as a combination of a chemical action by the alkaline components, specifically, chemical corrosion of a surface of silicon oxide films, metal films, and the like by the alkaline components, and a mechanical polishing action by silica particles. More specifically, by the corrosive action by the alkaline components, thin and soft eroded layer is formed on a surface of an object to be polished such as a wafer. Said eroded layer is removed by the mechanical polishing action by fine polishing particles. By repeating said actions, the polishing process will be progressed.</div>

According to “International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors”, target width of device wiring is 50 nm in 2010 and 35 nm in 2013. Considering finer tendency of width of device wiring, copper or copper alloy has become in use as a wiring material. As a polishing compound to be used for semiconductor polishing, oxidative components of copper or selective etching components other than alkaline components are recommended. Especially, amines claim attention as an agent that seldom over etches a wafer, however, a problem has not been solved. Since over etching of device wiring on the semiconductor wafer surface inhibits an operation of a device, it is a serious problem.</div>

In Patent Document 2, a polishing compound prepared by dispersing polishing particles in an imidazole aqueous solution or a methylimidazole aqueous solution is disclosed. According to the document, said polishing compound forms a copper complex which is water soluble and never produces water insoluble solid matter other then polishing particles. Therefore, said polishing compound can prevent scratches and can also prevent dishing because it controls etching of a copper oxide layer. In Patent Document 3, a polishing compound prepared by adding diethylenediamine or piperidine to colloidal silica is disclosed.

<heading id="h-0007">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036">By using the polishing composition of present invention, one can obtain excellent effect in preventing over etching in polishing of a semiconductor wafer and the like. “Over etching” is a phenomenon that causes by corrosion of a wiring metal which results formation of recesses during polishing process of the wiring metal, an insulation film or a barrier film. Over etching occurs when a balance of corrosive speed between a mechanical polishing action by polishing particles and a corrosive action by alkaline component is broken. Over etching is recognized as a ground of defective products such as corrosive pits, wiring corrosions or key holes of tungsten wiring. Further, since said polishing composition does not contain alkali metals, problems such as remaining of polishing particles or dispersion of alkali metal to wiring layer can be prevented. So, the present invention has great influence to the relating field.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0008">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned above, nitrogen containing basic compounds are the useful agents in metal polishing and are disclosed in many Patent Documents. On the other hand, polishing composition for semiconductor wafer polishing comprising, colloidal silica prepared from an active silicic acid aqueous solution obtained by removal of alkali from alkali silicate and at least one nitrogen containing basic compound selected from a group consisting of ethylenediamine, diethylenediamine, imidazole, methylimidazole, piperidine, morpholine, arginine, and hydrazine, is a new invention by the inventors of the present invention. And the fact that said colloidal silica can display great polishing ability while polishing a subject such as silicon wafer or the like is first shown in the present invention. Said polishing composition of the present invention can prevent over etching according to its close-neutral pH in spite of the alkali amount, can keep adequate polishing ability according to nonspherical shape of silica, and can keep the polishing ability according to existence of buffer solution.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038">Ethylenediamine is a strong base whose pKa is of about 9.9 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 11.8. There are two sorts of ethylenediamine: ethylenediamine anhydride and ethylenediamine mono hydrate. Ethylenediamine mono hydrate is preferred because it is less dangerous agent. Another name of diethylenediamine is piperazine and is also known as hexahydropyrazine or diethyleneimine. There are two sorts of diethylenediamine: diethylenediamine anhydride and diethylenediamine hexahydrate. Diethylenediamine hexahydrate is easier to use. Diethylenediamine is a strong base whose pKa is about 9.8 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 11.5. Imidazole is a weak base whose pKa is about 6.9 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 10.2. 2-methylimidazole is a weak base whose pKa is about 7.8 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 10.7. 4-methylimidazole can also be used instead of 2-methylimidazole. Other names of piperidine are hexahydropyridine and pentamethyleneimine. Piperidine is a strong alkali whose pKa is about 11.1 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 12.3. Morpholine is a slightly weak base whose pKa is about 8.4 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 10.8. Arginine is one of amino acids which also known as 5-guadidino-2-amino pentanoic acid and is a base whose pKa is about 12.5 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 10.5 because it possesses a carboxy group. Although each of D-, L- or DL-arginine can be used, L-arginine is preferably used among three because of low price. There are two sorts of hydrazine: hydrazine anhydrous and hydrazine monohydrate (also known as hydrohydrazine or hydrazine hydrate). Hydrazine monohydrate is preferred because it is less dangerous agent. Hydrazine is a strong reducing agent, however, as a base, it is a weak base whose pKa is about 8.1 and a pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 9.9.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">Above mentioned nitrogen containing basic compounds act as a polymerization catalyst of silica of an active silicic acid aqueous solution due to its basic feature. That is, colloidal particles can be obtained by heating the active silicic acid aqueous solution after alkalizing the solution by adding said nitrogen containing basic compounds. In the meanwhile, said nitrogen containing basic compounds affect particle form at a growing process of colloidal particles. Said nitrogen containing basic compounds bond with or adsorbs to surfaces of silica particles in the growing process and inhibits growing of particles at bonded parts and disturbs spherical growing of particles.</div>

When the pH is lower than 8.5, polishing rate becomes slow and is out of practical use. Further, when the pH is higher than 11.0, the solution over etches nonpolishing parts of a wafer and deteriorates a flatness of the wafer and is also out of practical use.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, it is desirable that a pH of the solution does not change easily by exterior conditions such as abrasion, heating, contacting with outer atmosphere, mixing with other components or the like. Especially, in a case of edge polishing, a polishing compound is used by a circulation flow. That is, the polishing compound supplied from a slurry tank to polishing parts sent back to the slurry tank so that to be reused. In a case of a polishing compound that contains an alkalizing agent alone, a pH of the solution falls in short time since the solution is diluted with pure water used in the circulation flow. The phenomenon is caused by influx of pure water, which is used as cleaning water. Alternation of the pH affects a polishing rate, and lack of polishing or over polishing is easily caused.</div>

Therefore, in the present invention, it is desirable to make polishing composition itself a strong buffer solution that does not change a pH dramatically according to exterior conditions. To form a buffer solution, a method of blending a buffer composed of mixing a week acid and a strong base can be mentioned. For example, a method of adding carbonated tetraalkylammonium aqueous solution which prepared by neutralizing tetraalkylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution with carbon dioxide gas to adjust pH of 8.5 to 11.0 to colloidal silica can be mentioned. Further, as another method, a method of adding a buffer solution prepared by mixing a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution and a tetraalkylammonium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution by optional compounding to adjust pH of 8.5 to 11.0 to colloidal silica can be mentioned.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">An active silicic acid aqueous solution used in the present invention is obtained by removal of alkali from a silicic alkali aqueous solution by using cation exchange resin. For a silicic alkali aqueous solution, sodium silicate aqueous solution called “water glass (water glass number 1 to 4 or the like)”, are generally used as raw material. This is comparably inexpensive and easy to obtain. Also a potassium silicate aqueous solution fits to the need since semiconductors dislike the contamination by Na ion. There is another way to obtain a silicic alkali aqueous solution, such as the way to dissolve metasilicate alkali solid to water. There is less contaminated metasilicate alkali solid since it requires crystallization process to obtain. One can dilute a silicic alkali aqueous solution with water by their need.</div>

First, dilute a silicic aqueous solution with water so that to adjust SiO<sub>2 </sub>concentration of dilution of 3 to 10 weight %. Then acid can be removed by contacting with H type strong acid cation-exchange resin. One can use OH type strong basic anion-exchange resin after above mentioned process by the need.

At the end, above mentioned active silicic acid aqueous solution and an alkalizing agent or above mentioned active silicic acid aqueous solution, the nitrogen containing basic compounds, and the alkalizing agent are added to the colloidal solution formed in the previous process while maintaining in alkaline condition under heating condition to grow colloidal solution (a particles growing process).
