</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">A GaN crystal substrate is very useful as a substrate for a semiconductor device such as a light emitting element, an electronic element, or a semiconductor sensor. Such a GaN crystal substrate is formed by cutting a GaN crystal grown by vapor phase epitaxy such as HYPE (hydride vapor phase epitaxy) or MOVPE (metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy) into substrates of a predetermined shape, and grinding, lapping, and/or etching a main surface thereof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to obtain a semiconductor device having excellent properties by forming at least one semiconductor layer having good crystallinity (meaning orderliness of atomic arrangement in a crystal; hereinafter the same applies) on a crystal growth surface, which is one main surface, of a GaN crystal substrate, there has been proposed a GaN crystal substrate having reduced warpage and surface roughness on a crystal growth surface (see for example Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-012900 (Patent Document 1)).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Even when the crystal growth surface of a GaN crystal substrate has reduced warpage and surface roughness, however, if a rear surface (meaning the other main surface, that is, a surface opposite to the crystal growth surface; hereinafter the same applies) of the GaN crystal substrate has a large warpage, this causes an increase in a gap portion formed between the rear surface of the substrate and a susceptor (meaning a table on which a substrate is disposed; hereinafter the same applies) when a semiconductor layer is formed on the crystal growth surface of the substrate. As a result, heat transferred from the susceptor to the substrate is unevenly distributed, and the semiconductor layer cannot be formed evenly and stably on the crystal growth surface of the substrate. Consequently, there has been a problem that a semiconductor layer having good crystallinity cannot be formed on the crystal growth surface of the substrate, and thus a semiconductor device having excellent properties cannot be obtained. Further, although the rear surface of a GaN crystal substrate generally has a surface roughness greater than a surface roughness of the crystal growth surface, the same problem as described above has occurred when the rear surface has an extremely greater surface roughness.</div>

Warpage w<sub>(R) </sub>is defined as a difference in height between a displacement value z<sub>P </sub>at the most convex portion and a displacement value z<sub>V </sub>at the most concave portion of rear surface <b>10</b> <i>r. </i> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, if warpage w<sub>(R) </sub>of rear surface <b>10</b> <i>r </i>satisfies w<sub>(R)</sub>&lt;−50 μm or w<sub>(R)</sub>&gt;50 μm, a gap portion <b>9</b> <i>s </i>formed between a GaN crystal substrate <b>10</b> and a susceptor <b>9</b> is increased. This results in uneven distribution of heat transferred from susceptor <b>9</b> to GaN crystal substrate <b>10</b> when at least one group-III nitride crystal layer <b>20</b> is grown as a semiconductor layer on crystal growth surface <b>10</b> <i>c </i>of GaN crystal substrate <b>10</b>. As a result, semiconductor layer <b>20</b> cannot be grown evenly and stably, which makes it difficult to manufacture a semiconductor device formed evenly and having excellent properties.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">In view of the above, it is more preferable that rear surface <b>10</b> <i>r </i>has warpage w<sub>(R) </sub>satisfying −35 μm≦w<sub>(R)</sub>≦45 μm.

Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the measurement method is a method of measuring warpage of a rear surface opposite to a crystal growth surface of a substrate using a laser displacement meter, and the substrate is disposed on a substrate support table. The method includes: a substrate detection step S<b>1</b> detecting a plurality of displacement values respectively corresponding to a plurality of measurement points on the rear surface of the substrate using the laser displacement meter; a noise removal step S<b>2</b> removing noise contained in the plurality of displacement values; an outer peripheral portion removal step S<b>3</b> calculating a plurality of displacement values for calculation by removing from the plurality of displacement values those respectively corresponding to the measurement points in an outer peripheral portion of the substrate; a smoothing step S<b>4</b> smoothing the plurality of displacement values for calculation to calculate a warped surface; a best fit plane calculation step S<b>5</b> calculating a best fit plane having the minimum distance to the warped surface; and a warpage calculation step S<b>6</b> calculating as warpage a sum of a distance from the best fit plane to a point represented by the greatest displacement value of the warped surface on one side with respect to the best fit plane and a distance from the best fit plane to a point represented by the greatest displacement value of the warped surface on the other side with respect to the best fit plane. With the measurement method described above, even for a substrate having a rear surface with a high surface roughness (for example, with a surface roughness Ra of not less than 50 nm), the warpage of the rear surface of the substrate can be measured. It is to be noted that surface roughness Ra is a value obtained by sampling a portion having a reference length from a roughness curve in a direction of its mean line, summing up absolute values of deviations from a mean line of the sampled portion to a measurement curve, and calculating an average for the reference length. Further, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the step surrounded with a solid frame is an indispensable step, and the, step surrounded with a dashed frame is an arbitrary step.</div>

There is no particular limitation on the type of the laser, and for example a red color semiconductor laser having a wavelength of 670 nm is used.

Although a laser displacement meter employing the laser focus technique has a lower accuracy than a flatness tester employing optical interferometry, it can measure a rough rear surface with surface roughness Ra of not less than 50 nm. Further, unlike the flatness tester employing optical interferometry, the laser displacement meter employing the laser focus technique can obtain a reflected beam <b>31</b> <i>r</i>, and thus it can analyze and process a displacement value.</div>
