In this case, stringent requirements are made in particular of the flatness of the front sides of the silicon wafers on which the electronic components are produced. This is necessary in order to minimize problems in the course of the exposure of the silicon wafers (lithography) and in the course of intermediate polishing processes (“Chemical Mechanical Polishing”, CMP) during the fabrication of the components.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Polishing the surfaces of semiconductor wafers pursues the goal of removing material from the surfaces of the semiconductor wafers in order to form a planar surface that is as uniform as possible. As a result, an undesirable surface topography and surface defects such as rough surfaces, crystal lattice damage or scratches can be removed and uniform surfaces can be made available for the subsequent further processing.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of double-side polishing (DSP), semiconductor wafers are introduced loosely into a so-called carrier and are polished on the front and rear sides simultaneously in a manner “floating freely” between an upper and a lower polishing plate covered with a polishing pad, with the aid of a polishing sol. The support parts supply a controllable pressure that presses the semiconductor wafer against the polishing support.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In the prior art, the polishing is carried out by relative movement between wafer and polishing pad under pressure and with a polishing agent (slurry) being supplied. The polishing agent is colloidally dispersed silica sol, for example. The polishing pad contains no abrasive. The interplay between mechanically abrasive action of the silica sol and chemical attack of the alkaline polishing agent then brings about the material removal that leads to the smoothing of the wafer surface.</div>

These polishing agent constituents and ultrapure water are processed further in central preparation stations to form the finished polishing agent or to form partial mixtures. The solutions thus produced are usually stored temporarily in suitable containers. The ready to use mixture is conveyed to the consumers via a ring line. The polishing agent is then drawn off for the processing step via a branch line. The used polishing agent is subsequently discarded.</div>
