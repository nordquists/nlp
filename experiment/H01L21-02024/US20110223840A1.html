</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Since substrates or films formed of these materials usually remain stable with respect to chemical action such as oxidation, complexation, and etching, processing the substrates or the films by polishing is not easy. Accordingly, the processing is commonly performed by grinding or cutting using a hard material. However, a highly smooth surface cannot be produced by grinding or cutting.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">A polishing composition of the present embodiment contains at least abrasive grains and water. The polishing composition is used in polishing an object to be polished formed of a substrate material for optical devices, a substrate material for power devices, or a compound semiconductor material, more specifically in polishing a substrate or a film formed of ceramics including oxides such as sapphire, nitrides such as gallium nitride, and carbides such as silicon carbide, or compound semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, or indium phosphide. The polishing composition is preferably used in polishing an object to be polished formed of a material that remains stable with respect to chemical action such as oxidation, complexation, and etching, in particular in polishing a substrate formed of sapphire, gallium nitride, or silicon carbide.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">The abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition may be of, for example, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, zirconium oxide, diamond, or silicon carbide, although not limited thereto. Aluminum oxide and silicon oxide have an advantage in easy availability for readily producing a highly smooth surface having few defects by polishing using the polishing composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The polishing composition contains preferably not less than 0.01% by mass, more preferably not less than 0.1% by mass of the abrasive grains. The more the amount of abrasive grains contained, the more enhanced becomes the rate of polishing an object to be polished using the polishing composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The polishing composition contains preferably not more than 50% by mass, more preferably not more than 40% by mass of the abrasive grains. The less the amount of abrasive grains contained, the more reduced becomes the cost of manufacturing the polishing composition. In addition, a polished surface having few scratches can be more readily produced by polishing using the polishing composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">The polishing composition contains abrasive grains having a mean primary particle diameter of preferably not smaller than 5 nm, more preferably not smaller than 10 nm. The larger the mean primary particle diameter of the abrasive grains, the more enhanced becomes the rate of polishing an object to be polished using the polishing composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The polishing composition contains abrasive grains having a mean primary particle diameter of preferably not larger than 20 μm, more preferably not larger than 10 μm. The smaller the mean primary particle diameter of the abrasive grains, the more readily the surface having fewer defects and a small degree of roughness can be produced by polishing using the polishing composition. The mean primary particle diameter is calculated, for example, from the specific surface of the abrasive grains measured by the BET method. The specific surface of the abrasive grains is measured, for example, with a “Flow SorbII 2300” made by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to polish an object formed of a substrate material for optical devices, a substrate material for power devices, or a compound semiconductor material at an enhanced rate of polishing using the polishing composition, it is important that the abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition are not electrostatically repelled from the object to be polished during polishing. For this reason, the abrasive grains for use have a zeta potential satisfying the relationship X×Y≦0, where X [mV] represents the zeta potential of the abrasive grains measured in the polishing composition and Y [mV] represents the zeta potential of the object to be polished measured during polishing using the polishing composition. When the relationship X×Y≦0 is not satisfied, that is, when the relationship X×Y&gt;0 is satisfied, the abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition are electrostatically repelled from the object to be polished during polishing, which creates difficulty in mechanically polishing the object to be polished with the abrasive grains. As a result, it is difficult to polish the object to be polished at an enhanced rate of polishing using the polishing composition. The expression X×Y has a value preferably not higher than −20 for enhancing the rate of polishing an object to be polished to a level particularly suitable for practical use with the polishing composition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The expression X×Y has a value of preferably not lower than −5,000, and more preferably not lower than −2,000. The higher the value of the expression X×Y, the more readily the abrasive grains attaching to the polished surface of the object to be polished can be removed by washing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">The zeta potential value of the abrasive grains measured in the polishing composition and the zeta potential value of the object to be polished measured during polishing using the polishing composition are affected, for example, by the pH of the polishing composition. Accordingly, the relationship X×Y≦0, preferably the relationship X×Y≦−20 may be satisfied with addition of one or more pH adjusters to the polishing composition. The pH adjuster for use may be either acid or alkali.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, with addition of an adsorptive substance to the polishing composition, the zeta potential value of the object to be polished is varied with the substance adsorbed to the surface of the object to be polished. Accordingly, the relationship X×Y≦0, preferably the relationship X×Y≦−20 may be satisfied with addition of such an adsorptive substance to the polishing composition. The adsorptive substance for use is preferably appropriately selected depending on the types of objects to be polished, and may be, for example, an anionic, cationic, nonionic, or zwitterionic surfactant, an organic matter, or metal ions.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">The zeta potential values of the abrasive grains and the object to be polished are measured by an electrophoretic light scattering method or electroacoustic spectroscopy using, for example, an “ELS-Z” made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. or a “DT-1200” made by Dispersion Technology Inc. Measurement of the zeta potential of the object to be polished may be replaced with measurement of the zeta potential of fine particles composed of the same material as the object to be polished. Alternatively, the object to be polished is immersed in a liquid containing fine particles having a known zeta potential value, taken out from the liquid, and washed with running water for about 10 seconds, and then the surface of the object to be polished may be observed with, for example, a scanning electron microscope. In this case, whether a sign of the zeta potential value of the object to be polished measured in the liquid is positive or negative can be known from the amount of the fine particles attaching to the surface of the object to be polished after washing.</div>

Accordingly, the abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition have such a zeta potential value as not to be electrostatically repelled from the object to be polished during polishing using the polishing composition. Since the abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition are not electrostatically repelled from the object to be polished during polishing, mechanical polishing of the object to be polished is efficiently performed with the abrasive grains.
