<li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained specifically.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, there have been some cases where the problem that particles attach to a wafer surface occurs after a silicon wafer obtained after polishing of a chamfered portion or immersing in hydrofluoric acid to remove an oxide film according to conventional arts is subjected to handling. When the silicon wafer in which particles attach to the wafer surface as described above is used for manufacturing a semiconductor device, the wafer can become a cause for device failure.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0050">It seems a cause for particle generation that a handling jig and the like are in contact with the oxide film on a peripheral portion of a back surface of the wafer to break the oxide film partially and bring about particle generation. In this case, the problem of particle generation will be solved when a diameter of a spacer is made smaller and the oxide film is removed over the region including a flat portion of a back surface in the above mentioned method in which the wafer is immersed in hydrofluoric acid. However, when this method is attempted, there occurs a new problem that resistivity of an epitaxial layer decreases due to autodoping in which impurities are introduced into the epitaxial layer from the back surface of the wafer exposed as a result of removal of the oxide film. Moreover, recently, in order to improve the device yield, a wafer peripheral region where the flatness has not been required so far (edge exclusion) is gradually becoming narrow, so that it is becoming unable to be ignored an influence on the wafer flatness by complete removal of the oxide film in the region of the peripheral portion. Moreover, there is an essential problem in the method in which a wafer is immersed in hydrofluoric acid that more steps are required for the method, so that the productivity decreases remarkably as compared with the removal of the oxide film by polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0051]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0052" num="0051">The present inventors have realized that as a method for solving the above-mentioned problem, an oxide film on a peripheral portion of a back surface of a wafer is polished over a given distance from the outermost peripheral portion of the back surface so that a thickness of the polished oxide film decreases from inside to outside of the wafer. And they have found that when the wafer is polished over at least 2 mm inside from the outermost peripheral portion, breakage of the oxide film in handling and particle generation caused thereby can be prevented. Furthermore, they have found that, by this method, because the oxide film on the peripheral portion of the back surface is not completely removed, differently from the case where the wafer is immersed in hydrofluoric acid, it becomes possible that the back surface of the wafer is not exposed, and decrease of resistivity due to autodoping can be prevented.

By making the thickness of the oxide film on the peripheral portion of the back surface decrease as described above, it becomes possible to remarkably reduce particle generation caused in wafer handling and to obtain the wafer in which particles do not attach to the wafer surface. Moreover, as the oxide film is only made thin without being removed, flatness of the peripheral portion of the wafer is not lowered, and decrease of resistivity due to autodoping during epitaxial growth is not brought about. Here, when the part where the thickness of the oxide film decreases is narrower than 2 mm, measured from the outermost peripheral portion of the back surface, there cannot be obtained a sufficient effect that particles' attaching is prevented.
