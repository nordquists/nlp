With this, the surface of the SiC substrate is further planarized compared to the surface of the SiC substrate after the Ar gas cluster irradiation. Incidentally, an acceleration voltage of the nitrogen gas clusters in the second planarization process is about 20 kV.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0061]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0062" num="0061">Subsequently, the nitrogen gas clusters are irradiated to the surface of the SIC substrate at an acceleration voltage, which is smaller than the acceleration voltage at the first planarization process, of, for example, 10 kV, as a third planarization process. With this, the surface of the SIC substrate is more planarized than the surface of the SIC substrate after the second planarization process. Specifically, when the acceleration voltage is reduced, impact energy of the gas clusters onto the surface of the SIC substrate is reduced. By using such gas clusters, the surface of the SIC substrate is more planarized.</div>

According to such a substrate processing method, the surface of the SiC substrate can be planarized because gas clusters having a relatively larger size can improve surface planarity to a greater degree than gas clusters having a smaller size.
