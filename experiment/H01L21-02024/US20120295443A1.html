<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor devices are fabricated by carrying out numerous operations such as film formation, exposure, etching, polishing, and cleaning on a substrate wafer such as a silicon wafer. In semiconductor device fabrication, large numbers of test wafers are used to monitor the state of each of these operations and investigate the conditions for the respective operations. The used test wafers are generally subjected to reclamation treatment for the purpose of reuse.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the reclamation of used semiconductor wafers, conventional practice has been to etch the used semiconductor wafer so as to remove any films present thereon, then to lap and/or grind the surface of the semiconductor wafer and subsequently planarize the wafer surface by chemical mechanical polishing, or to directly planarize the wafer surface by chemical mechanical polishing (see, for example, Patent Document 1). Semiconductor wafers may be repeatedly reclaimed and used until the thickness of the wafer falls below a given value. It is thus important to minimize the thickness of a semiconductor wafer removed during reclamation so as to increase the number of times that the wafer can be repeatedly reclaimed and used.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the method for reclaiming semiconductor wafers of the present embodiment, which is carried out for the reuse of used test wafers, after films such as metal films and dielectric films on the semiconductor wafer have been removed from a used test wafer, the surface of the semiconductor wafer is subjected to chemical mechanical polishing using a polishing composition. Removal of the films on the semiconductor wafer is effected by dry etching or wet etching until the surface of the semiconductor wafer emerges. The surface of the semiconductor wafer following such film removal is not planar, typically having steps of 100 to 2,000 nm in height. These steps are due to the presence of recessed features having widths of, for example, 1,000 Î¼m or less on the surface of the semiconductor wafer. In some cases, the cause of such steps is an intentional pattern that was formed by etching on a test wafer; in other cases, the steps are caused by unintentional scratches. The above-mentioned chemical mechanical polishing is carried out for the purpose of planarizing the surface of the semiconductor wafer following film removal, and more specifically for the purpose of reducing the height of steps on this surface to 20 nm or less.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The reclamation of semiconductor wafers is completed once the height of steps formed on the wafer surface due to causes such as those mentioned above has been reduced to a level that permits reuse of the semiconductor wafer. The height of the steps at the level permitting reuse of the semiconductor wafer varies with the reuse application, but is typically 30 nm or less, preferably 20 nm or less, and even more preferably 10 nm or less. The thickness of a semiconductor wafer required to be removed for reclamation depends on the initial height of the steps, and thus is not subject to any particular limitation, although it is typically 10,000 nm or less, preferably 5,000 nm or less, and more preferably 3,000 nm or less.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The polishing composition used herein includes at least a step eliminating agent that is adsorbed to the surface of a semiconductor wafer and acts to prevent etching of bottom portions of the steps on the wafer surface during polishing. Exemplary step eliminating agents include water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, and celluloses; and surfactants such as carboxylic acid surfactants, sulfonic acid surfactants, and phosphate ester surfactants. The water-soluble polymers and surfactants are preferably nonionic or anionic. Polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and hydroxyethyl cellulose are especially preferred as the step eliminating agent. An oxyalkylene polymer having one or more types of oxyalkylene units may be used as the step eliminating agent. The use of polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol is preferred.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Several of these water-soluble polymers and surfactants are known to be used in finish polishing compositions for silicon wafers. Although such water-soluble polymers and surfactants are employed for the purpose of reducing the very fine, nanometer-order surface roughness of silicon wafers or for improving the wettability thereof, they are not used to eliminate steps. Moreover, when a finish polishing composition is used in the reclamation method of the present the invention, the silicon wafer polishing rate is very low, as a result of which polishing must be carried out for a long time until the steps are eliminated, which is impractical. At the same time, because a high polishing rate is required in primary polishing within the silicon wafer fabrication process, such water-soluble polymers and surfactants that act to lower the polishing rate are not used in primary polishing compositions for silicon wafers.</div>

In this regard, using a polyvinyl alcohol having an average molecular weight of 1,000,000 or less is advantageous for obtaining a semiconductor wafer polishing rate by the polishing composition that is especially desirable for practical purposes.</div>

An example of a method for the cyclic use of the polishing composition is a method in which used polishing composition discharged from the polishing machine is recovered in a tank, and the recovered polishing composition is again fed to the polishing machine. When the polishing composition is cyclically used, the amount of used polishing composition to be treated as waste declines compared with use in a âcontinuous flow process without circulationâ, enabling environmental impact to be reduced.

In this case, owing to the action by the step eliminating agent that is adsorbed to the surface of the semiconductor wafer and suppresses the etching of bottom portions of the steps during polishing, portions of the steps other than the bottom portions, i.e., the top portions of the steps, are preferentially removed by polishing. As a result, the removal thickness by polishing required in order to reclaim a semiconductor wafer by planarizing the wafer surface can be made smaller. Specifically, it is possible to planarize the semiconductor wafer surface by polishing the surface to remove a thickness of not more than 20 times the height of the steps prior to polishing. Thus, when the height of the steps prior to polishing (initial steps) is 100 nm, the removal thickness by polishing required to planarize the surface of the semiconductor wafer is 2,000 nm or less.

The average primary particle sizes of the colloidal silicas shown in Table 1 were measured with a surface area measuring device available from Micromeritics under the trade name FlowSorb II 2300. The average molecular weights of the step eliminating agents shown in Table 1 are weight-average molecular weights. In the âBasic compoundâ column of Table 1, âPIZâ stands for piperazine, âTMAHâ stands for tetramethylammonium hydroxide, âKOHâ stands for potassium hydroxide, and âK<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>â stands for potassium carbonate. In the âStep eliminating agentâ column in Table 1, âPVAâ stands for polyvinyl alcohol, âHECâ stands for hydroxyethyl cellulose, âPOE-POPâ stands for polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol, and âPVPâ stands for polyvinyl pyrrolidone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">Using the respective polishing compositions prepared in Examples 1 to 18 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5, silicon wafers having initial steps with a height of 230 nm were polished under the conditions indicated in Table 2. Polishing was carried out until steps on the surface of the silicon wafer could no longer be observed on a differential interference contrast (DIC) map obtained using a surface defect detector âSP2â from KLA-Tencor Japan, Ltd. On a DIC map, only steps having a height exceeding 20 nm are observed. That is, at a step height obtained from polishing of 20 nm or below, it becomes impossible to find the steps on a DIC map. The removal thickness by polishing and the polishing time required until steps can no longer be observed are shown in the âEvaluationâ column in Table 1.</div>
