</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently polishing has been often used as means for surface processing of constituent materials of various electronic and electric products. In such polishing, surfaces of objects to be polished, such as substrates, are polished with abrasive particles dispersed in an aqueous liquid, namely, a polishing slurry. It is known that the amount of polishing at the time of polishing depends on the concentration of abrasive particles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A larger amount of abrasive particles in polishing increases the contact frequency between abrasive particles and the surface of the object to be polished, and so the abrasive particles cut away more substances from the surface of the object to be polished, thereby increasing polishing rates. Controlling the concentration of abrasive particles in polishing has been applied to polishing slurries with abrasive particles such as silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It is common technical knowledge that the concentration of abrasive particles in such a polishing slurry, i.e., polishing slurry concentration, is set at 10% by weight to 20% by weight to carry out polishing. It has also been proposed that even in the case of polishing with, for example, manganese oxide as abrasive particles, the polishing slurry concentration is set at 10% by weight to 20% by weight (See Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, silicon carbide (SiC) has been attracting attention as a substrate material for power electronics semiconductors and white LEDs, and silicon carbide is known to be difficult to be machined due to its extremely high hardness. Given that, silicon carbide is polished with silicon oxide abrasive particles having excellent polishing properties. However, although the surface that has been polished has high surface accuracy, the polishing rate is low, and it is said that efficient polishing is difficult. Thus at present there is a strong demand for polishing technique capable of rapidly polishing even difficult-to-machine materials such as silicon carbide while achieving desired surface accuracy.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made under the above circumstances and provides a polishing technique capable of increasing polishing rates in polishing with a polishing slurry in which manganese oxide is used as abrasive particles. An object of the present invention is to provide a polishing technique capable of polishing, in particular, an object to be polished having high hardness and difficult to be machined, such as silicon carbide (SiC), at high polishing rates with good surface accuracy.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0006">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventors have conducted intensive studies on a polishing slurry prepared by dispersing manganese oxide in an aqueous liquid as abrasive particles, and have found that even at low concentration of abrasive particles, the polishing rate can be increased by chemical properties of the abrasive particles, and thus have accomplished the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to a polishing slurry for polishing a substrate, which comprises abrasive particles containing manganese oxide as a main component and in which the content of the abrasive particles is less than 10% by weight based on the polishing slurry. Although the content of the abrasive particles in the polishing slurry of the present invention is as low as less than 10% by weight, when manganese oxide is used as abrasive particles, the polishing rate is high and polishing offers a smooth polishing surface. The present invention is capable of forming a polishing surface having good surface accuracy at high polishing rates even at a polishing particle concentration lower than that of a conventional polishing slurry containing silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). The polishing slurry of the present invention enables polishing of an object to be polished having high hardness and difficult to be machined, such as silicon carbide (SiC), at high polishing rates with good surface accuracy. In the present invention, abrasive particles containing manganese oxide as a main component mean that abrasive particles contain 90% by weight or more of manganese oxide.</div>

The lower limit of the content is 0.1% by weight or more. This is because when the content is less than 0.1% by weight, the polishing rate is low and practical polishing is difficult. The content of the abrasive particles is more preferably 0.5% by weight to 5% by weight. The aqueous liquid in the polishing slurry of the present invention means water or a mixture of water and at least one organic solvent soluble in water mixed within the soluble range, containing at least 1% of water. Examples of organic solvents include alcohol and ketone.</div>

The upper limit of pH is 13. When the pH is more than 13, chemical properties of abrasive particles begin to change, that is, action of etching of silicon carbide due to manganese oxide begins, and the polishing surface is more likely to be roughened. The pH is preferably 7 to 12. When adjusting the pH, chemicals for that are not particularly limited. To suppress the negative effect on the object to be polished, however, potassium salts and ammonium salts are preferably used, and potassium salts are more preferably used.</div>

The silicon carbide single crystal substrates which were the object to be polished were SiC single crystal (6H structure) of 2 inches in diameter and 330 μm in thickness. The polishing surface was on axis (the wafer surface cut perpendicularly to the crystal axis). Before polishing, the average surface roughness in a 10 μm×10 μm area of the surface to be polished of the substrate was measured with AFM (Atomic force microscopy: NanoScope IIIa made by Veeco Instruments Inc.).

After the polishing, the polishing surface was washed with water to remove slurry attached and dried. The surface roughness of the dried polishing surface was measured at 5 random points by AFM.

For example, a polishing slurry containing 5% by weight of MnO<sub>2 </sub>and having a pH of 12.3 had a polishing rate similar to that of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>polishing slurry at a concentration of 20% by weight (see Table 1, Comparative Example 9).
