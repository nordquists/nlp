</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Crystal substrates are generally manufactured by slicing a crystal body grown in any of various ways. Regarding how to slice the crystal body, methods of slicing by means of various saw wires have been proposed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-233356 discloses a method of cutting a workpiece by means of a saw wire including a wire having a tensile strength of 3200 to 4200 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>and an average hardness of 730 to 900 Hv, with the aim of reducing waviness of a cut plane of the cut workpiece. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-328188 discloses a steel wire to be used for a wire saw with the aim of improving properties of a cut plane of a work (workpiece). The whole length of the steel wire exhibits a curl size (diameter) (herein refers to the size (diameter) of a loop which is formed naturally by the wire when the wire is put on a flat glass plate which is placed horizontally) of 320 mm or more, and the wire has a tensile strength of 2500 MPa or more and a diameter of 0.05 to 0.2 mm. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-080442 discloses a steel wire rod in which the concentration of sulfur is 0.0005 to 0.020% by mass and the sum of respective ratios of areas occupied respectively by pro-eitectoid cementite and martensite to the structure is 5% or less, with the aim of providing an ultrathin steel wire which is excellent in wire-drawability. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2005-111653 discloses a saw wire having an out-of-roundness of 0.8 μm or less with the aim of obtaining a cut product which is excellent in precision of a sliced plane. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-087285 discloses a plated steel wire to be used for a wire saw that has one or more plate layers on the steel wire, with the aim of improving surface properties of a cut product.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2006-190909 discloses that, in order to reduce the rate of occurrence of cracks when an ingot of a hexagonal group III nitride crystal is cut, the direction in which a wire is extended when the ingot is cut with the wire is inclined by 3° or more relative to the {1-100} plane of the ingot.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">A group III nitride crystal body such as GaN crystal body is generally low in terms of the crystal growth rate and complicated in terms of the manufacture process, and is therefore very expensive. In order to obtain a greater number of group III nitride crystal substrates from such an expensive group III nitride crystal body, it is necessary to reduce the kerf loss (material loss during a cutting process). When a conventional saw wire is used to slice a group III nitride crystal body into thin pieces, a resultant problem is that cracks are likely to open and the yield of group III nitride crystal substrates is low. Thus, there has been a demand for a saw wire thinner than conventional ones.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">A group III nitride crystal body with a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure has its polarity along the &lt;0001&gt; direction, and its Ga-atom surface which is a (0001) plane and its N-atom surface which is a (000-1) plane have respective hardnesses different from each other. Due to this, when the group III nitride crystal body is sliced along planes parallel with the (0001) plane and the (000-1) plane to obtain a group III nitride crystal substrate whose main surfaces are Ga-atom surface and N-atom surface, warpage occurs to the main surfaces. In order to reduce this warpage, the tension applied to the saw wire when the group III nitride crystal body is sliced (this tension is hereinafter referred to as stretch tension) should be higher than 8 N, preferably higher than 10 N. An increased tension (stretch tension) applied to the saw wire results in a problem of an increased probability of wire breakage during a slicing process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Regarding a conventional saw wire like those disclosed in the above-referenced patent literatures, which is for example a saw wire having SWRS82A defined by the JIS G3502:2004 as a steel material for the wire and having a diameter of 0.08 mm, an applied tension of 10 N or more causes the probability of wire breakage during a slicing process to increase. It has thus been difficult to slice a group III nitride crystal body with safety and with a high yield.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a saw wire <b>22</b> in an embodiment of the present invention includes a steel wire having a carbon concentration of not less than 0.90 mass % and not more than 0.95 mass %, a silicon concentration of not less than 0.12 mass % and not more than 0.32 mass %, a manganese concentration of not less than 0.40 mass % and not more than 0.90 mass %, a phosphorus concentration of not more than 0.025 mass %, a sulfur concentration of not more than 0.025 mass %, and a copper concentration of not more than 0.20 mass %. Saw wire <b>22</b> of the present embodiment includes the above-described steel wire, and therefore, the saw wire has a high tensile strength at break and a high tension can be applied thereto without breaking the wire even if the wire is a thin wire of a small diameter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The steel wire included in saw wire <b>22</b> of the present embodiment has the following chemical components in order to have a high tensile strength at break. Carbon is an element that is effective in ensuring the tensile strength at break. If the carbon concentration is lower than 0.90 mass %, it is difficult to give high strength to the steel wire. If the carbon concentration is higher than 0.95 mass %, the steel wire is hard and brittle. Silicon is an element that is effective in deoxidation (herein refers to reduction of the oxygen content in the steel wire). If the silicon concentration is lower than 0.12 mass %, silicon is less effective in its function. If the silicon concentration is higher than 0.32 mass %, a decarburized layer (herein refers to a layer generated when the steel is heated in an acidic atmosphere and reaction of carbon in the steel with oxygen in the acidic atmosphere causes carbon to be removed from the surface layer of the steel, and this decarburized layer has a deteriorated strength and a significantly deteriorated antifatigue strength) is partially generated to deteriorate the antifatigue property of the steel wire. Manganese has, in addition to the above-described deoxidizing function, a function of enhancing the wire drawability by fixing sulfur in the steel wire, in the form of MnS which is a sulfide inclusion. If the manganese concentration is lower than 0.40 mass %, manganese is less effective in terms of the above-described functions. If the manganese concentration is higher than 0.90 mass %, the content of the sulfide inclusion is higher and the wire is more likely to be broken in a wire-drawing process and segregation of manganese may cause cuppy breakage (herein refers to a V-shaped crack breakage occurring within the material). Phosphorus deteriorates the wire drawability. Therefore, the phosphorus concentration is not more than 0.025 mass %. While sulfur may not be present, sulfur, if present, has a function of enhancing the wire drawability by forming a sulfide inclusion. If the sulfur concentration is higher than 0.025 mass %, the content of the sulfide inclusion is higher to cause deterioration of the wire drawability. While copper may not be present, copper, if present, has a function of enhancing the corrosion resistance. If the copper concentration is higher than 0.20 mass %, it segregates at the grain boundary and crack or flaw is likely to occur in a hot process such as hot rolling of the wire rod.</div>

Accordingly, the yield of group III nitride crystal substrates is improved. Furthermore, since the wire diameter is not less than 0.07 mm, the tension at break of the wire is increased.
