</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, in order to achieve a higher breakdown voltage and lower loss of a semiconductor device, use thereof in an environment at high temperature and the like, silicon carbide has increasingly been adopted as a material for forming a semiconductor device. Silicon carbide is a wide band-gap semiconductor greater in band gap than silicon conventionally widely used as a material for forming a semiconductor device. Therefore, by adopting silicon carbide as a material for forming a semiconductor device, a higher breakdown voltage, a lower ON resistance of a semiconductor device and the like can be achieved. In addition, a semiconductor device adopting silicon carbide as a material is also more advantageous than a semiconductor device adopting silicon as a material in that deterioration in its characteristics at the time when it is used in an environment at high temperature is less.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A semiconductor device including silicon carbide as a material is manufactured, for example, by forming an epitaxial growth layer on a silicon carbide substrate, fabricating a region therein, in which a desired impurity has been introduced, and forming an electrode. Here, in order to form a high-quality epitaxial growth layer, a silicon carbide substrate uniform in plane orientation at a main surface should be used. To that end, for example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-294499 has proposed obtaining of a silicon carbide substrate uniform in plane orientation at a main surface by controlling a temperature condition during crystal growth or a crystal shape, and the like.</div>

Though warpage of the substrate can be lessened by surface polishing or the like, planarization of a surface of the substrate great in warpage by polishing or the like will cause variation in plane orientation at the polished main surface.</div>

In the step of obtaining a substrate, the ingot is sliced such that cutting proceeds in a direction in which an angle formed with respect to a &lt;11-20&gt; direction or a &lt;1-100&gt; direction is 15±5° in an orthogonal projection on a {0001} plane. In the step of polishing a surface of the substrate, at least one main surface of the substrate is polished while the entire surface of the at least one main surface of the substrate is in contact with a polishing surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Here, a state where the entire main surface of the substrate is in contact with the polishing surface means such a state that the main surface of the substrate is in contact with the polishing surface substantially over the entire region as a result of correction of warpage or waving of the substrate, and it encompasses not only such a state that the entire main surface of the substrate is completely in contact with the polishing surface in all regions but also such a state that a part of the main surface of the substrate is distant from the polishing surface. In addition, the polishing surface refers to a surface at which polishing proceeds with the surface being in contact with the main surface of the substrate, and for example, to a surface of a grindstone, a surface of a surface plate, or the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventor has conducted detailed studies about approaches for suppressing warpage and variation in plane orientation at the main surface of the substrate composed of silicon carbide. Consequently, firstly, the present inventor has found that warpage of the substrate is suppressed by causing slicing to proceed in a direction at a certain angle with respect to a direction of cleavage of crystal of silicon carbide in a phase of cutting an ingot composed of single crystal silicon carbide. If a substrate where warpage still remains is polished without any measures being taken, however, polishing proceeds while a state of curving of a crystal plane is maintained and hence variation in plane orientation at the polished main surface is caused. In contrast, the studies conducted by the present inventor have revealed that warpage of the substrate can further be lessened with variation in plane orientation at at least one main surface being suppressed, by polishing the substrate while the entire surface of at least one main surface of the substrate is in contact with the polishing surface.</div>

Then, the obtained substrate is polished while the entire surface of at least one main surface is in contact with the polishing surface. Therefore, warpage of the substrate can further be lessened while variation in plane orientation at at least one main surface of the substrate is suppressed.

Firstly, a method of manufacturing a silicon carbide substrate according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the method of manufacturing a silicon carbide substrate according to the present embodiment, initially, as a step (S<b>10</b>), an ingot preparation step is performed. In this step (S<b>10</b>), for example with a sublimation method described below, an ingot composed of single crystal silicon carbide and having a diameter not smaller than 2 inches is fabricated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">Initially, a seed crystal composed of single crystal silicon carbide and source material powders composed of silicon carbide are placed in a container composed of graphite. Then, silicon carbide sublimates as the source material powders are heated and silicon carbide is recrystallized on the seed crystal. Here, recrystallization proceeds while a desired impurity such as nitrogen is being introduced. Thus, an ingot <b>1</b> composed of single crystal silicon carbide is obtained as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It is noted that, by setting a direction of growth of ingot <b>1</b> to the &lt;0001&gt; direction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ingot <b>1</b> can efficiently be fabricated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">Then, as a step (S<b>20</b>), a cutting step is performed. In this step (S<b>20</b>), referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a silicon carbide substrate <b>10</b> is obtained by slicing fabricated ingot <b>1</b>. Specifically, initially, ingot <b>1</b> is set such that a part of a side surface thereof is supported by a support base <b>2</b>. Then, a wire <b>9</b> comes closer to ingot <b>1</b> along a cutting direction a which is a direction perpendicular to a direction of running while the wire runs in a direction along a direction of a diameter of ingot <b>1</b>, so that wire <b>9</b> and ingot <b>1</b> come in contact with each other. Then, as wire <b>9</b> continues to move along cutting direction α, ingot <b>1</b> is cut.</div>

Specifically, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an angle β formed between the &lt;11-20&gt; direction of ingot <b>1</b> and cutting direction α is set to 15°±5°. Thus, influence on wire <b>9</b> by the cleavage direction is lessened and warpage of silicon carbide substrate <b>10</b> is suppressed.
