<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Nowadays, in semiconductor industry, the feature linewidth of ultra-large scale integrate circuit (ULSI) has been down to 120 nm and the diameter of wafer has been up to 300 mm. Feature linewidth lower than 100 nm is coming into market. The number of transistors on a single chip has broken through 10<sup>8</sup>. According to the development blueprint of the Semiconductor Industry Association of USA, the feature linewidth of microelectronics will be down to 50 nm, the wafer diameter will be up to 450 mm by 2011, and the metal layers of ULSI will be developed from 5-6 toward larger than 5-6. At present, the International Semiconductor Industry Association considers that the globe planarization of the wafer has to be performed when the feature size is down to 350 nm or less in order to ensure the precision and resolution of lithography. Planarization and polishing will become a key technique and play a crucial role in the development of the ULSI manufacture.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The precondition of USLI manufacture is that a substrate such as silicon wafer has to subject to the planarization and polishing of the surface and then is used. With the feature size of a device decreasing down to nanometer size, the requirements of surface quality, especially the surface planeness and mechanical damage of the silicon wafer become higher and higher while the resolution and the focusing depth of lithography have more and more limitation. Thus, the wafer with large size surface should have a surface with a profile precision of nanometer and a surface roughness of sub-nanometer. Meantime, the wafer should have a surface and subsurface without stresses and damages. Furthermore, each layer has to be planarized globally during the construction of the multi-layer wiring of ULSI. With the development of ULSI in the miniaturization of feature linewidth, three-dimensional constructions and multi-layer wiring, RC delay affects the performance of devices. In order to eliminate the RC delay, multi-layer high frequency metal interconnection structures have to be constructed. During the construction, if any layer constructing the device is too high in surface roughness, the device will have an increasing noise and poor uniformity of the electrical property, which will reduce frequency characteristic of the device and thereby reduce the integrated level, reliability and high quality product of ULSI. Thus, each layer for the device must be globally planarized, i.e., it is required to provide the removement and planarization of the excess deposition of copper (Cu) interconnectors of multiple wirings and of the dielectric layer such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiOF and other layer with superlow k having concavo and convex, which is a key step to achieve three dimensional structure of the ULSI. Moreover, as the feature size is further down, the adverse effect caused by diffusion of metal Cu into the SiO<sub>2 </sub>insulating layer will tend to be severe. It is an efficient way to provide a diffusion barrier layer or a porous delectric material with superlow k (insulator) in order to solve above technical problem. Moreover, Ta or TaN are considered a desirable metal material for the barrier layer due to their excellent adhesiveness to Cu and thermostability. However, the deposition of Ta or TaN onto the microcircuit board is non-selective. That means the insulator SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer will be covered totally. Thus, the unwanted Ta or TaN depositions have to be removed out of the Cu wire casing. Since Ta is a hard metal and is harder when oxidized, how to remove and planarize the unwanted Ta or TaN depositions will be another key technique for the globe planarization for the future ULSI manufacture. Moreover, how to planarize the fragile or flexible porous low-k dielectric material still remains great challenge. In summary, developing a multifunctional planarization and polishing method in nano-precision applied to metal, semiconductor and insulator at the same time is a common and key technique for the industrial manufacture of ULSI, which is recognized by all the countries all over the world.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the most effective technology and the only way to achieve the submicron size global planarization. CMP is a process of smoothing surfaces with the combination of chemical and mechanical forces, i.e., the oxidizers, catalysts and the like existed in the polishing slurry react with the surface atoms of the workpiece to form an oxide film on the workpiece surface, which is removed through mechanical friction by the abrasive grains suspended in the polishing slurry; the resulted fresh surface of the workpiece continues to be oxidized; thus, with the alternative oxidization and polishing, the workpiece surface is polished and planarized. However, due to the nonuniformity of mechanical friction and external force, the roughness after polishing still remains high, which will affect directly on the subsequent processes and also the finished product ratio. The most frequently used abrasive grains, e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particles, are hard and dispersed in the viscous slurry, which is easy to cause surface damages, even deep surface damages. Furthermore, there exist many other problems such as metal ion contaminations to workpiece surface, poor dispersion of abrasive grains in the slurry, and low removal rate in alkaline environment. During application of the CPM technology, another important issue is to determine and control the end points for the planishing-polishing method, i.e. it is difficult to determine when the desired amount of material has been removed or the desired degree of planarization has been obtained. If the oxide layer has been overly thinned and/or the desired degree of planarity has not been obtained during this process, the sequence process would be further done. More importantly, the future ULSI manufacture requires the wafer of having a profile precision of nanometer and a surface roughness of sub-nanometer, which is beyond the limit of CMP (in a 20 mm×20 mm area Ra&lt;20 nm). Although, in recent years, assistant means of electrochemistry has be applied to CMP, where anodic dissolution is employed so as to improve the effects on polishing and planarization of copper or other semiconductor material. Unfortunately, the above mentioned disadvantages for CMP are not completely eliminated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, there are two development tendencies for the manufacture of modern precision optical devices: the micro-optical elements (MOC) and large dimensional ultra-precise optical devices. MOC is the optical element constructed by freeform optical surface with microstructure which has a profile precision of micrometer and a surface roughness of sub-nanometer, typically it includes the holographic lens, diffractive optical elements, GRIN-rod lens and so forth. With the tendency of miniaturization, MOC has prospective application into the science and technology of both national defense and civil industrial domains. Large dimensional ultra-precise optical devices are also important. For example, it may use as the huge lens and reflecting mirrors of space telescopes and the large dimensional high precise optical glass elements in laser fusion devices, which should have a surface roughness Ra of less than 1 nm in the high-frequency section. The polishing method for the ultra-precision optical devices is also dependent on CMP. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new planarization and polishing method which may avoid the disadvantages of CMP and, at meantime time, may achieve a profile precision of nanometer and a surface roughness of sub-nanometer.</div>

That is, through the photo/electrochemical means, a confined etchant and/or leveling agent layer having a thickness of nanometer scale is formed on the surface of the tool electrode with nano-planeness; the etchant reacts with and remove a workpiece material until the profile precision and surface roughness of the workpiece surface reach a precision of nanometer scale; thereby the workpiece achieves the desirable polishing and planishing treatment. The basic principle of CELT is described as followed:</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">(1) Through the electrochemical, photochemical or photoelectrochemical means, i.e. the suitable parameters such as potential or/and light wavelength and intensity is choosed based on chemical characteristics of the confined etching system, the precursors of etchant will be reacted to form etchant on the surface of tool electrode through the photo/electrochemical means. The etchant can be either a conventional chemicals or chemical radicals. The etchant generation reaction presented on the surface of the tool electrode can be expressed as:</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0000"> <br/>R→O+ne or R+hν→O (+ne)   (1)
</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0000">where, R is the precursor of etchant and O is the generated etchant.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0034">(2) The scavenger contained in the working electrolyte solution will react with the etchant in the vicinity of tool electrode surface to compact the etchant layer to a thickness of nanometer scale. If the generated etchant is a chemical radical, the thickness of the etchant layer can be compact through either the scavenger or spontaneous decay of the radical itself. The scavenging reaction can be expressed as:</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0000"> <br/>O+S→R+Y or O→Y   (2)
</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0000">where, S is the scavenger and Y is product by a reaction between the etchant O and the scavenger or by the decay of the etchant O itself. The thickness of confined etchant layer depends on the reaction rate of reaction (1) and (2), and the concentration ratio of between the etchant precursor and the scavenger. If the concentration of the scavenger is pretty higher than that of the etchant precursor, a limited thickness of the confined etchant layer can be estimated by the following equation:</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0000"> <br/>μ=(<i>k</i> <sub>2</sub> <i>/D</i> <sub>R</sub>)<sup>1/2 </sup>  (3)

In the practical etching process, the thickness of confined etchant layer can be adjusted by changing the concentration ratio of between the etchant precursor and the scavenger, i.e., the precision of polishing and polarization can be tunable. Although the thickness of a confined etchant layer is at nanometer scale, the concentration distribution of etchant keeps constant inside the confined etchant layer.</div>

The removal rate of the workpiece surface is determined by a rate of the etching reaction (3). Once the surface parts of workpiece contacting with the confined etchant layer are removed, the workpiece will separate from the confined etchant layer. Consequently, the polishing and planarization process stops.

The described “limiting diffusion potential” means under this potential the photo/electrochemical current keeps a constant maximum.

For example, when at least one selected from the group consisting of ferrocene and its derivatives, persulfate, dissolved oxygen, bromide, fluoride, and alkylamine is used as etchant precursor, the concentration of etchant precursor is usually controlled in a range from 0.001 to 1.0 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>.

Consequently, the lifetime of the etchant and/or leveling agent will be shortened due to the fast scavenging reaction. Since their lifetime is very short, the etchant and/or leveling agents can't diffuse too far away from the tool electrode surface and would form a confined etchant liquid layer having a thickness of nanometer scale. That means the polishing and planarization can be processed with an extremely high resolution. Moreover, due to the existence of confined etchant liquid layer between the tool electrode and the workpiece, the tool electrode does not actually contact the surface of the workpiece and thereby keeps its surface retaining the nano-precise planeness.</div>

The free radical etchant is produced through photo/electrochemical reaction on the surface of tool electrode and etches the workpiece surface.

Due to the scavenger which is added to the solution in advance can react quickly with the etchant and/or leveling agent, the life time of the etchant and/or leveling agent is dramatically shortened. That means the etchant and/or leveling agent cannot diffuse far away from the surface of tool electrode <b>21</b>. The thickness of the formed “confined etchant layer” can be confined to nanometer scale (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>b, </i>where the reference number <b>24</b> is the plating layer, and the reference number <b>25</b> is the dielectric layer). The polishing and planarization will be in process once the confined etchant and leveling layer on the tool electrode surface contacts with the workpiece surface. With the etching reaction going on, the workpiece surface will separated from the confined etchant layer. So, in order to ensure that the confined etchant and leveling layer may sequentially contact with the workpiece surface and achieve the desirable etching degree, the automated control system will keep feeding the tool electrode toward the workpiece until the polishing and planarization is finished (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>c</i>). Since the confined etchant layer is very thin, i.e. has a thickness of no more than 20 nm, and has a stable concentration distribution, it keeps the planeness of the surface of tool electrode. When the etching process is done, the workpiece surface will have the same nano-precise planeness as that of the tool electrode (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>d</i>).</div>

Thus, the process of polishing and planarization was started and the surface of the Cu workpiece was gradually removed with time going on. The automatic operation system constantly made the tool electrode feed and thereby made the chemical reaction for the polishing and planishing be continued. During the process, the workpiece was rotating at low speed (1 rmp) in a ultra-steady state, and the confined etchant Layer (thickness≦50 nm) was inside the laminar layer. Therefore, the relative motion between the tool electrode and the workpiece has no impact on the planeness of the confined etchant layer surface. Processing time depended on the removal rate which was relevant to both the workpiece material and confined etching system. In the case of planarization and polishing process of Cu workpiece, feeding time of the tool electrode lasted 15 min. After that, the automatic operation system was cut off and the feeding of the tool electrode was stopped. 5 minutes later, the electrochemical system was turned off and the tool electrode is withdrawn.
