<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for polishing a silicon wafer and a polishing solution for the method. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for polishing a silicon wafer and a polishing solution for the method in which the silicon wafer and a polishing cloth are rotated relative to each other while the polishing solution is supplied to polish at least a front surface of the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer as a polished surface, the polishing solution containing free abrasive grains in an alkaline aqueous solution.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, CMP (chemical-mechanical polishing) has been common as a method for polishing a front surface of a silicon wafer. CMP is performed by rotating the silicon wafer and a polishing cloth relative to each other while supplying a polishing solution, in which an alkaline aqueous solution contains free abrasive grains such as silica grains. CMP is known for obtaining a high degree of flatness for a front surface of the silicon wafer by combining a mechanical polishing effect from the free abrasive grains with a chemical polishing effect from the alkaline aqueous solution. In the CMP process for the silicon wafer, typically, polishing is performed through a plurality of steps, from rough polishing to finish polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Rough polishing, the earliest step, seeks to polish the silicon wafer to a desired thickness. A polishing cloth of a hard material such as hardened urethane resin is used with a comparatively high polishing speed to polish the silicon wafer so as to reduce and flatten variations in the thickness of the silicon wafer after polishing. In the rough polishing operation, the polishing process may be performed while breaking the polishing amount (stock amount) of the silicon wafer into a plurality of stages (e.g., stages one to three) and changing the type of polishing cloth and the size of the free abrasive grains. Finish polishing, the last step, is performed to remedy roughness on the front surface of the silicon wafer. A pliant polishing cloth such as suede is used with minute free abrasive grains to polish the silicon wafer so as to reduce minute variations in surface roughness such as micro-roughness and haze on the front surface of the silicon wafer. Similar to the rough polishing operation, the finish polishing operation may be broken into a plurality of stages while changing the type of polishing cloth and the size of the free abrasive grains.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">From the perspective of device miniaturization in recent years and expanding a range of device forms for the silicon wafer, a high degree of flatness is required even in a vicinity of the outermost periphery of the silicon wafer, thus heightening concern for flatness in the vicinity of the outermost periphery and a surface deformation amount of the wafer. Accordingly, in order to evaluate a shape of the outermost periphery of the silicon wafer, an index called ROA (Roll-Off Amount) is known which quantitatively expresses an amount of drop and an amount of rise on the outer periphery of the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">An imaginary standard flat surface is obtained from a wafer shape, for example, at a position (reference area) 124 mm-135 mm from the center of a silicon wafer having a diameter of 300 mm that is believed to be flat. ROA 1 mm, for example, is then defined as a distance to a position 1 mm from an outer edge of the wafer toward an interior. At this point, a height of the standard flat surface is defined as 0. When a shape up to the outer edge of the wafer drops below this, an amount of displacement has a −value (roll-off). When a shape rises instead, the amount of displacement has a +value (roll-up). In addition, the smaller the absolute value of the roll-off and roll-up, the higher the degree of flatness is evaluated to be, even at the outermost periphery.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The amount of polishing the silicon wafer receives in the rough polishing operation is typically greater than in the finish polishing operation. Thus, viscoelasticity of the polishing cloth has a large effect and there is a negative circumstance in which the outer periphery of the wafer may be excessively polished, which may cause roll-off to develop in the silicon wafer after rough polishing. Therefore, in the invention recited in Related Art 1, for example, a method for double surface polishing is suggested in which a carrier plate having a thickness greater than the thickness of the silicon wafer before polishing is used. The silicon wafer is accommodated within the carrier plate, then the carrier plate is sandwiched between an upper platen and a lower platen to which polishing cloths have been adhered. In this state, the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer are simultaneously polished.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">When polishing the front and back surfaces of the silicon wafer so as to achieve a wafer thickness equal to or less than the thickness of the carrier plate, the carrier plate inhibits the polishing of the outer periphery of the wafer by the polishing cloths. Thus, the amount of roll-off that develops is indeed reduced. However, in the invention recited in Related Art 1, when the carrier plate presses into the polishing cloth, the polishing cloth is lifted up in a portion positioned at a wafer holding aperture of the carrier plate (i.e., at the wafer held in the wafer holding aperture). The lifted polishing cloth makes strong contact with the outer periphery of the wafer, and as a result the outer periphery of the wafer is polished. Therefore, the advantageous effect of reducing roll-off is insufficient. Additional issues include the carrier plate itself being polished, thus increasing a replacement frequency for the carrier plate and causing production costs to rise, or the carrier plate vibrating due to being polished, thus causing the silicon wafer to jump out of the carrier plate during the polishing process.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">A method for polishing a silicon wafer in the present invention is a method for polishing a silicon wafer in which the silicon wafer and a hard polishing cloth are rotated relative to each other while a polishing solution is supplied to the polishing cloth to rough polish a polished surface of the silicon wafer, the polishing solution having a water-soluble polymer added to an alkaline aqueous solution containing free abrasive grains.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the method for polishing the silicon wafer in the present invention, due to an etching effect from the alkaline aqueous solution, an abrasion effect from the free abrasive grains, and an etching inhibition effect on an outer periphery of the silicon wafer from the water-soluble polymer, roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer can be prevented while maintaining a high polishing rate. In addition, conventional polishing methods use a polishing solution in which no water-soluble polymer is present despite including the free abrasive grains. As the polishing progresses, roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer is promoted. In contrast, in the case of the present invention, due to the etching inhibition effect on the outer periphery of the silicon wafer from the water-soluble polymer described above, by having a long polishing time and increasing a polishing amount, for example, the outer periphery of the wafer can be made to have a roll-up shape. Thus, assuming roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer during finish polishing, for example, an ideal flat shape can be achieved for the outer periphery of the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the reason that roll-off is prevented (decreased) is conjectured to be due to an occurrence of a phenomenon described below. During the polishing process, the water-soluble polymer in the polishing solution is adsorbed into the front surface of the silicon wafer and the front surface of the wafer becomes coated by the water-soluble polymer. The free abrasive grains in the polishing solution receive pressure from the polishing cloth (rotation of the polishing platens) and pressure from the silicon wafer (rotation of the silicon wafer). Thereby, the free abrasive grains actively flow and make contact with the wafer, then flow to an exterior of the polished surface while adsorbing the polymer film formed on the polished surface (surface to be polished) of the silicon wafer. The polished surface from which the polymer film has been stripped is reactive, and thus is chemically etched by the alkaline aqueous solution. Polishing is believed to be advanced through repetition of this adsorption of the water-soluble polymer, stripping of the polymer layer, alkali etching, and abrasion from the free abrasive grains. Meanwhile, the water-soluble polymer adheres to an edge (chamfered portion) of the unpolished silicon wafer, as well. However, the probability is extremely low that the polymer film adsorbed to this portion will be stripped by the free abrasive grains. The etching reaction on the outer periphery of the wafer is inhibited by the water-soluble polymer film adsorbed to the edge of the silicon wafer, and the amount of roll-off is theorized to be reduced thereby.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">In the method for polishing the silicon wafer in the present invention, the alkaline aqueous solution containing the free abrasive grains is used as the polishing solution. Herein, “the alkaline aqueous solution containing the free abrasive grains” means a polishing solution in which, for example, free abrasive grains such as colloidal silica (abrasive grains), diamond abrasive grains, and alumina abrasive grains are mixed into the alkaline aqueous solution which is the chief component of the polishing solution. By including the free abrasive grains, the polymer film adhered to the polished surface can be effectively stripped and the etching effect from the alkaline aqueous solution on the front surface of the silicon wafer can be heightened. In addition, a natural oxide film of around 5-20 Å is typically present on the front surface of the silicon wafer before the rough polishing operation due to an early stage cleaning process or exposure to a highly pure atmosphere. However, by including the free abrasive grains, rough polishing can be performed while stripping the oxide film. Therefore, there is no need to include an operation to strip the oxide film with an etching process using a chemical solution such as hydrofluoric acid. Moreover, the average particle size of the free abrasive grains used is preferably 30-200 nm. Use of free abrasive grains with an average particle size of 50-150 nm is particularly preferred. At an average particle size of less than 30 nm, the abrasive grains aggregate and processing-induced defects such as micro-scratches are likely to be triggered. At more than 200 nm, colloidal dispersion becomes difficult and variations in concentration arise.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">The content amount of the alkaline agent in the alkaline aqueous solution is 100-1000 ppm. At less than 100 ppm, the etching force of the alkaline agent on the front surface of the silicon wafer is insufficient and a long period of time is required to polish the silicon wafer to a desired thickness. At more than 1000 ppm, handling of the polishing solution itself becomes difficult and surface roughness becomes more likely to develop on the front surface of the wafer due to an excessive etching reaction. An alkaline aqueous solution to which any of a basic ammonium salt, a basic potassium salt, and a basic sodium salt has been added; an alkaline carbonate aqueous solution; or an alkaline aqueous solution to which amine has been added, for example, are the alkaline agent (pH adjusting agent) of the alkaline aqueous solution. In addition, a hydrazine or amine aqueous solution may be used. From the perspective of increasing the polishing rate, an alkali other than ammonia is preferred, and use of an amine is particularly preferred.</div>

Specifically, hydroxyethylcellulose or polyethylene glycol are preferably used as the water-soluble polymer. In particular, highly pure hydroxyethylcellulose can be obtained comparatively easily and readily forms the polymer film on the front surface of the wafer. Thus, the effect of inhibiting the etching reaction from the alkali is characteristically high. However, of the various kinds of water-soluble polymer, a water-soluble polymer that promotes the etching of the silicon wafer by the alkaline aqueous solution is unsuitable. One kind of the water-soluble polymer may be used, or a plurality of kinds may be used.</div>

A reduction in the amount of roll-off on the outer periphery of the silicon wafer can thus be achieved. Specifically, the polishing process is conducted with the silicon wafer pressed against the polishing cloth. Therefore, should a pliant polishing cloth be used, the silicon wafer will sink into the polishing cloth and a reactive force of the polishing cloth attempting to return to an original form has a large effect at the outer periphery of the wafer. The water-soluble polymer film adsorbed to the outer periphery of the silicon wafer is thus aggressively stripped away and roll-off is likely to develop. When a hard polishing cloth is used, recession into the polishing cloth is slight, and thus the water-soluble polymer adsorbed to the edge of the unpolished silicon wafer can be maintained while the water-soluble polymer adsorbed to the polished surface of the silicon wafer can be efficiently removed. A high polishing rate and large roll-off inhibition effect can thus be achieved simultaneously.</div>

At less than a Shore A hardness of 70, the polishing rate increases for a region up to 3 mm from the outer peripheral edge of the silicon wafer and roll off is likely to develop on the outer periphery of the wafer. When the Shore A hardness is more than 90, polishing flaws may become more likely to develop on the front surface of the wafer.</div>

Rotation directions of the silicon wafer and the polishing cloth are at the user's discretion. For example, when both the silicon wafer and the polishing cloth are rotated, the rotation direction of the two may be the same or different.

At less than 0.05 μm/minute, the polishing rate is low and polishing requires a long time. When greater than 1 μm/minute, surface roughness is likely to occur on the front surface of the silicon wafer due to an increased concentration of alkali and an increased additive rate of the free abrasive grains. The rotation speed of the silicon wafer, the rotation speed of the polishing cloth, polishing pressure, and the like may be set so as to be within the range for the polishing rate described above. For example, the rotation speed for each of the silicon wafer and the polishing cloth may be selected from within a range of 5-100 rpm, and the polishing pressure may be set within a range of 30-500 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the polishing amount in the rough polishing may be set in consideration of the desired thickness of the silicon wafer, and is set within an overall range of 1 μm-20 μm.

In particular, when rough polishing the front and rear surfaces of the wafer simultaneously, polishing is preferably performed using a double surface polishing device that includes a carrier plate accommodating the silicon wafer and an upper platen and lower platen to which polishing cloths have been adhered, on either side of the carrier plate. A high degree of flatness can thus be achieved for the rear surface of the wafer, not only the front surface of the wafer, in a single polishing process, which is effective in providing mirror-surfaced silicon wafers having a high degree of flatness at low cost.</div>

Moreover, during the polishing process, vibration of the silicon wafer and the carrier plate can be inhibited and the silicon wafer can be prevented from jumping out of the carrier plate.

A suede-type pad in which urethane resin has been foamed onto a substrate fabric composed of a non-woven fabric may be used as the finish polishing cloth. In addition, a polishing agent in which free abrasive grains having an average particle size of around 20-100 nm have been added to the alkaline solution may be used as the finish polishing agent. The amount of finish polishing for the rough-polished surface of the silicon wafer is 0.1 μm or more and less than 1 μm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">The polishing solution of the present invention is a polishing solution used during rough polishing of at least a front surface of the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer as the polished surface. The chief component of the polishing solution of the present invention is the alkaline aqueous solution containing the free abrasive grains, to which the water-soluble polymer has been added. With such a polishing solution, roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer can be prevented while maintaining a high polishing rate due to the etching effect of the alkaline aqueous solution, the abrasion effect of the free abrasive grains, and the etching inhibition effect of the water-soluble polymer on the outer periphery of the silicon wafer. In addition, conventional polishing methods use a polishing solution in which no water-soluble polymer is present despite including the free abrasive grains. As the polishing progresses, roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer is promoted. In contrast, in the case of the present invention, due to the etching inhibition effect of the water-soluble polymer on the outer periphery of the silicon wafer described above, by having a long polishing time and increasing the polishing amount, for example, the outer periphery of the wafer can be made to have a roll-up shape. Thus, assuming roll-off on the outer periphery of the wafer during finish polishing, for example, an ideal flat shape can be achieved for the outer periphery of the wafer.</div>

At more than 1000 ppm, handling of the polishing solution itself becomes difficult and surface roughness is likely to occur in the front surface of the wafer due to an excessive etching reaction. The alkaline aqueous solution is preferably an alkaline aqueous solution to which any of a basic ammonium salt, a basic potassium salt, and a basic sodium salt has been added as the alkaline agent; an alkaline carbonate aqueous solution; or an alkaline aqueous solution to which amine has been added. In addition, the water-soluble polymer is preferably one kind or several kinds among a non-ionic polymer and a monomer, or one kind or several kinds among an anionic polymer and a monomer. Thereby, processing-induced defects such as scratches and flaws do not develop in the front surface of the silicon wafer, handling of the polishing solution is easy, and a high polishing (etching) rate can be obtained for the silicon wafer.</div>

The first embodiment is configured so as to perform finish polishing after a first polishing, which is rough polishing. In the first polishing operation, the rough polishing is performed using a first polishing cloth and a polishing solution containing free abrasive grains and a water-soluble polymer. In the finish polishing operation, in order to achieve flattening of the silicon wafer, finish polishing is performed using a finish polishing cloth and a polishing solution containing free abrasive grains for finish polishing. A double surface-polished silicon wafer in which a front surface and a rear surface have been mirror polished is manufactured through each of the following operations. Specifically, a monocrystalline silicon ingot is pulled with the Czochralski method from a molten solution of silicon doped with a predetermined amount of boron in a crucible, the monocrystalline silicon ingot having a diameter of 306 mm, a straight trunk length of 2500 mm, a specific resistance of 0.01 Ω·cm, and an initial oxygen concentration of 1.0×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>

Thereafter, a rotating chamfering grindstone is pressed against the outer periphery of the silicon wafer to chamfer the wafer, and next both surfaces of the silicon wafer are simultaneously lapped by a double surface lapping device. Next, the lapped silicon wafer is immersed in an acidic etching solution in an etching bath to be etched, thus removing damage from chamfering and lapping. After this, the first polishing and the finish polishing described above are conducted in sequence on the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer.</div>

The first polishing solution includes silica grains from colloidal silica having an average particle size of 70 nm added at 5% by weight to 0.08% by weight of a piperidine aqueous solution, and contains 10 ppm of hydroxyethylcellulose. Moreover, when the polishing solution is used and the wafer holding method using the carrier plate <b>110</b> is employed in the first polishing, the carrier plate <b>110</b> vibrates due to the silicon wafer <b>11</b> shifting within the wafer housing <b>11</b> <i>a </i>during polishing.

Moreover, after removing the natural oxide films from the front and rear surfaces, the silicon wafer <b>11</b> and the polishing cloths <b>15</b> are further rotated relative to each other to polish the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer <b>11</b> approximately 5 μm per surface. At this time, the polishing cloths <b>15</b> are pressed against the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer <b>11</b> due to an effect of the polishing pressure.

As a result, polishing advances in a state where hydroxyethylcellulose is bonded to the outer periphery of the silicon wafer <b>11</b>. Thus, the front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer <b>11</b> are polished at a high polishing rate of 0.5 μm/min while maintaining a high degree of flatness due to an abrasion effect of the free abrasive grains, an etching effect of the alkaline aqueous solution, and an effect of removing hydroxyethylcellulose with the polishing cloth <b>15</b>.</div>

Thereby, the outer peripheral surface of the wafer is coated by the hydroxyethylcellulose in the polishing solution, which forms a protective film against etching on the outer peripheral surface of the wafer.

In contrast, in a case where a pliant polishing cloth made of suede is used as the polishing cloth for the first polishing, for example, the polishing cloths positioned above and below are in contact with the outer peripheral surface of the silicon wafer <b>11</b>, and thus roll-off on the outer periphery of the silicon wafer <b>11</b> is promoted.</div>
