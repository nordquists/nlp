<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Techniques for producing and processing wafers of compound single-crystals such as sapphire (α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), as base materials for LEDs or power devices which are expected to greatly glow in the future, are attracting attention. On each of these substrates, a crystalline thin film of GaN or the like is formed to integrate a device, so that a crystallographically less defective, high-quality surface is regarded to be important. In order to obtain the less defective, high smooth surface, a chemical mechanical polishing (hereinafter also referred to as CMP) technique is drawing attention. However, all of sapphire, SiC and GaN have very high hardness and also have high chemical stability, so that it is difficult to perform polishing with high efficiency while ensuring quality, particularly in polishing in a final stage which determines quality, and there has been a problem that a polishing step becomes very long.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In many cases, silicon oxide fine particles have hitherto been used for final polishing which determines quality of these single-crystal substrates. Some attempts to increase the polishing efficiency (removal rate) by using the silicon oxide fine particles have hitherto been made, and it has been proposed to increase the abrasive concentration (see Non-Patent Document 1), to mix two or more abrasives different in particle size at a predetermined ratio (see Patent Documents 1 and 2), to increase the polishing pressure/rotation speed, and the like.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in polishing of the single-crystal substrates using the silicon oxide fine particles, the polishing agent is generally used in cycles, and it is necessary to consider stability at the time when used for a long period of time. When the abrasive concentration is increased, the abrasive is aggregates by use, and the polishing efficiency becomes liable to substantially decrease. There is therefore a problem that the stability at the time when the polishing agent is used for a long period of time is deteriorated. Also in mixing of the abrasives, at mixing ratios which have hitherto been proposed, it is cited as a problem that not only an effect of improving the removal rate is limited, but also the stability of the polishing agent at the time when used for a long period of time is deteriorated. Further, when the polishing conditions are made strict, the removal rate can be increased. However, a problem of a wafer shape or polishing defects such as scratches becomes liable to be induced.</div>

However, with the progress of polishing, the polishing agent is contaminated with components of the material to be polished by polishing, so that there has been a problem that the conventional polishing agent is liable to bring about aggregation or gelation of polishing abrasives, which induces clogging of the pad to gradually decrease the removal rate. According to the polishing agent of the invention, the gelation or the aggregation due to the contamination of the components of the polished material, which are generated by the above-mentioned polishing, is difficult to occur, and the decrease in the removal rate at the time of cyclic use is suppressed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0050">That is to say, the polishing agent of the invention is characterized in that the initial removal rate is high, and that the decrease in the removal rate at the time of use in a cyclic system is suppressed. Thereby, not only the efficiency of the polishing step is improved, but also the downtime is shortened by a reduction in the consumption of the polishing agent or a decrease in dressing or flashing frequency of the pad. Further, this also leads to a reduction in the consumption of the pad, and the polishing step can be efficiently performed. It can therefore be said that the significance of the invention to improvement in mass production of various devices is very large.</div>

Taking the accumulated removal amount with the polishing agent of Example 7 as 1.00, the continuity of the abrasive was represented by the ratio thereof.
