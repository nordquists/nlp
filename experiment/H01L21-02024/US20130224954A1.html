</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a semiconductor device is formed by epitaxially growing a plurality of semiconductor layers on one surface of a semiconductor substrate. Since the aforementioned semiconductor layer is a thin film, it is desirable that one surface of the aforementioned semiconductor substrate be polished so as to eliminate unevenness, and it is also desirable that the semiconductor substrate be subjected to a cleaning processing so as to eliminate impurity particles. In those cases where the impurity particles attach to and remain on the surface of the semiconductor substrate, it would be difficult to form an epitaxially grown film, which is to be formed successively, without any defects. In addition, process yields in the formation of surface oxide films are also reduced considerably.</div>
