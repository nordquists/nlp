With this tendency, there are an increased number of cases where small defects on the surface of a substrate used in a semiconductor device have an adverse effect on the performance of the semiconductor device. Accordingly, overcoming nano-scale surface defects, which have never been regarded as a problem, has become important.</div>

In contrast, LPDs ascribed to foreign matter adhered to a substrate surface include LPDs ascribed to polishing materials, additives such as a water soluble polymer compound, pad debris, substrate swarf, dust in air and other foreign matters, which have not been completely removed in a cleaning step.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The presence of LPDs on a substrate surface causes deterioration of device characteristics such as a pattern defect and withstand voltage failure in a step for forming a semiconductor device, which reduces the yield. For this reason, it is necessary to reduce LPDs on a substrate surface. Furthermore, to reduce nano-scale LPDs, which have never been regarded as a problem, it is necessary to detect LPDs at a higher sensitivity. However, in the case where a substrate has a very small degree of surface roughness, light emitted from a probe of a surface-defect detection apparatus is reflected diffusely by the substrate surface. This phenomenon may generate noise during detection of LPDs. The fogging of the substrate caused by the diffuse reflection is referred to as haze. To detect LPDs at a higher sensitivity, it is necessary to improve the haze level of a substrate surface.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">Electrical conductivity is a value expressing the ability of a substance to allow electricity to go through it and expressed by an SI unit of S/cm. Generally, the higher the concentration of charged ions in a liquid, the easier the electricity goes through the liquid. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of such a liquid increases. In other words, an increase in electrical conductivity of the polishing composition of the present invention means an increase in concentration of ions in the composition. An increase rate of electrical conductivity due to an organic acid and an organic salt of the polishing composition of the present invention is calculated by dividing the electrical conductivity value of the polishing composition of the present invention by the electrical conductivity value of the composition (A). The electrical conductivity of the composition (A) and the polishing composition can be measured, for example, by a conductivity meter DS-14 manufactured by Horiba, Ltd. at a liquid temperature of 25° C.; however the measurement of electrical conductivity is not limited to this manner.</div>

Therefore, to prevent deterioration of the haze level of the substrate surface after polishing, it is necessary that the electrical conductivity of the polishing composition be no greater than 8 times the electrical conductivity of the composition (A) and preferably no greater than 5 times the electrical conductivity of the composition (A). If the electrical conductivity of the polishing composition is excessively larger than the electrical conductivity of the composition (A), the haze level of the substrate surface after polished deteriorates and thus not preferable. In view of this, if an organic acid or an organic salt is a monocarboxylic acid or a salt thereof, the electrical conductivity of the polishing composition is more preferably no greater than 3.5 times the electrical conductivity of the composition (A).

The silicon wafer to be used for the measurement of the water-repellent distance was prepared by polishing a silicon wafer having a diameter of 200 mm, a conductive type of P, a crystal orientation of &lt;100&gt; and a resistivity of 0.1 Ω·cm or more and less than 100 Ω·cm, by polishing slurry (trade name GLANZOX 2100) manufactured by Fujimi Incorporated and cutting the silicon wafer into chips 60 mm square.</div>
