<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, a method for producing a silicon wafer includes a slicing process of slicing a silicon ingot to obtain a thin disk-shaped wafer, a chamfering process of chamfering the outer region of the wafer obtained by the slicing process to prevent a fracture and a chip in the wafer, a lapping process of flattening the chamfered wafer, an etching process of removing mechanical damage remaining in the chamfered and lapped wafer, a polishing (polishing) process of mirror-polishing the front surface of the etched wafer, and a cleaning process of cleaning the polished wafer to remove a polishing agent and foreign substances attached to the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Those described above are only main processes, and a heat treatment process, a surface grinding process, and the like may be further added or the sequence of processes may be changed. Moreover, the same process maybe performed more than once. Then, an inspection or the like is performed, and the silicon wafer is sent to a device production process and an insulator film and a metal wiring line are formed on the front surface of the silicon wafer, whereby a device such as a memory is produced.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The above-described polishing process is a process that polishes the front surface of the silicon wafer to a mirror-smooth state by bringing the silicon wafer into sliding contact with the polishing pad while supplying the polishing agent, and mirror-polishing the silicon wafer to have a high degree of flatness and an improvement in polishing rate are sought after. As the polishing agent used in this polishing process, a polishing agent containing mainly alumina or colloidal silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is often used. In particular, a polishing agent in the form of a suspension (slurry) obtained by diluting alumina or colloidal silica with water and adding an alkali thereto is used.</div>

For example, as the above-described silica-based polishing agent, a polishing agent with a particle diameter of about 10 to 150 nm is used. The polishing performance is enhanced with an increase in the grain size of silica contained in the polishing agent. However, the larger the particle diameter becomes, the more polishing damage or the like occurs in the wafer surface.</div>

Accordingly, pure water or a surface-active agent is generally poured onto the surfaces of the silicon wafer to remove the alkali from the surfaces of the silicon wafer immediately after the completion of polishing. After the polishing is completed and before next polishing (a next batch) is performed, cleaning water is generally poured onto the polishing pads and the polishing pad is scrubbed with a brush and so on to remove foreign substances, by-products, agglomerate of the polishing agent from the polishing pad.</div>

Since the amount of the polishing agent that cannot be recovered in the tank is constant among the batches, the concentration of silicate ions can readily be adjusted by adjusting the amount of alkali to be added to the polishing agent in the tank.

The replacement rate indicates the proportion of the polishing agent that is recovered in the tank. The residual rate indicates the proportion of silicate ions remaining in the polishing agent to the silicate ions generated by the reaction between the silicon wafer and the alkali. Silicate ions that do not remain in the polishing agent are discharged to the outside of the system through the recoverable polishing agent. The residual rate is accordingly determined on the basis of the amount of the discharged polishing agent and the amount of the added alkali during polishing.
