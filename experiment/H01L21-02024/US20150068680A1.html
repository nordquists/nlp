<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing method and a polishing apparatus, and more particularly to a polishing method and a polishing apparatus for performing the planarization polishing of a surface (surface to be processed) of a substrate such as a single substrate made of a compound semiconductor containing an element such as Ga, Al, In, or the like, or a bonded substrate (epitaxial substrate) on which a compound semiconductor containing an element such as Ga, Al, In, or the like is mounted. The present invention is also related to a polishing method and a polishing apparatus, such as a catalyst-referred chemical processing system, for performing the planarization polishing of a surface (surface to be processed) of a substrate while monitoring the progress of a polishing process in order to determine the timing of an endpoint of the polishing process. (e.g., stoppage of polishing process or change of polishing conditions). Furthermore, the present invention relates to a polishing tool provided in such as the catalyst-referred chemical processing system.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The applicant has proposed a catalyst-referred chemical processing system for processing a surface (surface to be processed) of a substrate by placing the substrate in an acid processing solution, placing an acid or basic solid catalyst in contact with or in close proximity with the surface of the substrate, and eluting surface molecules of the surface which is held in contact with or in close proximity with the solid catalyst into the acid processing solution (see Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2008-121099). According to the catalyst-referred chemical processing system, the surface of the substrate (workpiece) is irradiated with light, preferably ultraviolet light, or a voltage is applied between the substrate and the solid catalyst, to promote oxidization of the surface for an increasing machining rate. The catalyst-referred chemical processing system makes it possible to planarize the surface of the substrate with only a chemical action while causing little damage to the surface of the substrate. However, it is generally difficult to planarize a surface of a single substrate made of a compound semiconductor containing an element Ga, for example, to a sufficiently highly accurate surface roughness within a practical given period of time.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Demands for finer and multi-layered interconnects for highly integrated semiconductor devices in recent years require that the surface of films such as metal films on the surface of substrates such as semiconductor wafers or the like be planarized to a high degree. To meet such demands, it has widely been customary to planarize the surface of films on the surface of substrates by removing surface irregularities therefrom according to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). In a chemical mechanical polishing process, it is necessary while a film is being polished to monitor the polished state of the film in order to stop polishing the film at a desired position. Therefore, it has been the general practice to monitor the polished state of an electrically conductive metal film formed on a surface of a substrate by applying an inductive magnetic field to the metal film and detecting the rate of attenuation of an eddy current generated in the surface of the metal film with an eddy current sensor for thereby measuring the thickness of the metal film.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The applicant has found that when a substrate of a compound semiconductor containing an element Ga is immersed in a processing liquid comprising a pH buffer solution of a neutral pH which contains Ga ions, and light is applied to the surface of the substrate or a bias potential is applied to the substrate, a Ga oxide is formed on the surface of the substrate, and the formed Ga oxide can be polished away by holding the Ga oxide and a polishing platen (polishing tool) in contact with each other and moving them relative to each other (see Japanese patent application No. 2009-78234).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it has been discovered that if light is applied to the surface of the substrate or a bias potential is applied to the substrate to form a Ga oxide, and the Ga oxide is polished away to flat the surface of the substrate of the compound semiconductor containing the element Ga, then it takes a long time to polish the surface of the substrate until the polished surface achieves a desired level of flatness or the polished surface fails to achieve a sufficient level of flatness.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, in a process of fabricating a substrate made of a semiconductor alone, called a bare substrate, a mass of semiconductor material known as an ingot is cut into substrates, and thereafter each surface of the substrate is polished for removing damage therefrom.</div>

The catalyst of the contact platen serves as a catalyst in the reception of electrons between the surface of the catalyst and the surface of the workpiece. The catalyst needs to be periodically replaced because it is mechanically worn when the surface of the workpiece is processed while the catalyst and the workpiece are pressed against each other and moved relative to each other. It has also been found that if a contact platen is constructed of a base such as of molybdenum or the like and a catalyst such as of platinum or the like attached to a surface of the base, then it is necessary to replace the contact platen as a whole when the catalyst is to be replaced, and hence the contact platen is highly costly.</div>
