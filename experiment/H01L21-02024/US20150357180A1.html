Typically, the front and back surfaces of the substrates are smoothed concurrently in an initial “rough” polish followed by a “finish” or “mirror” polish in which the front surface of the substrate is more finely smoothed.

<li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">Provisions of the present disclosure relate to methods for cleaning semiconductor substrates and, in particular, methods that involve cleaning with a cleaning bath including ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and a non-ionic surfactant. As compared to conventional methods, the methods of the present disclosure may reduce re-attachment of particles dislodged during the cleaning process thereby lowering defect counts. The methods may be well suited to reduce re-attachment of particles in batch immersion cleaning processes in which relatively high-diameter substrates (e.g., 300 mm and greater) are stacked at relatively tight pitch (e.g., half pitch) during cleaning, particularly in embodiments in which the substrates are stacked front-to-back (i.e., with the front surface of one substrate facing the back surface of another substrate). Compared to other surfactants, non-ionic surfactants are believed to have a reduced influence on the etch rate and on the zeta potential of the cleaning bath.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The semiconductor substrate may be composed of any material that may suitably be cleaned by SC-1 cleaning solutions. Structures which may be cleaned include, for example, silicon-on-insulator structures, epi-structures, heterostructures, single crystal silicon substrates and polysilicon substrates. These materials may comprise silicon, silicon carbide, sapphire, germanium, silicon germanium, gallium nitride, aluminum nitride, gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide, or quartz. In some embodiments, the semiconductor substrates are single crystal silicon wafers. Such wafers may be sliced from a single crystal ingot grown in accordance with conventional Czochralski crystal growing methods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The semiconductor substrates that are cleaned according to embodiments of the present disclosure have a front surface, a back surface, a circumferential edge and a central axis. The semiconductor substrate may be any diameter suitable for use by those of skill in the art including, for example, about 200 mm, about 300 mm, greater than about 300 mm or even about 450 mm diameter substrates. In some embodiments, the structures have a diameter of about 300 mm or more.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the semiconductor structures have been polished prior to cleaning. Polishing of wafers may be achieved using any polishing method known to those skilled in the art for reducing roughness and, for example, may be achieved by chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). CMP typically involves the immersion of the wafer in an abrasive slurry and polishing of the wafer by a polymeric pad. Through a combination of chemical and mechanical means the surface of the wafer is smoothed. Typically, the polish is performed until a chemical and thermal steady state is achieved and until the wafers have achieved their targeted shape and flatness. The rough polish may be performed on a double-side polisher commercially available from Peter Wolters (e.g., AC2000 polisher; Rendsburg, Germany), Fujikoshi (Tokyo, Japan) or Speedfam (Kanagawa, Japan). Stock removal pads for silicon polishing are available from Psiloquest (Orlando, Fla.) or Dow Chemical Company (Midland, Mich.) and silica based slurries may be purchased from Dow, Cabot (Boston, Mass.), Nalco (Naperville, Ill.), Bayer MaterialScience (Leverkusen, Germany) or DA NanoMaterials (Tempe, Ariz.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The rough polish may be applied to one surface of the wafer or, alternatively, to the front and back surfaces of the wafer. For example, the rough polish described above may be applied to both surfaces of the wafer through a double-side polish (DSP). A rough polish reduces the surface roughness of the wafer as measured with scan sizes of about 1 μm×about 1 μm to about 100 μm×about 100 μm to as low as about 1.5 Å and, more typically, to as low as about 1.9 Å. At shorter wavelengths a rough polish might reduce the surface roughness to less than about 2 Å as measured by scan sizes of about 0.1 μm×about 0.1 μm to about 1 μm×about 1 μm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">After the rough polish, the structure may be finished polished. The finish polish may be performed on commercially available polishers available from Speedfam (Kanagawa, Japan), Applied Materials, Inc. (Santa Clara, Calif.), LAM PLAN Industries Ltd. (Sevenoaks, United Kingdom), Dow Chemical Company (Midland, Mich.) and Strasbaugh (San Luis, Calif.). Polishing pads and slurries may be purchased from Fujimi Corporation (Tualatin, Oreg.), Nitta Haas, Inc. (Osaka, Japan) and Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (Aurora, Ill.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The finish polish reduces the surface roughness of the wafer from the level obtained by rough polishing to about 1.7 Å to about 1.0 Å as measured by scan sizes of about 1 μm×about 1 μm to about 30 μm×about 30 μm. Typically the finish polish is only applied to the front surface of the wafer; however the finish polish may be applied to both surfaces without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In embodiments in which the finish polish is not applied to the back surface of the substrate, the surface roughness of the front surface is generally less than the surface roughness of the back surface after finish polishing.</div>
