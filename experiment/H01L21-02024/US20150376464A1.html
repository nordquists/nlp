<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0007">Lately, higher quality surfaces have been demanded in semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers, etc. The precision of substrate surface inspection has also been improved. For instance, surface analyzers have been developed to detect fine defects such as scratches and bumps, etc., that are several deca-nanometers deep or high. If fine defects such as those detectable by these systems can be reduced, surfaces of higher quality can be obtained.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0008">Patent Document 1 discloses a technique that uses a polishing compound comprising hydroxyethyl cellulose and/or polyvinyl alcohol as well as a block polyether to improve the haze of a silicon wafer. Patent Document 2 discloses a technique that uses a polishing composition comprising colloidal or fumed silica having an average primary particle diameter of 5 nm to 30 nm and a water-soluble polymer to reduce the surface haze of a semiconductor wafer. However, haze reduction alone cannot effectively reduce fine defects (micro defects) as described above. Patent Document 3 teaches a technique that uses a water-soluble polymer having low viscosity as a semiconductor-wetting agent to enable easy removal by filtration of contaminants capable of causing micro defects and thereby to reduce the occurrence of micro defects. However, such a technique has been often insufficient in terms of the required level of latest micro defect reduction.</div>

Another objective of this invention is to provide a method for producing such a polishing composition. Another related objective is to provide a method for producing a polished article (e.g. substrate) comprising a surface having few micro defects.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0010">When a polishing object (work piece) is polished with a polishing composition comprising an abrasive and a water-soluble polymer in water, depending on the type of water-soluble polymer, the water-soluble polymer may adhere to the abrasive in the polishing composition, causing the abrasive to exist in the polishing composition as aggregates dimensionally larger than the abrasive itself (abrasive grains alone). Such aggregates may behave as grains in the polishing composition and their behavior may affect the mechanical working during the polishing. With respect to a polishing composition comprising an abrasive and a water-soluble polymer in water, as a physical value different from the dimensions of the abrasive itself, the present inventors have focused attention on the grain size in consideration of the presence of the aggregates. In other words, when the water-soluble polymer adheres to the abrasive (abrasive grains), entities that exhibit particle-like behavior in the polishing composition have been perceived as grains and their size has been considered as the size of the grains in the polishing composition. Using dynamic light scattering as the means capable of accurately determining the grain size, earnest studies have been conducted on the relationship between the grain size and micro defects in polished surfaces. As a result, grain sizes capable of effectively reducing the micro defects have been discovered, whereby the present invention has been completed.</div>

According to such a polishing composition, because the volume average particle diameter D<sub>A </sub>of the grains is limited to the prescribed range, the occurrence of micro defects (in particular, surface defects caused by polishing processes, generally called PID (polishing induced defects) can be effectively reduced.</div>

The polishing liquid comprises, as grains, the abrasive and aggregates formed by adhesion of the abrasive to the water-soluble polymer. In the polishing liquid, the grains have a volume average particle diameter D<sub>A </sub>of 20 nm to 60 nm when measured by dynamic light scattering. According to such a production method, because the volume average particle diameter D<sub>A </sub>of the grains in the polishing liquid is limited to the prescribed range, the occurrence of micro defects can be effectively reduced.

Generally, in the polishing composition used for polishing a polishing object, grains in several forms as exemplified above are thought to be present as a mixture.

According to the studies by the present inventors, by using a polishing liquid for which the particle size analysis yields a volume average particle diameter D<sub>A </sub>of a prescribed value or smaller (specifically 60 nm or smaller), as compared with an embodiment using a polishing liquid with a larger D<sub>A</sub>, the number of micro defects (e.g. the number of micro defects detected by the micro defect inspection described later in the working examples) can be significantly reduced.</div>

From the standpoint of balancing micro defect reduction and effects of polishing at a higher level, the D<sub>A </sub>is preferably 35 nm or larger, more preferably 40 nm or larger, or yet more preferably 45 nm or larger.

Thus, practically, when the D<sub>A </sub>value measured at a concentration equivalent to 0.2% (by mass) abrasive content (i.e. the D<sub>A </sub>value obtained, using the polishing composition at the aforementioned concentration as the measurement sample) is in the range, the aforementioned effects can be attained not only when using the polishing composition as a polishing liquid at 0.2% (by mass) abrasive content, but also when using the polishing composition at a different abrasive content (e.g. in the range between about 0.05 and 5% by mass, but different from 0.2% by mass).</div>

However, it may be considered as follows: In particular, larger grains (which can be the abrasive alone, abrasive with surrounding water-soluble polymer adhered thereto, abrasive/water-soluble polymer assemblies, etc.) in the polishing composition cause greater damage to the surface being polished, leading to a tendency for the occurrence of defects. The presence of rough grains may lead to uneven polishing, impairing the surface smoothness. Moreover, since rough grains have many points in contact or proximity with the surface of the polishing object (i.e. areas readily available for interactions between the two), they tend to stay on the polishing object's surface for a long time and are likely to remain on the polished surface after completion of the polishing. The remaining grains can be washed off. However, from the start of wash to the elimination of grains, on the polished surface, grain-bearing areas are less susceptible than the other areas to etching by the wash solution and thus remain as higher areas (protrusions) than the surrounding areas on the washed surface. These can be detected as micro defects (PID).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0097]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0097" num="0097">According to the art disclosed herein, by limiting the grain size of the polishing liquid to not become excessively large based on the volume average particle diameter D<sub>A</sub>, fewer grains remain on the polished surface or remaining grains are likely eliminated in an earlier stage of the wash (thus while there is no significant difference in the etched amount when compared with the surroundings). This is thought to contribute to reduce micro defects. In particular, from the standpoint of reducing the haze, an abrasive (e.g. an abrasive having an average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>of smaller than 35 μm (particularly 30 nm or smaller) or an average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>of 65 um or smaller (particularly 60 μm or smaller)) that is size-wise smaller than a conventional general abrasive can be more advantageous than an abrasive of a conventional size, but the behavior of abrasive grains in the polishing liquid are prone to the influence of the water-soluble polymer adhered to the grains.

In comparison of Examples 1 and 2, the use of the surfactant (PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer with Mw of 9000 herein) produced an effect to reduce the haze while keeping the great effect to reduce micro defects. According to Examples 2 to 4, both micro defect reduction and haze reduction were achieved at a particularly high level.</div>

With respect to Comparative Examples 1 and 2, while they had fewer micro defects than Comparative Examples 3 to 5, they had higher haze than Examples 1 to 5 and did not achieve both micro defect reduction and haze reduction at a high level. It is noted that in Comparative Examples 2 and 3, despite that their abrasive's average secondary particle diameters were about the same as or smaller than those of Examples 1 to 5, their grains in the polishing compositions had excessively large sizes (D<sub>A</sub>) and the cause for this may be the large Mw of the water-soluble polymers used in Comparative Examples 2 and 3.</div>
