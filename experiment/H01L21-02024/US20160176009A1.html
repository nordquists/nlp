<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This document is a Divisional application of U.S. patent Ser. No. 14/672,003 filed Mar. 27, 2015, which claims priorities to Japanese Patent Application Number 2014-072965 filed Mar. 31, 2014 and Japanese Patent Application Number 2014-229169 filed Nov. 11, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">As semiconductor devices have been in a trend toward high integration and high density in recent years, circuit interconnects are also becoming smaller and finer, and the larger number of layers are used to form multilayer interconnects. The multilayer interconnects with the finer circuits entail greater surface steps which reflect surface irregularities of lower layers. An increase in the number of interconnect layers would result in poor film formation (or step coverage) over stepped configurations of thin films. Therefore, better multilayer interconnects need to have the improved step coverage and proper surface planarization. Furthermore, miniaturization of a photolithographic process necessitates a smaller depth of focus in a photolithographic optical system, and therefore a surface of the semiconductor device needs to be planarized such that the irregularities or steps on the surface of the semiconductor device will fall within the depth of focus.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, in a process of manufacturing semiconductor devices, it becomes increasingly important to planarize a surface of the semiconductor device. One of the most important techniques in the surface planarization is chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). This chemical mechanical polishing is performed by bringing a wafer into sliding contact with a polishing surface of a polishing pad, while supplying a polishing liquid, containing abrasive particles such as silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) therein, onto the polishing surface to thereby polish the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">A CMP apparatus is a polishing apparatus for chemically and mechanically polishing a wafer. Such a polishing apparatus, which is called CMP apparatus, includes a plurality of polishing tables and a plurality of polishing heads in order to perform multistage polishing of a wafer. A wafer is transported to polishing pads on polishing tables successively, and is polished on the polishing pads by polishing heads successively. For example, rough polishing of a wafer is performed as a first-stage polishing, and final polishing of the wafer is performed as a second-stage polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The polishing apparatus is required to execute polishing recipes adapted to various polishing processes. To meet such requirement, high-performance polishing heads are used as the above-described plurality of polishing heads. More specifically, the polishing heads may each include a membrane for pressing a plurality of areas of a wafer independently, a retainer ring for pressing a polishing pad in an area around the wafer, etc.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, such a high-performance polishing head has a complicated structure and has costly consumables (the membrane, the retainer ring, etc.), and therefore entails an increased maintenance cost and an increased running cost. Further, a frequency of maintenance work will also increase, resulting in a decrease in an operation rate of the apparatus.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The above polishing head has a plurality of pressure chambers formed by the membrane. The pressure chambers are capable of changing the internal pressures, so that the polishing head can apply different polishing pressures to a plurality of areas of a wafer. Therefore, the polishing head can polish the wafer while individually controlling polishing rates in the respective areas of the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the polishing head of this type cannot control the polishing rate in smaller areas than the pressure chambers. It is possible to perform finer control of a wafer profile by using more pressure chambers, but there is a limit on the number of pressure chambers that can be provided in the polishing head. Furthermore, the above-described polishing head is not able to positively control a polishing rate of a wafer at a boundary between the pressure chambers, and therefore the polishing rate may be low at the boundary between the pressure chambers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">With the progress toward higher integration of semiconductor devices and in order to increase the productivity in manufacturing of semiconductor devices, there has recently been a strong demand for higher-performance polishing apparatus. Performance characteristics as required for the polishing apparatus may include a planarization capability (a capability of Dishing/Erosion), a polishing rate (also called a removal rate), a uniformity of polishing-rate distribution over a wafer surface, a low defect level of polished wafer, a throughput of the polishing apparatus, etc.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The above-described performance characteristics often require contradictory polishing conditions. For example, polishing with a low pressure is typically desirable for enhancing the planarization capability, while polishing with a high pressure is desirable for increasing the polishing rate and the throughput. In addition, polishing using a high-hardness polishing pad is typically desirable for enhancing the planarization capability, while use of a low-hardness polishing pad is often desirable in order to achieve a low defect level of a polished wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2010-50436 discloses a polishing apparatus having multiple polishing heads. When such a polishing apparatus is used to perform multistage polishing, different polishing liquids and different polishing pads are used in accordance with types of intended polishing, such as rough polishing, final polishing, etc., thus resulting in basically different polishing-rate distributions. Therefore, polishing head control characteristics, which are necessary to improve the uniformity of polishing rate in a wafer surface, differ between rough polishing and final polishing.</div>

In another exemplary process, in order to obtain different wafer-edge profiles in the first-stage polishing and the second-stage polishing, the first-stage polishing and the second-stage polishing are performed using polishing heads whose elastic membranes have different shapes of edge portions. It is also possible to use a high-hardness polishing pad in the first-stage polishing and to use, in the second-stage polishing, a polishing head whose retainer ring has the smaller number of grooves than the retainer ring used in the first-stage polishing or has a tapered or oval edge portion.

In high-pressure polishing, the elastic membrane <b>403</b> may be deformed greatly or the elastic membrane <b>403</b> may be twisted. As a result, a pressing force may not be applied uniformly to a wafer. Therefore, it is desirable that a polishing head for performing the high-pressure polishing use an elastic membrane having a higher hardness than the elastic membranes of the other polishing heads. The elastic membrane having a high hardness is less likely to be deformed or twisted, and therefore can apply a uniform pressing force to a wafer.</div>

In particular, when a vacuum is created in the pressure chamber D<b>3</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a wafer is attracted to the elastic membrane <b>403</b> through the holes. If the elastic membrane <b>403</b> is deformed or twisted during polishing of the wafer, the pressurized fluid can leak through the holes. In the event of leakage of the pressurized fluid, the elastic membrane <b>403</b> cannot press the wafer at an appropriate pressing force. This may result in a decrease in the polishing rate or variation in the polishing rate in the wafer surface, leading to a significant decrease in the productivity of the polishing apparatus. The use of the high-hardness elastic membrane <b>403</b> is effective also in preventing the leakage of the pressurized fluid from the elastic membrane <b>403</b> during polishing.</div>

Thus, a difference in the hardness of the elastic membrane of the polishing head may produce a difference in a polishing profile of a peripheral portion of a wafer. In general, an elastic membrane having a high hardness is not stretchy in its edge portion. Therefore, use of a high-hardness elastic membrane can result in a low pressure on a peripheral portion of a wafer, thus enabling a low polishing rate of the peripheral portion of the wafer. In contrast, an elastic membrane having a relatively low hardness is stretchy in its edge portion. Therefore, use of a low-hardness elastic membrane can result in a relatively high pressure on a peripheral portion of a wafer, thus increasing a pressing force applied to the peripheral portion of the wafer, as compared to the use of the high-hardness elastic membrane.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0155]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0156" num="0155">It is possible to use a polishing pad made of a relatively hard material, such as foamed polyurethane, in first-stage rough polishing and to use, in second-stage final polishing, a polishing pad which is softer than the polishing pad used in the first-stage polishing. In this case, the life of the polishing pad for the final polishing can be increased by using, in the second-stage final polishing, a retainer ring <b>405</b> having a different structure from a retainer ring <b>405</b> used in the first-stage polishing. Examples of the retainer ring <b>405</b> for use in the second-stage final polishing include a retainer ring having the small number of grooves <b>407</b>, a retainer ring having no groove <b>407</b>, a retainer ring having narrow grooves <b>407</b>, a retainer ring whose outer edge portion, which is to make contact with the polishing pad, has a tapered shape, and a retainer ring whose outer edge portion has an oval shape.</div>

The retainer ring <b>405</b> is usually rubbed against the polishing pad <b>10</b> in the presence of the polishing liquid, and therefore the bottom surface of the retainer ring <b>405</b> wears gradually. Fine particles, generated from the retainer ring <b>405</b>, can be attached as foreign matter to a wafer during polishing of the wafer or cause damage, such as scratching, to the surface of the wafer. Therefore, when using a polishing liquid containing abrasive particles, it is preferred to use a retainer ring <b>405</b> made of a material having high wear resistance. When using a polishing liquid containing no abrasive particles or containing abrasive particles at a low concentration, it is preferred to use a retainer ring <b>405</b> made of a soft material in order to prevent scratching of a wafer. In order to meet various requirements for multistage polishing, the use of retainer rings <b>405</b> of different materials in the first-stage polishing and the second-stage polishing is sometimes effective. Examples of materials usable for retainer rings <b>405</b> include ceramics such as SiC, resins such as PPS, PEEK, PTFE, PP, polycarbonate and polyurethane, and the resins containing a filler to enhance the wear resistance.</div>
