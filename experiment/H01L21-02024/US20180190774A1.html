In recent years in particular, diamond thin film devices have been developed such as ultraviolet emitting element utilizing wide bandgap and field effect transistor with good high-frequency characteristics.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The diamond thin film device described above is produced by plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition). At that time, metal, silicon, and the like can be used as a foundation substrate for a diamond thin film to grow. Moreover, in order to obtain a diamond thin film with high crystallinity, it is preferable that a diamond substrate be used as a foundation substrate to be homoepitaxially grown, and thereby it becomes possible to improve characteristics of the diamond thin film device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to obtain a high-quality and uniform diamond thin film, appropriate growth conditions and a diamond substrate appropriate for the conditions as a foundation substrate are required. In order to obtain a uniform diamond thin film, film formation condition needs to be uniform over the diamond substrate as the foundation substrate. When a diamond thin film is grown by a plasma CVD method, the substrate temperature is kept constant by taking a balance between heating by plasma and cooling by water cooling stage. At that time, in the case in which the irregularity of the diamond substrate as the foundation substrate is remarkable, contact with a cooling stage becomes ununiform and the temperature of the diamond substrate during growth becomes ununiform. As a result, quality of the diamond thin film grown on the foundation substrate becomes ununiform.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to carry out preferable homoepitaxial growth, as disclosed in Non-Patent Literature 1, it is reported that angle variation of the crystal axis of the diamond substrate as the foundation substrate is preferably within 3.5°±1.5°.</div>

However, when diamond is to be used as a semiconductor device, a diamond substrate with large area with the diameter of 2 inches (about 50 mm) or more is required as a foundation substrate in terms of producibility of the device. However, it has not been possible to produce a diamond substrate with large area by a typical HTHP method. In order to solve this problem, heteroepitaxial growth for growing large-area diamond crystal for a foundation substrate on an MgO substrate has been developed, and large-area diamond substrate is becoming realistic.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve a diamond substrate with large area, heteroepitaxial growth technique is under development. However, a diamond substrate with less irregularity and high in-plane uniformity of the angle variation of the crystal axis has not been achieved yet. This is because, when diamond crystal with large area is to be produced by a heteroepitaxial growth method, the diamond crystal grown on the foundation substrate is warped by a difference in thermal expansion coefficient and lattice constant with the foundation substrate. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(<i>a</i>)</figref>, when the warped diamond crystal is processed in a substrate shape, the surface of the processed diamond substrate becomes flat surface without warpage as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(<i>b</i>)</figref>, but angle of the in-plane crystal axis varies. In this case, even if the medium value of the angle of the crystal axis in the diamond substrate is adjusted by processing, there will be an area outside 3.5°±1.5° in the case in which the angle variation of the crystal axis in the substrate is 3° or more, and the quality of the diamond thin film is lowered.</div>

Although it seems that the angle of the crystal axis varies, the angle between the actual surface of the diamond substrate and the crystal axis is uniform in a microscopic view, and the in-plane uniformity of the angle variation of the crystal axis is high in terms of crystal growth. Meanwhile, with respect to the shape of the diamond substrate, warpage before the process is kept even after the process.</div>

According to this configuration, since it is possible to reduce influence of variation of the crystal axis of the diamond substrate to the crystal axis of the semiconductor film formed over the entire surface of the diamond substrate, angle variation of the crystal axis of the semiconductor film is reduced and it becomes possible to reduce occurrence of in-plane variation of the characteristics of the semiconductor film. At the same time, since it becomes possible to keep the temperature in the diamond substrate more constant when heating a functional thin film (for example, semiconductor film and the like) in formation thereof, it becomes possible to reduce occurrence of in-plane variation of the characteristics of the semiconductor film.

According to this configuration, it becomes possible to reduce the inclination angle of the crystal plane inside the substrate at both edges of the diamond substrate with the diameter of 2 inches, for example, to about 1°. Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the variation of the angle of the crystal axis to more than 0° and 0.59° or less. Therefore, it becomes possible to further reduce occurrence of in-plane variation of the characteristics of the semiconductor film formed over the entire surface of the diamond substrate. At the same time, since it becomes possible to keep the temperature in the diamond substrate more constant when heating a functional thin film (for example, semiconductor film and the like) in formation thereof, it becomes possible to reduce occurrence of in-plane variation of the characteristics of the semiconductor film.

Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce occurrence of in-plane variation of the characteristics of the semiconductor film formed over the entire surface of the diamond substrate more than any other modes.
