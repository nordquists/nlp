Accordingly, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is an indispensable technology for production processes of semiconductor devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">CMP is based on, for example, relative movement of a semiconductor substrate such as a single crystal silicon substrate and a polishing pad while the semiconductor substrate is held and pressed against the polishing pad, to which a polishing composition containing abrasive grains and reagents is supplied, attached onto a turn table. This brings a chemical reaction with the reagents and a mechanical polishing effect of the abrasive grains, and makes it possible to grind an uneven surface of the substrate to flatten the surface.</div>
