Accordingly, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is an indispensable technology for production processes of semiconductor devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">CMP is based on, for example, relative movement of a semiconductor substrate such as a single crystal silicon substrate and a polishing pad while the semiconductor substrate is held and pressed against the polishing pad, to which a polishing composition containing abrasive grains and reagents is supplied, attached onto a turn table. This brings a chemical reaction with the reagents and a mechanical polishing effect of the abrasive grains, and makes it possible to grind an uneven surface of the substrate to flatten the surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, improvement in productivity of semiconductor devices is required to reduce the cost, and emphasis is placed on the flatness around the end faces of semiconductor substrates to produce devices over as wide areas of the substrates as possible.
