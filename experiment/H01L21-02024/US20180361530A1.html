Specifically, semiconductor wafers in which F-ZDD&lt;0 are required, that is, the shapes of semiconductor wafers are required to have sag geometry at the periphery.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In a production process of a semiconductor wafer, the semiconductor wafer is typically subjected to double-side polishing. In double-side polishing, a semiconductor wafer is interposed between polishing pads that are individually attached to the upper and lower turn tables, and the semiconductor wafer is subjected to sliding motion to polish the both surfaces of the front surface and the back surface simultaneously (see Patent Literature 1, for example). The double-side polishing is conventionally performed by using upper and lower turn tables to which polishing pads of the same kind with the same thickness are attached. In this case, the F-ZDD can be less than 0 by increasing the thickness of the polishing pads.</div>
