<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">As semiconductor design rule is becoming finer, surfaces of silicon substrates are required to have higher-quality finishes. For instance, it is expected to further reduce micro defects induced by polishing processes, which are generally called PID (polishing induced defects).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">An objective of the present invention is thus to provide a silicon substrate polishing method according to which PID can be reduced. Another related objective is to provide a polishing composition set that can be preferably used in such a polishing method.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">It is generally thought that formation of micro defects such as PID is caused in a final polishing step or a later step carried out using a polishing slurry that is less abrasive as compared to the one used in a stock polishing step. A typical example of the less abrasive polishing slurry is a final polishing slurry comprising a water-soluble polymer such as hydroxyethyl cellulose. As for means to reduce PID, for instance, studies are underway on compositions of final polishing slurries used in final polishing steps.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, the stock polishing step is generally thought as a step to prepare the shape of a silicon substrate and roughly condition of its surface prior to the final polishing step. In typical, as compared to the final polishing step, the stock polishing step generally uses a more removal polishing slurry to remove the surface of the silicon substrate, thereby efficiently reducing the surface roughness Ra, etc. Conventionally, it has been thought that what is done in the stock polishing step has little impact on micro defects in the outermost surface, such as PID after the final polishing step. For instance, in Patent Document 1, while the stock polishing is carried out on the same platen while switching polishing slurries, its purpose is to produce highly flat and smooth wafers with a high yield in a highly productive manner in a stock polishing step. In other words, Patent Document 1 is not aimed to reduce PID after the final polishing step Likewise, neither Patent Document 2 nor 3 suggests an idea of carrying out the stock polishing step to reduce PID existing after the final polishing step. Under such circumstances, the present inventor has found that when the stock polishing step is suitably carried out, PID after the final polishing step can be efficiently reduced; whereby the present invention has been made.</div>

By limiting at least either the total weight of Cu or the total weight of Ni in the final stock polishing slurry P<sub>F </sub>to or below the prescribed value, PID at the end of the final polishing step can be reduced.

In this manner, when, in the stock polishing step, the polishing is carried with the non-final stock polishing slurry P<sub>N </sub>and then further with the final stock polishing slurry P<sub>F </sub>with a lower Cu concentration and/or a lower Ni concentration, a silicon substrate with yet fewer PID at the end of the final polishing step can be obtained.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0053">When the polishing slurry supplied to the silicon substrate includes Cu and Ni, in an area where they have touched, the surface of the silicon substrate may be locally oxidized to form SiO<sub>2</sub>. Here, a stock polishing step generally uses a stock polishing slurry that shows a high polishing removal rate and powerful mechanical polishing effect (effect to mechanically remove the surface of the silicon substrate) as compared to a final polishing slurry. Thus, it is thought that, during polishing with the stock polishing slurry, local formation of SiO<sub>2 </sub>on the silicon substrate caused by the Cu and Ni in the stock polishing slurry takes place in parallel while the silicon sub-surface including the local SiO<sub>2 </sub>is being removed by the abrasive power of the stock polishing slurry. On the other hand, from the standpoint of reducing haze and preventing scratches, the final polishing step uses a final polishing slurry that shows weaker mechanical polishing effect. In addition, polishing slurry for polishing silicon substrates is prepared to be suited to polishing silicon (typically monocrystalline Si); and therefore, it shows a significantly lower polishing removal rate with SiO<sub>2 </sub>than with Si. Thus, it is thought that, when SiO<sub>2 </sub>is present locally in an area of the silicon sub-surface at the end of the polishing with the stock polishing slurry (i.e. at the end of the last stock polishing sub-step), the amount (depth) of the surface removed in this area during the final polishing step is relatively smaller than its surroundings with Si; as a result, the area is detected as PID (a bump defect induced by a polishing process).</div>

The same mechanism may be involved in reduction of PID achieved by controlling the concentrations of Cu and/or Ni in the final stock polishing slurry P<sub>F </sub>or their weight ratio relative to the abrasive. Because the stock polishing step includes several stock polishing sub-steps, a high degree of freedom is allowed in designing a stock polishing sub-step carried out before the final stock polishing sub-step, that is, a non-final polishing sub-step (e.g. in selecting the composition of polishing slurry used and setting the polishing time, etc.).
