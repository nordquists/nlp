<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">GaN is a semiconductor that has features of a short bond length between its constituent atoms and a large band gap compared to those of each of the traditional semiconductor materials represented by Si. Epitaxial growth is first conducted for a GaN free-standing substrate as a process to form a structure of an optical device or a power device on a GaN substrate. When the epitaxial growth surface is constituted by a single (0001) surface, a portion may be present in the epitaxial growth surface to be a seed of contingent crystal growth such as a fault or a foreign object. In this case, when vapor phase epitaxy of GaN is conducted for the epitaxial growth surface using, for example, a MOCVD method, Ga atoms may aggregate to each seed of the contingent crystal growth and locally uneven growth may occur. To prevent the locally uneven growth, a method is present according to which an off-angle inclined by a certain angle relative to the crystal direction is set for the epitaxial growth surface to artificially produce an atomic step. The Ga raw material is thereby partially bonded with methyl groups and, in this state, moves in the (0001) surface (migration of Ga raw material) that is the epitaxial growth surface when the vapor phase epitaxy of GaN is conducted on the GaN substrate using the MOCVD method. When a stable position is present, the Ga raw material stops at the position and releases the bond with the methyl groups to be bonded with N for the epitaxial growth to thereby be continued. The epitaxial growth can therefore be stabilized by setting the off-angle in the epitaxial growth surface and utilizing the steps adjacent to each other as the stable positions. In addition, when the epitaxial growth is conducted, an advantage is present that even and clean growth can be conducted. Japanese Patent Publication No. 5496007 describes a GaN substrate with the off-angle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Publication No. 5496007 describes a GaN substrate including a GaN (0001) surface that is off-cut at an angle of 0.2 to 10 degrees from a [0001] direction and a GaN (000-1) surface that is off-cut at an angle of 0.2 to 10 degrees from a [000-1] direction. The off-cut GaN (0001) surface is parallel to the off-cut GaN (000-1) surface and form the GaN substrate having a lattice curvature as a whole.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A GaN crystal can be formed on a foundation substrate represented by sapphire using a vapor phase epitaxial method such as, for example, a hydride vapor phase epitaxial method (an HVPE method) or a metal organic chemical vapor deposition method (an MOCVD method). In the GaN crystal grown on a hetero substrate, warpage is however generated that is originated from the difference in the lattice constant or the difference in the thermal expansion between GaN substrate and the hetero substrate that is the foundation substrate, and warpage of the crystal is thereby generated. When the foundation substrate is cut off from the GaN free-standing substrate having the foundation substrate to obtain the GaN free-standing substrate alone, then, the GaN free-standing substrate is processed to have parallel flat faces, the physical shape of the substrate surface is the flat face while dispersion of the off-angle, that is, an off-angle distribution is generated because warpage is generated in the crystal. When the dispersion of the off-angle is generated, locally uneven growth occurs in the epitaxial growth or no stable growth may be acquired. For example, for an optical device, dispersion of the property of the device structure finally occurs and this derives as a dispersion of the light emission wavelength.</div>

The axis of abscissa represents a position (mm) on the substrate when the substrate center is set to be 0 mm, and the axis of ordinate represents the angle (deg) that is the difference from the formed off-angle, that is, the off-angle distribution. In the case where the X-axis direction is set as a [1-100] direction and the Y-axis direction is set as a [11-20] direction as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the measurement result of the off-angle distribution on the X-axis line (a line <b>1</b>) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the measurement result of the off-angle distribution on the Y-axis line (a line <b>2</b>). This GaN substrate is, for example, a substrate that has an off-angle of 0.4 deg formed therein in a [1-100] direction, and the off-angle is 0 deg in the [11-20] direction. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the off-angle distribution relative to the off-angle of 0.4 deg formed in the X-axis direction has a distribution in the X-axis direction. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the off-angle distribution relative to the off-angle of 0 deg formed in the Y-axis direction has a distribution in the Y-axis direction. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the off-angle distribution becomes larger as the measurement position becomes closer to the outer circumference. The off-angle distribution is represented as angles in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> while, when the off-angle distribution is represented as the distance that indicates the warpage of the crystal for each of four directions depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, concave shapes as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are acquired, and the difference in the height for the width of 2 inches (50 mm) is 0.1 mm or larger. To set the off-angle distribution to be 0 deg, it is an option to form the shape of the surface to be same as the warpage of the crystal as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Having the difference in the height of the substrate surface of 0.1 mm or larger means having the total thickness variation (TTV) of 0.1 mm or larger. When this substrate is used, at the steps of fabricating the device, a failure such as defocusing may however occur when an exposure process is conducted to form the pattern of each of the device structure and the wiring structure on the side of the epitaxial growth surface. In the back-grinding to reduce the thickness of the GaN substrate, because the back face is processed to have a flat face shape, devices having different thicknesses may be fabricated due to the total thickness variation and dispersion of the device property may be generated depending on the location (the thickness).</div>

When the off-angle distribution in this case is about 0.5 deg, the substrate surface acquired when the off-angle distribution is set to be 0.25 deg that is ½ of the above as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has the difference in the height of about 30 μm as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.

As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an off-angle distribution is generated by warpage of the crystal. To set the off-angle distribution of the GaN substrate to be zero, the surface only has to be processed being matched with the shape of the warpage of the crystal. A difference in the height (the thickness distribution) of 60 μm or larger is however generated by processing the surface to have a concave shape that has a difference in the height of 60 μm or larger between the outer edge and the center. As above, in this state, a failure occurs in steps of forming a device. To reduce this total thickness variation, the shape of a N face only has to be processed to be the same shape as that of a Ga face (a convex shape when seen from the N face). In this case, the off-angle distribution of the N face also becomes zero.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0066]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0067" num="0066">At steps of epitaxial growth using the GaN substrate, a problem may arise in the installation of the GaN substrate to a susceptor in the case where the shape of the N face is, for example, a convex when seen from the N face. For example, when the GaN substrate is placed to lie on the N face thereof on the susceptor used for the epitaxial growth, a temperature distribution may be generated because a distance is established between the susceptor and the N face, and a dispersion is generated in the properties of the grown film. As a result, variation of the wavelength of the device is generated. The N face therefore only has to be able to be installed on the susceptor and the off-angle distribution of the N face only has to be larger than the off-angle distribution of the Ga face. For example, the degree of flatness of the N face may be maintained because the function for the N face may not provide reduction of the off-angle distribution.</div>

When the off-angle distribution is 0.1 deg, the wavelength has a dispersion of about 10 nm. For example, for the wavelength of 450 nm of a blue LED, to set the dispersion of the wavelength to be 25 nm or smaller, the off-angle distribution needs to be set to be 0.25 deg or smaller. When the dispersion of the wavelength is larger than 25 nm, the blue color to be an element of a white light disperses and this acts as a cause of color unevenness of the white light. The temperature distribution and the raw material gas distribution can each be set to be uniform when the semiconductor layer is epitaxial-grown on the GaN substrate by reducing the total thickness variation. Any error of each of the exposure patterns can be reduced for the photolithography at the device fabrication steps and, when the total thickness variation is 20 μm or smaller, stable exposure can be conducted. The surface only has to be processed to match with the shape of the warpage of the crystal as above as the reduction of the off-angle distribution while the reduction of the off-angle distribution and the increase of the total thickness variation are in a trade-off relation with each other.</div>

For example, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a section whose position from the substrate center (0 mm) is −20 mm or smaller and +20 mm or larger is set to be the curved face portion as the correction section for the off-angle.

The border between the flat face section and the correction section is processed to be a smooth curved line. With the shape as above mentioned, the correction section can reduce the off-angle distribution. On the other hand, the flat face section has the original off-angle and can therefore satisfy the off-angle distribution of 0.25 deg or smaller and the difference in the height of 20 μm or smaller for the overall area thereof.
