Consequently, the inventor has found that the above problem can be solved by the following procedure: a chamfering stage in which the processing is performed such that the resulting arc portions have radii of curvature R1 and R2 smaller than R1 and R2 values in a specification range of chamfered shape in a final wafer product; and a stage of mirror-polishing the chamfered portion in which the mirror-polishing is performed such that the resulting R1 and R2 are within the specification range.

However, conventionally, R1 and R2 in the chamfering stage have not been set smaller than a specification of a final wafer, unlike the present invention. Particularly, in the conventional approach, in order that the R1 and R2 of arc portions of a final wafer are within a specification range, arc portions immediately after chamfering are designed to have R1 and R2 equivalent to those of the final wafer; meanwhile, the step of mirror-polishing the chamfered portion is performed so as not to greatly change the R1 and R2 of the arc portions.</div>
