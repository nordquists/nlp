<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0006">As semiconductor design rules are becoming finer, it is required to finish the silicon substrate to a surface of higher quality. For example, it is desirable to further reduce the number of micro particles generally referred to as LPD (Light Point Defect; LPD) on the surface after final polishing. Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique for improving the wettability of the surface after polishing and reducing micro defects such as adhesion of particles and the like by using a final polishing composition containing a water-soluble polymer compound having a low viscosity. Patent Literature 2 discloses a technique for similarly improving wettability after polishing and reducing surface defects by using hydroxyethyl cellulose which satisfies predetermined radius of gyration and contact angle. However, even with such techniques, it is sometimes impossible to cope sufficiently with the recent level of requirements relating to surface quality after final polishing.</div>

Further, the polishing composition used in the intermediate polishing step is referred to as an “intermediate polishing composition”. Therefore, the intermediate polishing composition in the art disclosed herein is grasped as a polishing composition of the type used second from the downstream side among a plurality of types of polishing compositions used in the process of polishing a silicon substrate.

As a result, the smoothness of the surface of the polishing object (here, a silicon substrate) when completed the intermediate polishing step can be further enhanced. A high smoothness when completed the intermediate polishing means that the roughness to be eliminated in the final polishing step is a small amount and the pressure on the final polishing step is small. Therefore, even where a final polishing composition having lower removal ability such as polishing removal ability is used in the final polishing step, the roughness presenting at the start of the final polishing can be reduced to a desired level. By using the final polishing composition with lower removal ability, the pressure applied to the polishing object in the final polishing step call be reduced to prevent the occurrence of defects, and the surface quality of the polishing object after the final polishing can be improved.</div>
