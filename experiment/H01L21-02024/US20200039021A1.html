<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicon wafers and compound semiconductor wafers of GaAs etc. are known as semiconductor wafers. Semiconductor wafers are typically obtained by performing a slicing step of slicing a single crystal ingot into thin disk-shaped wafers using a wire saw, a grinding step of making the sliced wafer have flat front and back surfaces and a predetermined thickness, and a polishing step of performing mirror polishing for eliminating irregularities on the surfaces of the wafer having been subjected to grinding to achieve high flatness. Further, depending on use, an epitaxial layer may be formed using MOCVD etc. on a surface of a semiconductor wafer having been polished.</div>

For example, the center of a semiconductor wafer may have a convex shape or a concave shape. Therefore, in double-side polishing, the polishing conditions are required to be controlled to meet the requirements so that a semiconductor wafer having a desired shape is obtained.</div>

Further, in double-side polishing, when polishing proceeds, changes in the polishing environment such as wear on polishing pads, change in slurry temperature during polishing, and local change in the amount of slurry supplied are inevitable, and such changes in the polishing environment lead to further deterioration in the polishing quality.

Accordingly, even if the technique described in PTL 1 can modify the polishing conditions for the next and subsequent polishing procedures, it cannot provide for changes in the polishing environment during a polishing procedure. As with the technique described in PTL 1, in conventional double-side polishing methods, although polishing conditions may be changed between a plurality of stages, specific polishing conditions for each stage are determined before starting polishing, and the polishing conditions are not adjusted once polishing is started. Therefore, double-side polishing methods using the conventional techniques have limitations to improving the yield since semiconductor wafers processed in a batch in which the polishing environment changes during polishing become defective products. Further, the polishing quality in terms of whether a polished semiconductor wafer has a target shape (that is, shape controllability) would vary in double-side polishing methods using the conventional techniques.</div>

The number of measurements is a number sufficient to provide statistical significance. As the shape index of a semiconductor wafer, GBIR (global backside ideal range) can be used, which is a typical global flatness index for evaluating the thickness variation in the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer. Note that GBIR is a positive value since it is defined with an absolute value; therefore, GBIR cannot express irregularities on a semiconductor wafer. Even if similar values are measured, radically different results may be obtained by visual evaluation; for example, when the thickness of the center of a semiconductor wafer is larger than the average thickness of the semiconductor wafer, the semiconductor wafer is determined to have a convex center shape by visual observation and is determined to have a concave center shape by visual observation in the opposite case. When the thickness of the center of a semiconductor wafer is larger than the average thickness of the semiconductor wafer, the value of GBIR is expressed with a plus sign, whereas when the thickness of the center of a semiconductor wafer is smaller than the average thickness of the semiconductor wafer, the value of GBIR is expressed with a minus sign.

GBIR (plus/minus) corresponds to the relation between the thickness of the center of the wafer described above and the average thickness.

Thus, the inventors found that when apparatus log data during polishing are plugged into the above formula (1), the shape index of a semiconductor wafer at that point of time during can be evaluated accurately, and polishing tendencies of double-side polishing (the progress of polishing found by comparing a convex center shape or a concave center shape with the target shape) can be determined. In this embodiment, while polishing on a semiconductor wafer is continued, the shape of the semiconductor wafer is evaluated using the criterion function of the above formula (1), and polishing conditions are adjusted based on the value of the criterion function, thereby performing polishing under the adjusted polishing conditions.</div>
