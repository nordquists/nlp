That is, in the primary polishing step, while supplying a polishing member A containing abrasive grains, the silicon carbide substrate is polished while rotating a platen having attached thereto a polishing pad. As a result of this rotation, frictional heat is generated between the abrasive grains and the silicon carbide substrate. This frictional heat presumably reaches 1000° C. or more (1500° C. or more in some cases), that is, presumably, the same phenomenon as in the case of obtaining the mixture calcined product occurs. Accordingly, presumably, the abrasive grains having such characteristics cause a solid-phase reaction with the silicon carbide substrate at the time of polishing, and, due to the action of the solid-phase reaction, the polishing of the silicon carbide substrate is accelerated.

<li> <para-num num="[0098]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0102" num="0098">As is clear from Table 1 above, it is shown that according to the polishing method of the present invention, even when a polishing pad, which usually does not lead to an increase in polishing speed, is used, the polishing speed can be increased. In addition, because a polishing pad is used, leveling (start-up operation) and facing are unnecessary. Accordingly, the overall operating efficiency also increases, which contributes to the improvement of the silicon carbide substrate polishing efficiency.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0099]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0103" num="0099">In contrast, according to Comparative Examples 1, 2, and 4 where a platen (cast iron) was used in the primary polishing step, although the polishing performance is high, leveling (start-up operation) and facing are necessary. Thus, the overall operating efficiency does not increase, and the silicon carbide substrate polishing efficiency does not increase either.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0100]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0104" num="0100">Meanwhile, in Comparative Example 3, the primary polishing step is polishing using a pad, and thus leveling (start-up operation) and facing are unnecessary. However, the polishing performance is significantly low, and, from the overall standpoint, the silicon carbide substrate polishing efficiency does not increase.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0101]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0105" num="0101">Points to pay to attention about the present invention are as follows.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0102]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0106" num="0102">Point (i): The Vickers hardness of SiC is 2,150 Hv, and the Vickers hardness of B<sub>4</sub>C is 2,250 Hv. Therefore, the hardness of abrasive grains and the hardness of the object to be polished are on the same level. Further, because not a metal platen but a polyurethane polishing pad is used, usually, the polishing performance hardly increases. Actually, when a polishing is performed with abrasive grains having the same hardness as that of the object to be polished, the polishing performance hardly increases (Comparative Example 3). In contrast, according to the method of the present invention, high polishing performance is exerted (Example 1).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0103]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0107" num="0103">Point (ii): A common silicon carbide polishing process includes a rough lapping step, a diamond lapping step (platen, abrasive grains: diamond), and a CMP step (polishing pad, abrasive grains: colloidal silica). However, according to the present invention, an alternative means for the diamond lapping (platen, abrasive grains: diamond) step which uses particularly high-cost diamond, or a better means, is expected to be provided.</div>
