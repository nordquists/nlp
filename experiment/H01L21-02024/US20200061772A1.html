<li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">To solve the above problem, the present inventors have earnestly studied and found out that the hydrophilicity on the surface of a resinous carrier contributes to the polishing rate for a semiconductor silicon wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0035">The present inventors have quantified the hydrophilicity by measuring contact angles to pure water. Thus, the inventors have found that when an average contact angle of front and back surfaces of a carrier is 45° or more and 60° or less and a difference in average contact angles between the front surface and the back surface is 5° or less, the polishing rate for a wafer can be significantly enhanced. These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.</div>

As the polishing pads <b>5</b>, for example, foamed polyurethane pads can be used.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, a slurry supply mechanism <b>6</b> (a nozzle <b>7</b> and a through hole <b>8</b> in the upper turn table <b>4</b>) configured to supply a slurry between the upper turn table <b>4</b> and the lower turn table <b>3</b> is provided at an upper portion of the upper turn table <b>4</b>.

Thus, the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is a 4-way type double-side polishing apparatus.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that the inventive double-side polishing apparatus is not limited to such a planetary gear type, and can also be an oscillation type.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0043]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0044" num="0043">This carrier <b>1</b> is made of a resin. An average contact angle with pure water of front and back surfaces of the carrier <b>1</b>, which come into contact with the polishing pads <b>5</b>, is 45° or more and 60° or less, and a difference in average contact angles between the front surface and the back surface is 5° or less. The inventive carrier <b>1</b> satisfies the contact angle conditions as described above. This makes it possible to significantly enhance the polishing rate for the wafer W in comparison with a case of employing a conventional resinous carrier. The polishing rate can be enhanced by, for example, 10% or more, further 25% or more, or more than these. Depending on a conventional carrier to be compared, the present invention can also make the polishing rate double or more. As a result, the productivity for double-side polished wafers can be significantly increased.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">Incidentally, for the contact angle measurement of the carrier, for example, PCA-11 manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd. can be used. In the measurement, for example, 2.0 μL drops of pure water are dropped at five locations on each surface, and the contact angles are determined by image analysis. Their average value can be regarded as an average value of the single surface. Further, when the front and back surfaces are considered, an average value and a difference thereof can be calculated from an average value of the front surface and an average value of the back surface. Nevertheless, the contact angle measurement method is not limited thereto, and can be determined each time. As necessary, the measurement can be performed not at five locations but at more locations (or fewer locations) to obtain an average value.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the carrier <b>1</b> should be made of a resin that at least satisfies the aforementioned predetermined contact angle conditions.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">More preferably, the carrier <b>1</b> is a resin stacked plate. As an example of the constituent material, it is possible to use a composite material (FRP) in which a hydrophilic fibrous base material is impregnated with a resin. Examples of the fibrous base material include glass, liquid crystal polymer, cellulose, and the like. Examples of the resin include epoxy, aramid, phenol, and the like. These materials per se have been commonly used heretofore, and can be easily prepared to manufacture the carrier <b>1</b>. Nevertheless, in the present invention, the hydrophilicity of the front and back surfaces are adjusted. These materials facilitate formation of the carrier having surfaces with appropriate hydrophilicity, and are effective in satisfying the contact angle conditions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0047]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that when the hydrophilic fibrous base material of the resin stacked plate has an exposed surface ratio of 50% or more, the aforementioned contact angle conditions can be more surely satisfied. Particularly preferably, the exposed surface ratio of the fibrous base material is 50% or more on both the front surface and the back surface of the carrier <b>1</b>. Nevertheless, the present invention is not limited thereto as a matter of course. The exposed surface ratio of the fibrous base material can be adjusted at will depending on the fibrous base material and the resin to be employed, and so on. The aforementioned contact angle conditions should be satisfied in the end.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">In adjusting the exposed surface ratio of the hydrophilic fibrous base material within an appropriate range, the carrier can be polished for the adjustment under a more mechanical condition than that for actually polishing the wafer. For example, the polishing can be performed using foamed polyurethane pads as the polishing pads while a slurry containing silica abrasive grains is being supplied to thereby expose the fibrous base material.</div>
