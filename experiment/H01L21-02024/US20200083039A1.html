However, when polishing is performed at a high rotating speed under application of a high pressure, the polishing liquid is less likely to be supplied between the polishing cloth and the central portion of the surface of the silicon carbide substrate. Accordingly, the outer circumferential portion of the silicon carbide substrate is more likely to be polished as compared with the central portion of the silicon carbide substrate. As a result, the central portion of the silicon carbide substrate has a protruding shape, thus resulting in a deteriorated flatness. Moreover, since a sufficient amount of the polishing liquid is not supplied between the polishing cloth and the surface of the silicon carbide substrate, a larger number of surface scratches are produced, thus resulting in a deteriorated surface roughness.</div>

Further, it was confirmed that by polishing the silicon carbide substrate using such a polishing cloth having a low contact angle, the surface roughness can be reduced while improving the flatness of the silicon carbide substrate. As a result, it was confirmed that surface defects in the silicon carbide epitaxial layer formed on the silicon carbide substrate can be suppressed.</div>
