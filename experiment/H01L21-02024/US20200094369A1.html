<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes are widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits (IC). As an IC is built up layer by layer on the surface of a semiconductor wafer, CMP processes are used to polish or planarize the top most layer or layers to provide a leveled surface for subsequent fabrication steps. A CMP process is carried out by placing a wafer in a carrier (also called polish head) that presses the to-be-polished wafer surface against a polish pad attached to a platen. Both the platen and the wafer carrier are rotated while a CMP slurry containing abrasive particles and reactive chemicals is applied to the polishing pad. The slurry is transported to the wafer surface via the rotation of the porous polish pad. The relative movement of the polish pad and the wafer surface coupled with the reactive chemicals in the slurry allows the CMP process to level the wafer surface by means of physical and chemical forces.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">To improve the yield of CMP processes, within-wafer (WiW) uniformity needs to be accurately controlled. Further, with the device dimension continuously scaling down, final target control of a CMP process, i.e., the thickness of the leveled wafer surface, contributes as a key factor of device performance. As such, the wafer-to-wafer (WtW) uniformity also needs be accurately controlled.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">As critical dimensions of integrated circuits (IC) continuously shrink for each new technology node, more demanding requirements have been imposed on wafer planarity and depth of focus (DOF) limits. For example, with the gate-last high-K metal gate (HKMG) technology being adopted starting at the 45 nm technology node, the poly-open planarization (POP) and the replacement metal gate (RMG) planarization CMP process are introduced to the front end of line (FEOL) process flow. The POP and RMG CMP processes are critical because variations in the gate height lead to substantial transistor performance variations, e.g., the ON state current value variation. For example, in a RMG CMP process, the final target thickness (target) needs to be well controlled.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">At the same while, more varieties of devices and functions are integrated into ICs, the different devices and functions involve different materials, structures, and feature densities on the wafer surface to be polished, which pose additional challenges for CMP target and uniformity controls. Further, complicated CMP target control schemes also come with higher cost as additional process steps are added and consumables are increased.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present techniques identify multiple zones on a surface of a wafer. The multiple zones are identified based on the differences in the structure features within the relevant wafer surface areas. The structure features include, but are not limited to, the density or ratio of various metal features versus dielectric features, the relative sizes of the metal features and the dielectric features, the metal materials of the metal features, and/or whether or not a surface layer of a zone requires a further fabrication process before reaching the CMP target. The multiple zones may be identified with reference to structure features other than the listed examples. The structural features affect the polishing removal rate of the individual features in a CMP process and affect how the individual features change during the polishing process. Understanding the zone-specific CMP removal rates and effects is important because the erosion of dielectric features and/or the dishing of metal features all affect the wafer yield and the device performance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">For the WiW uniformity of a planarization operation, the multiple zones ultimately have a same or similar CMP target thickness, i.e., thickness of the wafer after the planarization operation. The current technique does not achieve the CMP target for all the zones through a single target control process. Instead, the technique includes a zone-based CMP target control with multiple stages of CMP processing, each stage of CMP processing achieving the CMP target for a zone or a group of zones, but not for the whole wafer. Each stage of the CMP process achieves a CMP target for a zone or a group of zones, referred to as “target zone” or “target zones,” but not all the zones. At each stage, the CMP process, e.g., the turntable rotary speed, the surface pressure, the slurry, the pad, and other parameters/conditions of conducting the CMP, is customized to have a higher polish rate for the features in the target zone, i.e., to be more effective in polishing the features in the target zones, and is configured to be selective to other zones that have not reached the CMP target. For other zones that have already reached the CMP target before the current target zones, the selective recipe works to minimize the impact of the CMP process of the target zone on such others zones. As a consequence, after the CMP stage of polishing the target zone, other zones have thickness values either substantially equal to the target zone or higher than the target zone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">The CMP target does not need to be the final target for the CMP operation. A CMP operation may include multiple targets for difference purposes. For example, a CMP operation may include a high-rate polishing target for a high polishing rate process to achieve WiW uniformity, a low-rate polishing target to achieve WtW uniformity, and a buffing target to improve the surface quality of the wafer, e.g., to remove surface defects and scratches that resulted from the low rate polishing and/or the high-rate polishing. The zone-based target control may be applied in one or more of the multiple targets. In an embodiment, the zone-based target control is used in a high-rate polishing of a wafer and after the high-rate polishing, the zones on the wafer surface are polished together in one or more of the low-rate polishing and/or the buffing polishing using an un-zoned target control, e.g., the target thickness is achieved for the whole surface of the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the multiple targets of the CMP operation are all controlled for each individual zone or individual group of zones separately in the stages of the CMP operation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The zone-specific CMP processes include one or more of mechanical components and chemical components. The mechanical components include, but are not limited to, the properties of the polishing pad, the pressure distribution on the back of the wafer, the rotation speed, the down-force on the wafer surface, and/or other mechanical parameters of the CMP process. The chemical components include the CMP slurry composition that is efficient in polishing the target zone with selectivity to other zones, e.g., other zones that have not reached the target.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">With the individualized target control for each zone or group of zones, a CMP stop layer is no longer needed, which saves dimension allowance for other features of a device. The WiW uniformity is improved as the CMP target is individually controlled for zones having different structure features. The overall CMP operation is simplified and the CMP consumables are reduced.</div>

For example, CMP stop layers are not needed, which saves space for more critical functional features. In accordance with the disclosed embodiments, target control for each zone is more accurate because of the uniformity of the structure features within each zone.
