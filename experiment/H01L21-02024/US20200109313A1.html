However, in lapping using diamond abrasive, defects and distortions are likely to occur due to the generation and remaining of scratches and the like. Therefore, after lapping using diamond abrasive or in place of the lapping, polishing in which a polishing pad is used and a polishing slurry is supplied between the polishing pad and a polishing object is studied.

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0006">In recent years, in a polishing composition used for polishing a surface of a polishing object such as silicon carbide, in order to reduce the number of dent defects such as scratches and latent defects that are not detected in morphological observation, there is a demand to use abrasive as little as possible. However, there is a problem of a polishing removal rate (an amount of a surface of a polishing object removed per unit time) decreasing if abrasive is not used. In this regard, in Patent Literature 1, in a polishing composition containing no abrasive, it has been proposed that a polishing removal rate is improved by devising components such as an oxidant. However, in such a technique, it is insufficient to meet a practically required level for a polishing removal rate and there is still room for improvement.</div>

Since it is thought that a polishing object is altered with an oxidant, and the altered layer is removed, and thus polishing proceeds, the polishing object is preferably a material that is not oxidized. Examples of a construction material of a polishing object include a monoelemental semiconductor or a monoelemental insulator such as silicon, germanium, and diamond; a ceramic material such as silicon nitride, tantalum nitride, and titanium carbide; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups IIB-VIB (Groups 12-16) compounds such as cadmium telluride, zinc selenide, cadmium sulfide, cadmium mercury telluride, and zinc cadmium telluride; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups IIIB-VB (Groups 13-15) compounds such as gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide, indium phosphide, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide nitride, and aluminum gallium indium phosphide; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups IVB-IVB (Groups 14-14) compounds such as silicon carbide, and germanium silicide; and the like. A polishing object made of a plurality of materials among them may be used. Among them, it is preferably used for polishing a material having a Vickers hardness of 500 Hv or higher. A Vickers hardness of a polishing target material is preferably 700 Hv or higher (for example 1,000 Hv or higher, typically 1,500 Hv or higher). The upper limit of the Vickers hardness is not particularly limited, and may be about 7,000 Hv or lower (for example, 5,000 Hv or lower, typically 3,000 Hv or lower). Herein, the Vickers hardness can be measured based on JIS R 1610:2003. The international standard corresponding to the JIS standard is ISO 14705:2000.</div>

In polishing, the oxidant causes a surface of a polishing target material (particularly, a surface of a material having a high hardness such as silicon carbide) to be altered, and the altered layer is removed due to friction with a polishing pad. While such a metal salt A need not be considered to be limited, it is thought that it exhibits a catalytic action for promoting the alteration and removal, and contributes to improvement of a polishing removal rate. Typically, the metal salt A preferably contains any one or two or more elements among lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba). Among them, any of Na, K, Ca, and Sr is preferable, and K or Ca is particularly preferable.</div>

Examples of the inorganic salt include salts of hydroharogenic acid (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and hydrofluoric acid), nitric acid, sulfuric acid, carbonic acid, silicic acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid and the like. In addition, examples of the organic salt include salts of carboxylic acid (for example, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid, glycine acid, butyric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, and trifluoroacetic acid), organic sulfonic acid (for example, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, and toluenesulfonic acid), organic phosphonic acid (for example, methyl phosphonic acid, benzene phosphonic acid, and toluene phosphonic acid), organic phosphoric acid (for example, ethyl phosphoric acid), and the like.

In a preferred embodiment, the metal salt A is a water-soluble salt. When the water-soluble metal salt A is used and a polishing composition contains substantially no solid component, a favorable surface with few defects, including, for example, dent defects such as scratches and latent defects that are not detected in morphological observation, can be efficiently formed. In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the metal salt A may be a salt that is dissolved in water and exhibits a neutral range (typically a normal salt that is generated by neutralization of a strong acid and a strong base). When the metal salt A in which an aqueous solution exhibits a neutral range (for example, pH 6 to 8, preferably, pH 6.5 to 7.5) is used, a high-quality surface in which the number of defects such as scratches is further reduced can be efficiently formed. Examples of the metal salt A in which an aqueous solution is neutral include chlorides such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and strontium chloride, and nitrates such as sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and strontium nitrate. Among them, calcium chloride, strontium chloride, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and strontium nitrate are preferable because a favorable surface can be efficiently formed.

When such an oxidant and the metal salt A are used in combination, it is possible to improve a polishing removal rate more effectively. The oxidant is not particularly limited as long as it is a substance having an oxidation-reduction potential sufficient to exhibit an action of oxidizing the surface of the polishing object. For example, the oxidant may be a substance having an oxidation-reduction potential higher than the oxidation-reduction potential of the polishing target material at a pH at which polishing is performed, that is, at the same pH as that of the polishing composition. Meanwhile, for example, the metal salt A may be a substance having an oxidation-reduction potential lower than the oxidation-reduction potential of the polishing target material at a pH at which polishing is performed, that is, at the same pH as that of the polishing composition. Here, for the oxidation-reduction potential of the polishing target material, a value obtained is adopted when powder of the material is dispersed in water to form a slurry, the slurry is adjusted to the same pH as that of the polishing composition, and an oxidation-reduction potential (an oxidation-reduction potential with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode at a liquid temperature of 25° C.) of the slurry is then measured using a commercially available oxidation-reduction potentiometer.</div>

The stock polishing step herein refers to a step of performing preliminary polishing on a polishing object. In a typical embodiment, the stock polishing step is a polishing step set immediately before the final polishing step. The stock polishing step may be a single-step of polishing or a polishing step in two or more sub-steps. The final polishing step herein refers to a step of performing final polishing on a polishing object on which stock polishing is performed and is a polishing step provided at the end (that is, on the most downstream side) among polishing steps performed using a polishing composition.

In addition, it was found that, in the polishing composition of Example 17, compared to Comparative Example 2, the number of defects observed under an AFM also decreased and latent defects that were not detected in morphological observation could be decreased. Based on the results, it was confirmed that, when the metal salt A and the oxidant were used in combination, the quality of the surface was improved with the polishing composition having a neutral pH range and a polishing removal rate could be significantly improved.</div>
