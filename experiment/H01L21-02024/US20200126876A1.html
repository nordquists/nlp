In this context, it is especially possible for multiple semiconductor wafers to be inserted into one or more “carrier plates” having recesses for the semiconductor wafers, and then to be polished by forces acting on both sides of the semiconductor wafers.

<li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">For the individual processing operations, it is possible to use suitable processing apparatuses. A useful first polishing apparatus for the first polishing operation is, for example, one having an upper polishing plate and a lower polishing plate, each rotatable about a common axis of rotation, and rotor disks arranged between the upper and lower polishing plates to accommodate semiconductor wafers. The faces of the upper and lower polishing plates facing the semiconductor wafers may each be aligned planar and parallel to one another. A polishing pad may have been applied to each of the faces of the upper and lower polishing plates facing the semiconductor wafers. In general, it is customary here to process or polish multiple semiconductor wafers in one run in such a polishing operation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">For the second polishing operation, an example of a useful second polishing apparatus is one having a polishing plate with a polishing pad disposed thereon. In addition, a carrier may be provided, with which a force can be applied to a semiconductor wafer lying on the polishing pad. The semiconductor wafer can be moved here along the polishing pad by means of the carrier, which can especially rotate about its own central axis. It is possible here to add a suitable polishing medium or a polishing medium suspension. In such a polishing operation, typically just a single semiconductor wafer is processed or polished in one run.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">For the coating operation, an example of a useful coating apparatus, especially an epitaxial reactor, is one in which a semiconductor wafer can be applied to a susceptor. A deposition gas can then be passed through the coating apparatus for coating of the semiconductor wafer. In addition, before passing deposition gas through, an etching gas can be passed through the coating apparatus in order to remove any deposits in the coating apparatus. In such a coating operation, it is entirely customary to coat just a single semiconductor wafer in one run.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Between, before or after these three processing operations, it is also possible for further processing operations to take place, but these have at least no significant effect, if any, on the flatness of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">What is now envisaged in accordance with the invention is that, in order that at least one wafer parameter is within a desirable range of values after undergoing all three processing operations, at least two operating parameters belonging to different processing operations are defined dependently on one another.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">More particularly, this can also be accomplished indirectly in that, in at least one of the processing operations, at least one corresponding operating parameter is defined based on a value of at least one wafer parameter after undergoing at least one of the other processing operations, where this wafer parameter in turn depends on at least one operating parameter of this other processing operation. In this way, the exact dependence of the operating parameters on one another can be obtained by, for example, measuring the wafer parameter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">Operating parameters to be considered here are especially various quantities which can be established in the respective processing operation. These may, for example, be pressures or a pressure distribution in a polishing operation or a volume or mass flow rate of deposition gas or etching gas in the coating operation. Especially in the second polishing operation, the pressure distribution may comprise different pressures for various radii of the semiconductor wafer, as will be elucidated in detail below. In both polishing operations, in addition, speeds of rotation and/or polishing times can also be established.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">A wafer parameter is understood to mean a parameter or a quantity which can be used to assess a semiconductor wafer, especially with regard to its quality. For examples of such wafer parameters, reference is made to the elucidations which follow.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">It was recognized that, by taking account of interactions between the various processing operations, it is possible to achieve distinctly better results, especially with regard to the flatness of the semiconductor wafers, than in the case of optimization of every individual processing operation on its own. This is especially attributable to the fact that a consideration of interactions between various processing operations especially also includes ranges for operating parameters in the individual processing operations that would not be taken into account in the individual processing operation in themselves owing to significant deviations from the process optimum. For example, in the case of the second polishing operation, greater removal of material at the outer edge of a semiconductor wafer can be accepted or else deliberately established if higher application of material to the semiconductor wafer at the outer edge is to be expected or can be deliberately established in the later coating operation. It is also possible to define an operating parameter depending on a desired value of the at least one wafer parameter after a subsequent processing operation, as will be elucidated later on. In that case, the result of a polishing operation will, for example, no longer be that the semiconductor wafer has maximum flatness, but that it constitutes a good starting material for the subsequent processing operation, but if appropriate with a desirable profile.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">It is likewise possible to take account of the circumstance that arises in the coating operation that material is deposited at different speeds in the edge region depending on the polar angle. For example, an epitaxial layer of monocrystalline silicon grows more quickly at polar angle positions of 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° than at polar angle positions offset by 45° relative to the positions mentioned on a {100}-oriented semiconductor wafer of monocrystalline silicon having an orientation notch that indicates a &lt;110&gt; direction. The 0° position denotes the notch position. The thickness of the coated semiconductor wafer is therefore greater in four regions of the circumference at equal distances from one another than in the regions in between (called fourfold symmetry).</div>

In principle, therefore, ESFQR<sub>max </sub>and SFQR<sub>max</sub>, for example, are suitable as wafer parameters to be determined. Preferably, the wafer parameter to be determined has the property that the magnitude and sign of the deviation from a reference, for example a reference plane or a reference line, can be taken therefrom. For this reason, ESFQD<sub>av </sub>is preferably chosen as the wafer parameter to be determined. The acronym ESFQD stands for “Edge Site Frontsurface-referenced least sQuares/Deviation”, and the index av denotes the average of the ESFQD values of edge sites in the circumferential region of the semiconductor wafer. Typically, the circumferential region comprises 72 sites of this kind (sectors).</div>

The invention also provides a semiconductor wafer of this kind, especially in the form of a monocrystalline silicon wafer with an epitaxial layer of monocrystalline silicon.

The front side is that side coated with an epitaxial layer. SFQR stands for “Site Frontsurface-referenced least sQuares/Range”, and the value thereof indicates the flatness of the semiconductor wafer. SFQR<sub>max </sub>denotes the greatest SFQR value of sites that are not edge sites. More particularly, this correlates positive and negative deviations of a surface from a flat reference surface. In general, the deviations are each used for the calculation for an area having particular dimensions at the surface of the semiconductor wafer. ESFQR stands for “Edge Site Frontsurface-referenced least sQuares/Range”, and the value thereof is defined as for the SFQR value, but only for edge sites of the semiconductor wafer. ESFQR<sub>max </sub>denotes the greatest ESFQR value of the edge sites. GBIR stands for “Global Backside Indicated Reading”.

In the case of simultaneous processing of multiple wafers, by contrast, an evaluation (according to the situation) (for example average, inter- and/or extrapolation) based on a multitude of semiconductor wafers is especially also an option.

The wafer parameter that has been determined again is then also taken into account when the task at hand is to define the at least one corresponding operating parameter for the processing of a subsequent semiconductor wafer in the respective processing operation. The basis of the definition of the at least one operating parameter may also be a wafer parameter which has been determined using a number of previously processed semiconductor wafers.

This can be accomplished in each case especially by defining and applying different pressures onto the regions of the semiconductor wafer. Such different pressures can be generated, for example, by a suitably designed carrier (or polishing ram) of the corresponding processing apparatus, by means of which the pressure is exerted on the semiconductor wafer.
