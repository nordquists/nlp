</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0027">The reason why such an effect is exhibited is speculated, for example, to be as follows. That is, the water-soluble polymer exhibits a substrate surface protecting effect during polishing. Therefore, the flatness after polishing can be increased or surface defects can be reduced using the stock polishing solution containing the water-soluble polymer, but the polishing removal rate is likely to decrease. In addition, since abrasive with a large diameter have a higher mechanical removal ability than abrasive with a small diameter, the surface of the substrate is efficiently ground using the abrasive with a large diameter, and on the other hand, the surface flatness after polishing tends to decrease and surface defects tend to increase. In the technology disclosed here, during polishing in the stock polishing step, the stock polishing solution supplied to a polishing object is sequentially switched from the first polishing solution to the second polishing solution and the third polishing solution. Since the first polishing solution has a small content of the water-soluble polymer and contains abrasive with a large diameter, greatly grinding the surface of the substrate contributes to shortening a polishing time. Since the second polishing solution has a larger content of the water-soluble polymer than the first polishing solution and contains abrasive with a large diameter, the surface which is greatly ground due to polishing with the first polishing solution is appropriately ground and the shape is adjusted and thus it contributes to improving the surface flatness. Since the third polishing solution contains a larger content of the water-soluble polymer than the second polishing solution and contains abrasive with a small diameter or does not contain abrasive, the water-soluble polymer is appropriately adsorbed to the surface of which the shape is adjusted due to polishing of the second polishing solution, and the surface is protected, and thus if contributes to reducing surface defects. Therefore, it is thought that when the first polishing solution, the second polishing solution, and the third polishing solution that satisfy the relationship are supplied in this order, in the stock polishing step, improvement in surface flatness and reduction in surface defects are achieved in a Shorter polishing removal time. In addition, when these stock polishing solutions are supplied to a same platen in a switching manner, it is possible to avoid complicated operations and complicated facilities, and the stock polishing step using the stock polishing solutions of a plurality of types can be performed with high efficiency. Hereinafter, the configuration of the stock polishing solutions will be described in more detail.</div>

In Examples 1 to 8 in which the stock polishing step including three stock polishing sub-steps was performed, high quality surfaces having a short polishing removal time, higher flatness and fewer defects were obtained with high efficiency. On the other band, in all of Comparative examples 1 to 4 in which the stock polishing step including two stock polishing sub-steps was performed, it was confirmed that the balance between improvement in flatness, reduction in surface defects, and shortening a polishing removal time was insufficient.
