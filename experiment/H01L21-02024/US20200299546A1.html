<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The surface of a material to be polished such as diamond, sapphire (aluminum oxide), silicon carbide, boron carbide, tungsten carbide, silicon nitride, and titanium nitride is generally processed by polishing (lapping) that is performed by supplying diamond abrasive to a polishing platen. However, in lapping using diamond abrasive, defects and strains are likely to occur due to the generation and remaining of scratches and the like. Therefore, after lapping using diamond abrasive or in place of the lapping, polishing in which a polishing pad is used and a polishing slurry is supplied between the polishing pad and an object to be polished is studied. Examples of literature in which this type of the related art is disclosed include Patent Literature 1.</div>

Examples of a constituent material of an object to be polished include a monoelemental semiconductor or a monoelemental insulator such as silicon, germanium, and diamond; a ceramic material such as silicon nitride, tantalum nitride, and titanium carbide; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups II-VI compounds such as cadmium telluride, zinc selenide, cadmium sulfide, cadmium mercury telluride, and zinc cadmium telluride; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups III-V compounds such as gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide, indium phosphide, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide nitride, and aluminum gallium indium phosphide; a semiconductor substrate material of Groups IV-IV compounds such as silicon carbide, and germanium silicide; and the like. An object to be polished made of a plurality of materials among them may be used. Among them, it is preferably used for polishing a material having a Vickers hardness of 500 Hv or higher. A Vickers hardness of a material to be polished is preferably 700 Hv or higher (for example 1,000 Hv or higher, typically 1,500 Hv or higher). The upper limit of the Vickers hardness is not particularly limited, and may be about 7,000 Hv or lower (for example, 5,000 Hv or lower, typically 3,000 Hv or lower). Herein, the Vickers hardness can be measured based on JIS R 1610:2003. The international standard corresponding to the JIS standard is ISO 14705:2000.</div>

The polishing composition disclosed here can be preferably applied to a single crystal surface of the material that is mechanically and chemically stable. Among them, the surface of the object is preferably made of any of diamond, silicon carbide, and gallium nitride, and more preferably made of silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is expected to be a semiconductor substrate material having low power loss and excellent heat resistance and the like, and has a particularly large practical advantage of improving surface properties.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">The polishing composition disclosed here contains sodium metavanadate (NaVO<sub>3</sub>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and silica abrasive. The content C1 of sodium metavanadate is 0.7% to 3.5% by weight, the content C2 of hydrogen peroxide is 0.3% to 3% by weight, and the content C3 of the silica abrasive is 12% to 50% by weight. In this manner, when a combination of specific contents of sodium metavanadate, hydrogen peroxide, and silica abrasive is used, both a high polishing removal rate and excellent surface quality can be achieved at a high level.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The reason why such effects are obtained is inferred, for example, to be as follows. That is, in polishing using a polishing composition including sodium metavanadate, hydrogen peroxide, and silica abrasive, vanadate ions generated by ionization of sodium metavanadate receive oxygen from hydrogen peroxide to generate peroxovanadate ions, the peroxovanadate ions alter a surface of a material to be polished (for example, in the case of silicon carbide, oxidative cleavage of the Si—C bond), and the altered layer is mechanically removed by silica abrasive. According to a polishing composition having the above configuration, a combination of specific contents of sodium metavanadate, hydrogen peroxide, and silica abrasive is used, and thus a rate at which the surface of the material to be polished is altered due to sodium metavanadate and hydrogen peroxide and a rate at which the altered layer is scraped off by silica abrasive are appropriately balanced. Therefore, silica abrasive do not scrape the surface of the material to be polished before alteration or excessively cut the surface after alteration (thus, reducing the occurrence of polishing scratches such as scratching caused when an unaltered surface with high hardness is scraped off) and the surface is efficiently scraped off. This is thought to contribute to improvement in the polishing removal rate and the surface quality. However, the present invention is not interpreted to be limited to such reasons.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">The content C1 of sodium metavanadate in the polishing composition is about 0.7% by weight or more. In consideration of polishing removal rate and the like, the content C1 of sodium metavanadate is preferably 0.8% by weight or more, and more preferably 0.9% by weight or more. In some embodiments, the content C1 of sodium metavanadate may be, for example, 1.2% by weight or more, and typically 1.5% by weight or more. In addition, from the standpoint of achieving a balance between a polishing removal rate and surface quality at a high level and the like, the content C1 of sodium metavanadate is about 3.5% by weight or less. The content C1 of sodium metavanadate is preferably 3.2% by weight or less, and more preferably 3% by weight or less. In some embodiments, the content C1 of sodium metavanadate may be, for example, 2.5% by weight or less, and typically 2.2% by weight or less. In the art disclosed here, an embodiment in which the content C1 of sodium metavanadate in the polishing composition is 0.9% by weight or more and 3% by weight or less can be preferably performed. Sodium metavanadate is appropriate as a vanadate suitable for the object of the present invention because it has higher solubility in water than vanadates such as ammonium metavanadate and is homogeneously soluble in the polishing composition even if it has the above high concentration. In addition, since sodium metavanadate is less expensive than potassium metavanadate and the like, it is advantageous in consideration of cost.</div>

In the art disclosed here, an embodiment in which the content C2 of hydrogen peroxide in the polishing composition is 1.2% by weight or more and 2.7% by weight or less can be preferably performed.
