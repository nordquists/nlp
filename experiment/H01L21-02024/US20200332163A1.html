The substrates composed of these materials other than silicon withstand high voltages because of large band gaps as compared with the silicon substrate. The high-voltage resistance characteristics of the substrates composed of silicon carbide, gallium nitride, and so on are considered attributed to the denser arrangement of the constituent atoms than that of silicon.</div>

Silicon carbide and so on are particularly hard due to the dense atomic arrangement as stated above. For example, the Mohs hardness of silicon carbide and gallium nitride is about 9, and that of diamond is 10. However, if polished with diamond, such a hard substrate undergoes only mechanical polishing and tends to suffer a defect or distortion, making the resulting device less reliable.

<li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention will be described on the basis of its preferred embodiment, which relates to a polishing liquid containing permanganate ions and, in addition, a weak acid and a soluble salt thereof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">A permanganate ion (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) is supplied from a permanganate. Examples of the permanganate include alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, and an ammonium salt of per manganic acid. Preferred permanganates as a permanganate ion (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) source are alkali metal permanganates in terms of availability and improvement in polishing efficiency of the polishing liquid of the embodiment. Sodium permanganate and potassium permanganate are particularly preferred. The permanganates described may be used either individually or as a mixture of two or more thereof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">With the view of sufficiently enhancing the inhibitory effect on reduction of polishing rate, the concentration of the permanganate ions (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) in the polishing liquid is preferably 0.1 mass % or higher. The permanganate ion (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) concentration is more preferably 20.0 mass % or lower with a view to securing the safety in handling the polishing liquid and in view of the tendency of the polishing rate to plateau even if the concentration is more increased. From these considerations, the permanganate ion (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) concentration in the polishing liquid is preferably 0.1 to 20.0 mass %, more preferably 0.2 to 10 mass %, even more preferably 0.5 to 5 mass %. The permanganate ion (MnO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>) concentration can be measured by ion chromatography or absorptiometry. The term “concentration (or amount or content)” as used herein with respect to a component of a polishing liquid refers to the concentration (or amount or content) of the component in the polishing liquid before commencement of polishing unless otherwise specified.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The polishing liquid of the embodiment contains a weak acid and its soluble salt, whereby reduction in polishing rate is prevented, and a high polishing rate is retained even when the polishing liquid is used repeatedly for a long time. The inventors have investigated polishing of hard materials, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, with a polishing liquid containing permanganate ions and found that the polishing rate is high in the initial stage of polishing but drastically decreases with the progress of polishing and that this phenomenon is particularly conspicuous when the permanganate ion concentration is high. As a result of further study on a method for preventing such a drastic reduction of polishing rate, they have found that the drastic reduction in polishing rate is effectively prevented by the use of a weak acid and its soluble salt.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the term “weak acid” refers to an acid having a small acid dissociation constant pKa, preferably a pKa of 1.0 or greater at 25° C. In the case of a polybasic acid, the term “pKa” as used herein means a pKa1. The pKan (where n is any integer greater than one) of a polybasic acid for use in the invention is preferably 3.0 or greater. Examples of acids with a pKa of 1.0 or greater include organic acids having a carboxyl group, such as acetic acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, lauric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, and tartaric acid; and inorganic acids, such as boric acid, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrosulfuric acid. Among them organic acids having a carboxyl group are preferred. In particular, the effect of the combination of permanganate ions, a weak acid, and a soluble salt of the weak acid in preventing reduction of polishing rate in a prolonged polishing operation is particularly high when acetic acid, phosphoric acid, or forming acid is used. Inter alia, acetic acid is preferred in terms of cost and performance. These weak acids may be used either individually or in combination thereof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">The soluble salt of the weak acid is exemplified by a neutralization salt with a strong base, such as an alkali metal salt or an alkaline earth metal salt. An alkali metal salt is preferred from a viewpoint of availability and solubility. From the same viewpoint, a sodium salt and/or a potassium salt are more preferred. A sodium salt is the most preferred. These soluble salts may be used either individually or in combination. In the present embodiment, it is preferred for the soluble salt to have a solubility of at least 1.0 g, more preferably 10 g or more, per 100 mL of water at 25° C.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">It is not clear why incorporation of a weak acid and its soluble salt prevents drastic reduction in polishing rate, but the inventors believe that the reason for this may be as follows. When a polishing liquid containing permanganate ions but not containing a weak acid and its soluble salt is acidic, according as polishing proceeds, the surface being polished undergoes excessive oxidation by the permanganate ions. The oxidation reaction by the permanganate ions under an acidic condition is represented by ionic equation (1) below. Occurrence of the excessive oxidation reaction indicates that the equilibrium in ionic equation (1) suddenly shifts to the right.</div>

</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0023">The inventors considered that the drastic reduction in polishing rate is caused by the excessive occurrence of the reaction according to ionic equation (1) and intensively studied on a method for suppressing this phenomenon. The inventor surmised that the phenomenon would be suppressed by incorporating a weak acid and its soluble salt into a polishing liquid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0024">When a polishing liquid contains a weak acid and its soluble salt as well as permanganate ions, the following dissociation reactions take place in the polishing liquid. In the following ionic equations, HA is a weak acid; H<sup>+</sup> is a hydrogen ion; A<sup>−</sup> is the anion of the weak acid; BA is a soluble salt of the weak acid; and B<sup>+</sup> is the cation of the soluble salt.</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0000"> <br/>HA⇔H<sup>+</sup>+A<sup>−</sup>  (2)

</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0025">The dissociation of the weak acid HA as represented by equation (2) is usually suppressed because of the existence of a given amount of the A<sup>−</sup> ion in the polishing liquid as a result of the dissociation of the soluble salt BA as represented by equation (3). The inventors assumed that the permanganate ions would be prevented from excessively occurring by controlling the hydrogen ion quantity in the polishing liquid by the presence of a weak acid and its soluble salt. Based on this assumption, they actually performed polishing using a polishing liquid containing permanganate ions in the presence of a weak acid and its soluble salt and confirmed that the rise in pH of the polishing liquid was gradual with the progress of polishing and, at the same time, reduction in polishing rate is effectively prevented. When plotting pH of the polishing liquid as the ordinate and polishing time as the abscissa, in the case where the polishing liquid is acidic and contains neither a weak acid nor its soluble salt, the pH suddenly increases with time in the initial stage, and then the pH rise becomes gradual with further elapse of time. Thus, in that case, the plot of pH as ordinate and time as abscissa exhibits two straight line segments—a straight line segment steeply sloping upward up to pH 7 to 8 and a subsequent straight line segment gently sloping upward—connected via a kink.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0026">In contrast, on the condition that the initial pH is 6 or less, the pH of the polishing liquid of the embodiment rises with time at a gentle slope up to pH 7 to 8 and even thereafter shows little change in slope with further elapse of time as compared with a polishing liquid containing neither a weak acid nor a soluble salt thereof. That is, the slope of pH rise of the polishing liquid of the embodiment is gentler up to pH 7 to 8 and is less likely to change even thereafter with further elapse of polishing time than that of the polishing liquid containing neither a weak acid nor its soluble salt. Therefore, the polishing liquid of the embodiment shows an almost linear plot of pH change vs. time. The inventors have thus revealed that reduction in polishing rate is effectively prevented when the rise in pH is controlled to be gradual.</div>

The method of the invention is to provide a polished surface by polishing a substrate using the polishing liquid of the invention. The method of the invention is suitably applied to polishing a hard material with a Mohs hardness of 8 or higher. “Mohs hardness” is a numerical scratch resistance of minerals relative to reference minerals with assigned rankings 1 to 10 in ascending order of hardness: 1, talc; 2, gypsum; 3, calcite; 4, fluorite; 5, apatite; 6, orthoclase; 7, quartz; 8, topaz; 9, corundum; and 10, diamond. Mohs hardness can be measured using a Mohs scale in a usual manner. Hard materials with a Mohs hardness of 8 or higher are exemplified by silicon carbide, gallium nitride, and diamond. The method for producing a polished substrate of the invention is applicable to, for example, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) as a final polishing step following lapping of a hard material-based substrate. As used herein, the term “substrate” means an object to be polished, and the term “polished substrate” means an object obtained by polishing.</div>

In the embodiment, the used polishing liquid may be discharged as a waste but is preferably recovered and resupplied to the polishing pad in a recirculation system. The expression “a recirculation system” as used herein does not mean that the recovery and resupply cycle should be repeated more than once, and it suffices that the used polishing liquid be reused once. During the recirculation, the pH may be adjusted by the addition of an acid, etc., but the invention makes it possible to retain the polishing rate with no need to conduct such pH adjustment. The embodiment successfully prevents reduction in polishing rate even in such a recirculation system, thereby to achieve cost reduction without impairing the polishing efficiency. The polishing machine that can be used in the invention is selected from known and available polishers, either single side or double side. The polishing pad may be made of materials commonly used in the art, including nonwoven fabrics, nonwoven fabrics impregnated with resin (e.g., polyurethane or epoxy resin), and suede.

The pH (at 25° C.) of the polishing liquid before commencement of polishing was measured as an initial pH value, and the results are shown in Table 3. The buffering capacity of the polishing liquid was measured. The results of the buffering capacity measurement and the adjusted pH of the polishing liquid being tested are also shown in Table 3. Before the D<sub>50 </sub>measurement, the silica particles were dispersed by ultrasonication (30 W) for 3 minutes. The D<sub>50 </sub>measurement was taken using a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution analyzer Microtrac MT3300EX II from MicrotracBEL Corp. under conditions: transmissivity of particle, refractive; shape of particle, non-spherical; particle refractive index, 1.46; and solvent refractive index, 1.333.</div>
