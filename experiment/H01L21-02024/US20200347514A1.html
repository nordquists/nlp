Such group III nitride semiconductor device is produced by carrying out the crystal growth of the group III nitride semiconductor thin film on the single crystal substrate by vapor phase deposition methods such as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor deposition (MOCVD) method, Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) method, or Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) method or so. Among these, MOCVD method is most widely used industrially, because the thickness of the film can be controlled at atomic layer level, and also relatively high growth rate can be obtained.</div>

The aluminum nitride single crystal substrate obtained as such is usually processed into ultraflat surface by carrying out Chemical Mechanical Planarization or so which uses an abrasive such as colloidal silica or so against a surface of said substrate. As such, by making the substrates surface ultraflat, the aluminum gallium nitride layer (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N, 0≤x≤1) can be easily deposited on said substrate, and also those with high quality can be obtained.</div>

Also, such foreign matters are thought to be derived from the inorganic material such as a piece of ground substrate and abrasive used for polishing or so, and organic materials such as wax or so.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Here, the present inventors have carried out keen examination regarding the method of cleaning the substrate of after the polishing in order to remove said foreign matters. First, as the cleaning method of the semiconductor, a generally known cleaning by diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF cleaning), and a cleaning by a mixture solution of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution or so were examined, but the foreign matters were unable to be completely removed by such methods. Specifically, the foreign matters having certain size were removable relatively easily; however the fine foreign matters having the size of 1 μm or less were difficult to remove. The alkaline based cleaner disclosed in the patent document 2 is not designed for applying to the aluminum nitride single crystal substrate. The aluminum nitride single crystal is easily etched by alkaline; hence the alkaline cleaning may compromise the smoothness of the substrate surface. Particularly, N-polarity plane of the aluminum nitride single crystal is known to be rapidly etched by alkaline. Therefore, the alkaline cleaning of the aluminum nitride single crystal has not been considered at all.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the alkaline cleaning as mentioned in above is considered to be effective for removing the abrasive and organic matters or so which have remained. Thus, the cleaning of the aluminum nitride single crystal substrate surface using the alkaline based cleaning solution was examined, and it was found that as alkaline cleaning has certain degree of effect for removing fine foreign matters, however it still could not resolve the problem that the aluminum nitride single crystal face processed to have an ultraflat surface being etched by alkaline, further there were problems yet to be considered.</div>

First, the concentration of the alkaline based cleaning solution which was effective for removing the abrasive and the organic matters was examined, then it was found that by making the concentration of the alkaline to a certain concentration or below, the etching of the aluminum nitride single crystal substrate can be suppressed. However, just by immersing the substrate into such low alkaline aqueous solution, it was difficult to sufficiently remove said fine foreign matters. Thus, the combination of the physical means and the low alkaline aqueous solution was considered. First, after immersing into the low alkaline aqueous solution, a stimulus such as ultrasonic wave was applied, but it was difficult to remove said fine foreign matters by the ultrasonic wave having the frequency of 100 kHz or less. On the other hand, the effect of removing said fine foreign matters can be expected by a mega sonic cleaning using the ultrasonic wave having the frequency of more than 100 kHz for example of 1 MHz or more, however the device performed with the ultrasonic cleaning at high frequency is complicated to handle, and also it is disadvantageous from the point of costs, thus this was difficult to use industrially. Hence, as the physical means, the scrub cleaning which scrubs the surface of the substrate by porous materials or so including the cleaning solution was considered, then a specific effect for the foreign matter removal became apparent, thereby the present invention was attained.</div>

After the thermal cleaning, the temperature inside the reactor is set to the growing temperature of the aluminum gallium nitride layer. The growing temperature is 1050 to 1100° C., and preferably 1050 to 1090° C. or so; and by growing within this range, the aluminum gallium nitride layer having good crystallinity and smoothness can be obtained. After the reactor temperature reaches the above mentioned growing temperature, the source material gas which generates the aluminum gallium nitride is supplied in place of said mixed gas; thereby the aluminum gallium nitride layer is obtained. During the MOCVD method, the crystal growth condition such as the pressure inside the reactor, the type and flow amount of the source material gas and carrier gas or so are not particularly limited, and it may be determined accordingly depending on the mode of the reactor and the composition of the object aluminum gallium nitride layer. Although it is not to be limited in anyway, as the group III source material gas, trimethyl aluminum and trimethyl gallium or so may be used. Also, as the nitrogen source gas (a group V source material gas), ammonia may be mentioned. These source material gases may be introduced into the MOCVD reactor together with hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas which are the carrier gas. Note that, ammonia has a strong effect to etch the substrate surface, thus it is preferably introduced at the same time with the group III source material gas, or after the supply has started. The supply ratio of these source material gases (V/III ratio) may be determined accordingly depending on the composition of the aluminum gallium nitride layer of the object. In order to obtain the n-type aluminum gallium nitride layer, a dopant source material gas including Si element such as monosilane or tetraethylsilane or so may be supplied together with the group III source material gas and nitrogen source gas.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036">When the cleaning of the aluminum nitride single crystal substrate surface polished to have ultraflat surface by CMP or so is insufficient, the foreign matters having the size of 1 μm or less which has remained are firmly adhered to the substrate surface. Therefore, if these still remain even after the thermal cleaning, during the MOCVD step, numerous crystal defects due to the lattice mismatch will be generated while growing the aluminum gallium nitride layer, and this caused difficulty to grow good single crystal layer. By removing the foreign matters having the size of 1 μm or less from the substrate surface according to the cleaning method of the present invention, a good aluminum gallium nitride layer (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N, 0≤x≤1) having the film thickness exceeding 1 μm can be obtained stably.</div>

The mixing ratio of the mixed gas under the standard condition was 76 vol % of hydrogen gas and 24 vol % of nitrogen gas; and the total flow amount of the mixed gas was 8.5 slm. After the pressure is reduced, the temperature inside the reactor was increased to 1210° C. in 8 minutes, and maintained at 1210° C. for 10 minutes, and then the temperature was changed to 1070° C. and the pressure to 50 mbar in 1 minute. Then, the nitrogen gas was blocked in 1 minute so that the hydrogen gas was the only gas flowing inside the reactor. Then, 80 sccm of trimethyl aluminum, 5 sccm of trimethyl gallium and 1.2 sccm of tetraethyl silane, and 1500 sccm of ammonia were introduced to the reactor, then the n-type Al<sub>0.7</sub>Ga<sub>0.3</sub>N was grown at the pressure for 50 mbar and the reactor temperature of 1070° C. By going through the above mentioned steps, the laminated body was obtained wherein the n-type Al<sub>0.7</sub>Ga<sub>0.3</sub>N layer (Si concentration of 1.0×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or so) having the film thickness of 1.2 μm was provided on the aluminum nitride single crystal substrate.</div>
