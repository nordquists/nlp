<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">A polishing process called chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is widely used as a technique for smoothing a silicon wafer (hereinafter simply referred to as a wafer). A polishing composition containing fine abrasive particles and a basic compound is used in CMP. In the CMP process, mechanical polishing with such an abrasive and chemical polishing with a basic compound proceed simultaneously, and thus a wide range of surface of a wafer can be smoothed with high precision.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, in a wafer polishing process according to CMP, 3- to 4-step polishing is performed to realize high precision smoothing. In the first half of the polishing process, mainly for rough polishing, a high polishing removal rate tends to be required. On the other hand, the latter half of the polishing process is mainly for finishing the wafer to have a smoother surface with higher quality. A method using a polishing composition containing a water-soluble polymer is known as a method for obtaining a highly smooth surface (Patent Document 1 to 3).</div>

Examples of polymers including an oxyalkylene unit include random copolymers and block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and polyethylene glycol. Here, the vinyl alcohol-based polymer is a polymer having a structural part represented by the following chemical formula: —CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(OH)—; as a repeating unit (hereinafter referred to as a VA unit) constituting the polymer. The VA unit can be produced by, for example, hydrolysis (also referred to as saponification) of a repeating unit of a structure obtained by vinyl polymerization of a vinyl ester type monomer such as vinyl acetate. A polymer generally called as a polyvinyl alcohol is encompassed in the concept of the vinyl alcohol-based polymer disclosed herein. The degree of saponification of the polyvinyl alcohol can be, for example, about 93% to 99%, but is not particularly limited. In addition, a polymer having a non-vinyl alcohol unit (hereinafter referred to as a non-VA unit) in addition to the VA unit can be used as a vinyl alcohol-based polymer disclosed herein.

For example, the amount of the reaction product with respect to the water-soluble polymer tends to be reduced by reducing the amount of a polymerization initiator used, using a polymerization initiator with a higher decomposition rate, using monomers with a lower content of a polymerization inhibitor or monomers that have been subjected to a purification treatment for removing a part or all of the polymerization inhibitor immediately before use, synthesis of a water-soluble polymer at a lower concentration (that is, using a large amount of a polymerization solvent), synthesis of a water-soluble polymer which more strictly excludes the incorporation of oxygen and contact with oxygen, reducing a polymerization temperature, shortening a polymerization time, by performing a treatment for decomposing the polymerization initiator remaining after polymerization by heating and/or elapse of time, or purifying a water-soluble polymer by reprecipitation or the like.
