<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the production of a semiconductor wafer such as a silicon wafer, which is a typical example of a work to be polished, in order to obtain a wafer having flatness quality or surface smoothness quality controlled with higher precision, a double-side polishing process is typically used, by which front and back surfaces of the wafer are polished simultaneously.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Especially in recent years, since semiconductor devices have been miniaturized and the diameter of semiconductor wafers has been increased, the flatness required of semiconductor wafers during light exposure has become more severe. Given this background, there is a strong need for a technique for terminating polishing in a timely manner.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In typical double-side polishing, in an initial stage of polishing, the whole surface of a wafer has an upward convex shape, and the wafer greatly sags at the periphery as well. Here, the thickness of the wafer is sufficiently larger than the thickness of a carrier plate. Next, as the polishing proceeds, the whole surface of the wafer becomes flatter; however, the periphery of the wafer remains sagging. Here, the thickness of the wafer is slightly larger than the thickness of the carrier plate. As the polishing proceeds further, the wafer becomes almost flat and the periphery of the wafer comes to be less sagging. Here, the thickness of the wafer is almost the same as the thickness of the carrier plate. After that, as the polishing proceeds, the shape of the wafer is gradually depressed at the center, and the periphery of the wafer comes to have a raised shape. At this point, the thickness of the wafer is smaller than the thickness of the carrier plate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, in order to obtain a wafer having high flatness over the whole surface and the periphery, wafers have been typically polished so that the wafers would have almost the same thickness as the carrier plate, and an operator has controlled the polishing time to control the amount of polishing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the adjustment of the polishing time performed by an operator has been significantly affected by polishing conditions such as the replacement period for the secondary materials for polishing and the differences in timing of the deactivation of an apparatus. Accordingly, the amount of polishing cannot always have been controlled accurately, so it has largely relied on the experience of the operator.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, for example, JP 2010-030019 A (PTL 1) proposes a double-side polishing apparatus for wafers, by which the thickness of a wafer being polished is measured in real time through monitoring holes (through holes) above an upper plate (or below a lower plate), and the timing of termination of the polishing can be evaluated based on the result of the measurement.</div>

The inventors of this disclosure found that when timing of terminating double-side polishing of the wafers W is determined, the deviation of the shape described above can be reduced by correcting the set value of the shape index of the wafers W corresponding to the timing of termination of double-side polishing in the current batch based on the difference between the actual value and the target value of the shape index of the wafers W having been double-side polished in the previous batch.</div>

Further, the adjustment sensitivity constant α is a constant for adjusting the effect of the actual value of the shape index in the previous batch in determining a set value of the shape index of the wafers W in the current batch. The constant α is set to be a value larger than 0 and 1 or smaller, thereby reducing the effect of measurement errors concerning the actual value due to the disturbance caused by the life variation of the secondary materials such as the polishing pads <b>7</b>, carrier plate <b>9</b>, and slurry at the time of measurement of the shape index of the wafers in the previous batch.
