<div class="description-paragraph">Us. or. 51-298 ABSTRACT on THE DISCLOSURE This invention relates to a permanent suspension of abrasive polishing powders. The suspension media consists essentially of a glycol base thickened by a neutralized carboxy polymethylene polymer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">. This invention relates to abrasive polishing suspensions and, more particularly, to permanent suspensions of powdered abrasive materials in a nonaqueous or partially aqueous glycol base. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Abrasive polishing materials have been suspended in various water base solutions. These presently available suspensions are not permanent suspensions because the abrasive particles will settle out and cake at the bottom of the container. Further, water base suspensions have a high evaporation rate which requires periodic additions of fluid to maintain the properties of the polishing compound while on a lap. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It now has been'discovered that permanent suspensions of abrasive polishing powder can be achieved by utilizing a suspension media which contains non-aqueous or partially aqueous glycol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In accordance with the invention, it has been discovered that the glycol base suspension media can be made to permanently suspend abrasive powdered particles so that they will not settle out or cake at the bottom of the container as is the case with presently available metallographic and semi-conductor polishing formulations. Further, the suspending media has anti-drying properties due to the low vapor pressure of the glycol base. The evaporamm rate is minimized and periodic additions of fluid are not required to maintain the properties of the polishing compound While on the lap. Another factor contributing to the anti-drying properties, of the suspensions of the present invention, is the high hygroscopicity of the glycol family of compounds. For example, at 80 F. and 60% relatively humidity a 50% aqueous solution of ethylene glycol would lose through evaporation a maximum of of its water. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 'Another advantageof the suspensions of this invention is that glycol base suspensions are completely soluble in water and are soluble in many organic materials normally insoluble in Water. This is an advantage over oil based lapping compounds. Further, suspensions made from glycol based formulations have a much broader useful temperature range. A' pure ethylene glycol base would be liquid from 12 C. to 200 C., over twice the range of pure water. Also, since glycols reduce surface tension in aqueous systems, they provide superior wetting properties by their presence in the polishing suspensions. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Accordingly, the present invention is predicated on the use of various glycols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, but preferably ethylene glycol alone or in combination with each other and/or water. To the glycol base is added a carboxy polymethylene polymer of high molecular weight to thicken the suspension and produce a permanent suspension of abrasive particles in the glycol or glycol water base. Suspensions made according to the invention have a shelf life exceeding one yearwithout settling of abrasive powder particles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3,817,727 Patented June 18, 1974 ice  Any polishing agent can be suspended by the method of this invention. Typical powders are aluminum oxide powders having an unagglomerated average of particle size in the range of from about .05 to 1.0 microns, sold by Union Carbide Corporation under the trade name'Linde Type A, B or C. Other powders could be, for example, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' silicon carbide, beach sand, etc. Suspensions of these and other powders will be illustrated in the example given herein below by way of illustrating the scope and spirit of the invention. 9 Y J According to the invention, the suspensions are made by blending a carboxy polymethylene polymer of high molecular weight, such as the type sold by B. F. Goodrich Chemical Co. under the trade name Carbopol 941 into ethylene glycol. The Carbopol 941 is supplied as dry, fluflz'y powders in acid form requiring neutralization to develop optimum properties. Carbopol 941, as described in Service Bulletin GC36 (Revised) of The B. F. Goodrich Chemical Company, is a commercially available water-soluble carboxy vinyl polymer resin having the following properties Physical properties Appearance: Flufly, white acid powder Bulk density: 13 pounds per cubic foot (approximate) Specific gravity: 1.41 Moisture content as shipped: 2% maximum Equilibrium moisture content, room temperature, at </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> relative humidity: 8% pH of 1% water solution: 3 </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> Having described the invention in general terms, the following examples are provided to illustrate the various forms the invention may take and the methods for achieving the permanent suspensions of the invention: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">EXAMPLE I 1.0 gram of Carbopol 941 resin was blended into 400 cc. ethylene glycol. After allowing the mixture to soak for several minutes, 10 cc. of a 25% aqueous solution of diisopropanolamine was blended with the Carbopol/ glycol mixture to neutralize the Carbopol and form a thick mucilage. In another blender 150 grams of Linde A (0.3a) alumina polishing powder was dispersed in another 400 cc. of ethylene glycol. Twenty drops ofred dye were added for coloring. This alumina dispersion was quickly poured into the previously prepared Carbopol mucilage in the first blender and thoroughly blended into the mucilage. A permanent pink suspension of Linde A in ethylene glycol resulted. The composition of the suspension was as follows: </div>

In another blender 150 grams of Linde A alumina powder were dispersed in 400 cc. of water. Twenty drops of red dye were added to this dispersion. The alumina/water mixture was quickly transferred to the Carbopol mucilage in the first blender and thoroughly blended with the mucilage.

EXAMPLE V Identical procedure to Example III, except l QOgrams of Linde B (0.05m alumina polishing powder and blue dye were used inplace of Linde A and red dye. A per-- manent blue suspension of Linde B resulted. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">EXAMPLE VI Identical ingredients and procedure to Example V, except that 4.0 cc. of a 10% aqueous NaOH solution were used to neutralize Carbopol instead of diisopropanolamine. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' EXAMPLE VII 21 grams of Carbopol 941 were dispersed in one quart of deionized water. This unneutralized Carbopol mucilage was then blended into two gallons of ethylene glycol in a 24 quart steel tank with a ,6 hp. model 8A Eastern mixer with a 5 /2" diameter propeller running at 725 r.p.m. In a separate 12 quart tank, 6% lbs. of Linde C powder were dispersed in two gallons of deionized water using a hp. model SVA Eastern mixer with a 3" diameter propeller. 15 cc. of yellow dye were added to this mixture. The ethylene glycol/carbopol mixture in the large tank was then neutralized with 200 cc. of aqueous diisopropanolamine. The Linde C dispersion was then added quickly to the large tank containing the mucilage and the entire mixture was blended to 10-15 minutes using the Model 8A Eastern mixer previously mentioned. </div>

This alumina dispersion was quickly poured into the previously prepared Carbopol mucilage in the first blender and thoroughly blended into the mucilage. A permanent yellow suspension of Linde C in propylene glycol resulted. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Example I and XXIII illustrate the use of two nonaqueous glycol formulations using the lowest molecular weight members of two families of glycols, the ethylene glycols and propylene glycols. Examples XIX through XXI illustrate the use of higher order ethylene glycols in a water/ glycol formulation. It is a reasonable assumption that the higher molecular weight polyethylene glycols of the form HOCH (CH -O-CH ),,CI-I -OH would form successful suspensions, both aqueous and non-aqueous, for higher values of n than have been attempted in the examples listed. This would especially be true for n up to 7, which glycols are still liquid at ambient conditions. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Examples HI through V are the preferred formulations of this invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> All of the previous examples have utilized only a slight excess of neutralizing agent leaving the suspensions in a neutral or slightly alkaline invironment with pH lower than 10. All of the neutralizing agents for Car-bopol resins are bases, either organic such as diisopropanolamine used throughout most of the examples, or inorganic such as NaOH in Example VI. Other bases which will neutralize Carbopol resins in the ethylene glycol/water system are ammonium hydroxide, triethanolamine, monoethanolamine, triethylamine, and Ethomeen C-25. Diisopropanolamine has been found to be the most eflicient neutralizing agent in the present systems and is the preferred agent. An advantage of the suspensions made using this preferred organic base is that there are no inorganic ions, such as Na, present to any extent. Ions such as sodium are very deleterious to polished semi-conductor substrates. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> For some applications, however, it is advantageous to have either a high or low pH or an ionic system. The properties of the Carbopol suspension are'unatfected over a pH range of 3 to 12, however, the adjustment of pH and addition of inorganic additives must be made after the Carbopol has been neutralized completely with the neutralizing agent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The Carbopol 941 is preferred in these formulations over the other Carbopol resins due to its ability to form relatively low viscosities in ionic systems. The other Carbopol resins are used to provide much thicker emulsions and suspensions. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Applications for these alumina suspensions are as widespread as the powders from which they are formed. They can be used in essentially all polishing operations which now use the alumina powders, with the new advantage of being easier to handle than the powder counterpart. Being viscous, they remain on the laps longer than a similar water slurry, and they are much less susceptible to drying on the lap. Since they are chemically neutral, they will not corrode laps as will some of the other formulations on the market. </div>
