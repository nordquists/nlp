<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES66043146">
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a polishing composition to smooth the surface of wafers which are widely used as supporting crystals for integrated circuits. More particularly, it relates to a fine polishing composition to smooth the surface of wafers to remove irregularities exceeding 10 mμm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Wafers widely used as supporting crystals for integrated circuits, are usually prepared by slicing an ingot of silicon or germanium crystal, and their surface is then polished to form a flat surface free from irregularities as far as possible before formation of integrated circuit thereon. If irregularities are present on the wafer surface, it is difficult to form a circuit pattern precisely and finely on the surface, and such irregularities tend to lead to non-uniformity of the electric characteristics of the wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heretofore, various polishing agents have been proposed to polish the surface of such wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,170,273 discloses a silica sol having a silica concentration of from 2 to 50% by weight and a silica gel having a silica concentration of from 2 to 100%, as polishing agents. U.S. Pat. No. 3,328,141 discloses that an alkaline compound is added to such polishing agents to adjust the pH to a level of from 10.5 to 12.5, whereby the polishing rate can be increased. However, the wafer surface polished with these polishing agents, still has irregularities of from 5 to 50 mμm when observed by a differential interference microscope and thus is not fully satisfactory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 9910/1978 discloses a polishing agent comprising quartz, a silicate and a hexafluorosilicate, which further contains a monovalent alcohol having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms and a polyvinyl alcohol. However, no adequately satisfactorily polished surface can be obtained even with this polishing agent. Besides, such a polishing agent containing an alcohol has a difficulty in the storage stability for a long period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,260,396 discloses a polishing agent containing water-soluble carboxymethylene gum or xanthane gum. However, such a polishing agent has a drawback that it takes a long polishing time to obtain a smooth polished surface and requires a long period of time for so-called rinse polishing conducted after polishing while supplying washing water. Further, it has a drawback that microorganisms utilizing xanthane gum as a nutrient source are likely to grow in the polishing agent, whereby it is difficult to maintain the storage stability for a long period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is an object of the present invention to overcome such drawbacks inherent to the conventional polishing compositions and to accomplish the following objectives:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) To provide a polishing agent which is, when used for polishing a wafer, capable of providing a polished surface having no irregularities observable even by a differential interference microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) To provide a polishing agent which requires only a short period of time for providing a smooth surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) To provide a polishing agent which requires only a short period of time for rinse polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) To provide a polishing agent having good storage stability for a long period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present inventors have conducted extensive research to accomplish the above objectives and as a result, have found it possible to accomplish such objectives by providing a composition having a polysaccharide polymer graft-polymerized with a certain specific vinyl monomer incorporated in a slurry containing particulate amorphous silica and having the pH adjusted to a specific range with an alkaline substance, or by providing a composition obtained by incorporating a certain specific water-soluble salt to the above composition. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these discoveries. According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a fine polishing composition for wafers, comprising water, particulate amorphous silica and a polysaccharide polymer graft-polymerized with acrylamide alone or together with at least one vinyl monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and styrenesulfonic acid, and adjusted with an alkaline substance to a pH of from 8 to 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a fine polishing composition for wafers, comprising water, particulate amorphous silica, a polysaccharide polymer graft-polymerized with acrylamide alone or together with at least one vinyl monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and styrenesulfonic acid, and a water-soluble salt, and adjusted with an alkaline substance to a pH of from 8 to 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the particulate amorphous silica to be used in the present invention, colloidal silica sol or silica powder may be mentioned. It may be used in the form of an aqueous slurry wherein colloidal silica sol or silica powder is suspended in water, or in such a form that is capable of forming a slurry when added to water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such particulate amorphous silica usually has an average particle size within a range of from 5 mμm to 10 μm. If the average particle size is less than 5 mμm, the proportion of the silicic acid monomer or oligomer in the particles tends to be large, and if such particles are used for polishing, the silicic monomer or oligomer tends to deposit in the form of silica on the wafer surface, such being undesirable. If the average particle size exceeds 10 μm, the wafer surface tends to be susceptible to scratching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the average particle size means an average particle size of independent particles when such particles are present in a separated state without coagulation, or an average particle size of coagulates when particles are present in a coagulated state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the particulate amorphous silica in the fine polishing composition for wafers according to the present invention, is usually at least 0.1% by weight. If the content is too small, no adequate effects will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, as the polysaccharide polymer, gua gum or xanthane gum may, for example, be mentioned. Gua gum is meant for viscous galactomannan contained in the albumen of seeds of gua which is a leguminous plant, and xanthane gum is meant for a polymer polysaccharide obtained by pure cultivation and fermentation of Xanthomonas campestris.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fine polishing composition for wafers according to the present invention, contains a graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer obtained by graft-polymerizing to the above-mentioned polysaccharide polymer an acrylamide monomer or a comonomer mixture composed of an acrylamide monomer and at least one vinyl monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and styrenesulfonic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the graft-polymerization of the acrylamide monomer alone or together with other specific vinyl monomer to the above-mentioned polysaccharide polymer, it is possible to obtain a graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer having high resistance against biochemical decomposition due to microorganisms without sacrificing the water-solubility of the polysaccharide polymer. The graft polymerization reaction of the polysaccharide polymer with the acrylamide monomer alone or together with other specific vinyl monomer proceeds efficiently and is therefore advantageous from the industrial point of view.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the polishing composition containing such a graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer is far superior in drag reduction effect to the polishing composition containing the non-graft polymerized polysaccharide polymer. The drag reduction effect is an effect whereby a turbulent flow hardly takes place even under a condition where the Reynolds number of the fluid is high. The drag reduction effect of the polishing composition of the present invention is high. This means that even when used for polishing under high pressure, the polishing composition maintains laminar flow and hardly forms a turbulent flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Acrylamide may be graft-polymerized to the polysaccharide polymer in accordance with a method described in detail, for example, in Journal of Applied Polymer Science Vol. 30, 4013-4018 (1985) and ditto, Vol. 32, 6163-6176 (1986). For example, when acrylamide is graft-polymerized to gua gum or xanthane gum, from 1 mmol to 1 mol of acrylamide and from 1 μmol to 10 mmol of a polymerization initiator are added per g of gua gum or xanthane gum to an aqueous solution containing from 0.01 to 2.0% by weight of gua gum or xanthane gum, and the mixture is reacted at a temperature of from 0° to 100° C. in air or in the presence of an inert gas. As the polymerization initiator, a cerium ion type radical is preferably employed. Further, gua gum or xanthane gum is preferably of high purity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The graft-polymerization of the above vinyl monomer and acrylamide to the polysaccharide polymer may be conducted as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, when the above-mentioned vinyl monomer and acrylamide are graft-polymerized to gua gum or xanthane gum, from 1 mmol to 1 mol of the above vinyl monomer, from 1 mmol to 1 mol of acrylamide and from 1 μmol to 10 mmol of a polymerization initiator are added per g of gua gum or xanthane gum to an aqueous solution containing from 0.01 to 2.0% by weight of gua gum or xanthane gum, and the mixture is reacted at a temperature of from 0° to 100° C in air or in the presence of an inert gas. As the polymerization initiator, a cerium ion type radical is preferably employed as in the above-mentioned case. Further, gua gum and xanthane gum is preferably of high purity as in the above case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer in the fine polishing composition for wafers according to the present invention, is usually at least 1 ppm, preferably from 10 to 1,000 ppm. When a wafer is polished with the polishing composition having a graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer content within this range, a laminar flow will be formed in the direction of polishing between the polishing cloth and the wafer surface, whereby the wafer surface can be made smoother. If the content is less than 1 ppm, such a laminar flow tends to be hardly formed. On the other hand, if the content exceeds 1,000 ppm, a turbulent flow is likely to be formed, such being undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fine polishing composition for wafers according to the present invention is adjusted with an alkaline substance to a pH of from 8 to 12, preferably from 9 to 10, to maintain the silica sol under a stabilized condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the alkaline substance, an alkali metal hydroxide, an amine or ammonia may be used. As the alkali metal hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide or cesium hydroxide may be mentioned. Among them, potassium hydroxide and, sodium hydroxide are preferred. The amine includes triethylamine, triethanolamine, monoethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, ethylenediamine, tetraethylpentamine, triethylpentamine, diethylenetriamine and hexamethylenediamine. Among them, ethylenediamine is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the second aspect of the present invention, the fine polishing composition for wafers further contains a water soluble salt in addition to the above described components. The water soluble salt has a function to reduce the thickness of the hydrated layer on the surface of silica particles in the fine polishing composition in the form of a slurry, whereby the dynamic action of the silica particles over the wafer during polishing operation of the wafer with the polishing composition, will increase, the mechanical polishing ability will increase, and the polishing efficiency will be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of the water-soluble salt include compounds composed of various combinations of a cation selected from the group consisting of lithium ion, sodium ion, potassium ion, cesium ion and ammonium ion and an anion selected from the group consisting of fluorine ion, chlorine ion, bromine ion, iodine ion, sulfuric acid ion, nitric acid ion, perchloric acid ion, carbonic acid ion, formic acid ion, acetic acid ion, acrylic acid ion and oxalic acid ion. Such compounds may be used alone or in combination as a mixure of two or more. Among them, potassium chloride and potassium perchlorate are preferred which have a high ionization degree in the polishing composition in the from of a slurry and the cation of which has a large atomic radius.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the water-soluble salt in the fine polishing composition for wafers according to the second aspect of the present invention, is usually at least 20 ppm. By the incorporation of the water-soluble salt, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the hydrated layer formed on the surface of silica particles. If the content is less than 20 ppm, no adequate effects can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention provides the following remarkable effects and its industrial value for practical application is very high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) When a wafer is polished with the fine polishing composition of the present invention, the above-mentioned graft-polymerized polysaccharide polymer in the slurry composition improves the drag reduction effect so that a laminar flow is formed between the polishing cloth and the wafer, while suppressing the formation of a turbulent flow. Accordingly, the polished wafer surface presents a smooth flat polished surface with no irregularities to be observed even when inspected with a differential interference microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) The fine polishing composition of the present invention has a good storage stability for a long period of time, since the polysaccharide polymer graft-polymerized with an acrylamide monomer alone or together with other specific vinyl monomer, has high resistance against biochemical decomposition due to microorganisms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) The fine polishing composition according to the second aspect of the present invention, provides not only the above-mentioned effects (1) and (2), but also a function to reduce the thickness of the hydrated layer on the surface of silica particles in the fine polishing composition in the form of a slurry, by virtue of the water-soluble salt, whereby the dynamic action of the silica particles on the wafer during the polishing operation of the wafer increases, and the mechanical polishing ability increases and the polishing efficiency is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by such specific Examples.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE A-1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Preparation of gua gum graft-polymerized with acrylamide</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Gua gum having a high molecular weight (Mayprodol 120, tradename, manufactured by Sansho K.K.) was dissolved in water to obtain a 0.5 wt % aqueous solution. This solution was purified by a filtration method and an alcohol extruction method in the following manner. Firstly, coarse impurities in the gua gum aqueous solution were removed by filtration by means of a mesh filter having a pore size of from 1 to 10 μm. Gua gum does not dissolve in an alcohol. Therefore, the gua gum aqueous solution was poured into an alcohol to elute alcohol-soluble impurities, and the precipitate was recovered. The precipitate was dried and dissolved again in water to obtain an aqueous gua gum solution having a predetermined concentration i.e. a 1 wt % gua gum aqueous solution in this Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To 1 liter of the 1 wt % aqueous solution thus obtained, 0.5 mol of acrylamide was added, and the mixture was stirred while bubbling nitrogen. To this mixture, 0.3 mmol of ammonium cerium nitrate was added as a polymerization initiator, and the mixture was reacted at room temperature for 24 hours under stirring to obtain gua gum graft-polymerized with acrylamide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The graft polymerization reaction may be conducted under an atmosphere of air by adding the polymerization initiator solution in an excess amount of about 10 mmol, or may be conducted by stirring the mixture for about one hour and leaving it to stand still thereafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Preparation of a polishing composition</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The 1 wt % aqueous solution of gua gum graft-polymerized with acrylamide obtained by the process of step (1) was added by an amount of 200 ppm as gua gum to an aqueous colloidal silica solution containing 2% by weight of silica having an average particle size of 70 mμm. To the aqueous solution thus obtained, dimethylamine was added in an amount of 0.6% by weight to adjust the pH to a level of from 9 to 10 to obtain a fine polishing composition for wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Storage test of the polishing composition</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polishing composition obtained in step (2) was stored. Periodically, this composition was permitted to flow under a pressure of 4 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> in a capillary tube having an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and a length of 50 cm, and the pressures at the inlet and the outlet of the capillary tube were measured to determine the period of time until the pressure loss increases to a level of 0.4 time beyond the pressure loss of water. The results are shown in Table 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Fine polishing test of a wafer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By a polishing machine SPAW 36, manufactured by Speed Fam, a silicon wafer was polished supplying the above-mentioned polishing composition at a rate of 1 l/min and using a soft sweade type polishing cloth. The polishing pressure was 100 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the relative speed of the polishing cloth to the wafer was 1 m/sec. The temperature of the polishing cloth during the polishing operation was 40° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The necessary polishing time for making smooth surface of wafer was measured. The determination for smoothness was evaluated by the observation of the wafer surface during the polishing operation by means of a differential interference microscope. The results are shown in Table 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the polishing by the polishing machine, rinse polishing was conducted while supplying water instead of the above polishing composition to remove silica and the polysaccharide polymer from the wafer surface. The time required for the rinse polishing was measured. The completion of the rinse polishing was determined by the observation of the wafer surface by means of a differential interference microscope. The results are shown in Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">This solution was purified in the same manner as in Example A-1(1), and the graft-polymerization of acrylamide was conducted also in the same manner to obtain xanthane gum graft-polymerization with acrylamide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Preparation of a polishing composition</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The 1 wt % aqueous solution of xanthane gum graft-polymerized with acrylamide obtained in step (1) was added by an amount of 200 ppm as xanthane gum to an aqueous colloidal silica solution containing 2% by weight of silica having an average particle size of 70 mμm. To the aqueous solution thus obtained, dimethylamine was added by an amount of 0.6% by weight to adjust the pH to a level of from 9 to 10 to obtain a fine polishing composition for wafers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The followings are evident from Table 2:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. The polishing compositions of the present invention do not lose the drag reduction effects even when stored for a long period of time and thus have excellent storage stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. When the polishing is conducted by using the polishing compositions of the present invention, the fine polishing time is short. Thus, the polishing compositions of the present invention are suitable as polishing agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">3. The silica content and the polymer content in the slurry required to accomplish the fine polishing can be small, such being economical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">4. Whereas, the polishing compositions of the Comparative Examples lose the drag reduction effects when stored even for a short period of time and thus have poor storage stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">5. When the polishing is conducted by using the polishing compositions of the Comparative Examples, the silica content and the polymer content in the slurry required to accomplish the fine polishing are obliged to be larger than the Examples of the present invention, such being economically disadvantageous.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">To the fine polishing composition for wafers prepared in the same manner as in Example A-1(2) and to the fine polishing composition for wafers prepared in the same manner as in Example B-1(2), a water-soluble salt was, respectively, added by the amount as shown in Table 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With respect to the fine polishing compositions for wafers thus obtained, the polishing tests of wafers were conducted in the same manner as in Example A-1(4) except that the relative speed of the polishing cloth to the wafer was changed to 1.2 m/sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, with respect to these fine polishing slurry compositions for wafers, the dispersion tests of the silica particles in the fine polishing compositions were conducted as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fine polishing slurry composition was put into a test tube having a height of 5 cm and a capacity of 100 cc and equipped with a stopper and left to stand still for one day. Then, the test tube was turned upside down and then to a normal position repeatedly until the silica particles were uniformly dispersed in the slurry as visually observed. The dispersibility was evaluated by the number of times of the operation until the uniform dispersion was obtained. The results are shown in Table 3.</div>
