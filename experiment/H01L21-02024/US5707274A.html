<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus for a semiconductor wafer, and in particular, to an improved chemical mechanical polishing apparatus for a semiconductor wafer which is capable of uniformly polishing the surface of the semiconductor wafer and of controlling the polishing amount by providing one or more rotary drums each wrapped in a polishing cloth and operable on the upper surface of a polishing pad, and connecting supporters capable of providing raising and lowering the rotary drums.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Conventional Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the trend towards higher integration of semiconductor devices, a semiconductor device is fabricated by stacking a plurality of layers on a limited region of a semiconductor substrate. To planarize the surface of the thusly fabricated highly integrated semiconductor device, a chemical mechanical polishing (hereinafter, called CMP) apparatus is used. That is, the CMP apparatus is used not only for the planarization of a semiconductor substrate, but also for a global planarization of a highly integrated pattern on the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, the conventional CMP apparatus according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,875 will now be explained in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A polishing pad 10 has a planar upper surface 11, at the edge of which vertical barrier wall 13 is provided. On the planar upper surface of the polishing pad is provided a polishing cloth 12 having a predetermined thickness and a plurality of holes 18 and is protected by the barrier wall 13. The polishing pad 10 is connected to a driving assembly 14, and reference numeral 5 denotes a slurry supplied on the polishing cloth 12 from a slurry entrance(not illustrated).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A carrier 1 holds a semiconductor wafer 2 to be polished face down on a lower surface thereof, and a backing pad 3 is inserted between the held semiconductor wafer 2 and the planar lower surface 4 of the carrier 1. The carrier 1 is placed on the polishing cloth 12 on the polishing pad 10. Reference numeral 17 designates a resilient cushion to surround the inside of barrier wall 13 and the resilient cushion 17 corresponds to resilient bumps 16 formed at both sides of the carrier 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of polishing, when the slurry 5 is supplied on the upper surface 12 of the polishing pad 10, the slurry 5 coats small holes 18 of the polishing cloth 12. The polishing pad 10 is rotated by the rotating force of the driving assembly 14, and the carrier 1 having the semiconductor wafer 2 attached to the lower surface thereof 1 conducts various motions on the polishing pad 10, such as a back and forth motion, an orbital motion or a random-direction motion. In accordance with the motions, the slurry 5 is coated on the semiconductor wafer 2 and the polishing cloth 12, and by abrasion, the surface of the semiconductor wafer 2 is polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">But, the conventional CMP apparatus has a problem in that the polishing amount of the semiconductor wafer 2 cannot be measured during the polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since the wafer is polished only by the rotation of the polishing pad with the carrier placed on the polishing cloth, the polishing amount of the semiconductor wafer 2 cannot be controlled. Besides, a plurality of wafers cannot be polished simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, another example of the conventional CMP apparatus, as disclosed in unexamined Japanese patent publication 7-66160 will now be explained in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A semiconductor wafer A is fixed on an absorbing platen 20 which is disposed in a recess 24a of the upper surface of a polishing pad 24.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The cylindrical surface of a rotary drum 26 is contacted on the semiconductor wafer A, and radially penetrating holes 40 are formed in the cylindrical surface of the rotary drum 26, and a polishing cloth 38 is wrapped around the cylindrical surface. As the rotary drum 26 is contacted on the upper surface of the wafer A, the rotary drum 26 can be moved back and forth by a supporter 28 attached to both ends of the rotary drum 26.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of polishing, a slurry is supplied to the rotary drum 26 through a slurry supplying hose 36, and then is coated on the polishing cloth 38 through the penetrating holes 40. Then, as friction between the polishing cloth 38 and the surface of the semiconductor wafer A is produced, and the polishing operation proceeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">But, the CMP apparatus is capable of measuring only a part of the polishing amount, and since the semiconductor wafer only rotates, during the polishing a difference in the polishing amount can result caused between the central portion and peripheral edge of the wafer, and the polishing is performed non-uniformly due to the difference in the force which is produced when the rotary drum makes a back-and-forth movement. In addition, because each semiconductor wafer is polished one by one, the productivity is low and mass production is impossible to achieve.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer which is capable of measuring and controlling the polishing amount of the semiconductor wafer in the course of polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer which is capable of polishing the surface of the semiconductor wafer uniformly and of polishing a plurality of wafers simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To achieve the above object, there is provided a CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer according to an embodiment of the present invention which includes a rotatable polishing pad in a planar upper surface of which a plurality of recesses are formed for each holding therein a semiconductor wafer, a plurality of rotary drum polishing unit disposable on the polishing pad for planarizing the surface of the semiconductor wafers, a supporter connected to the ends of each rotary drum for lifting and lowering the rotary drum, and a slurry applicator located above each rotary drum for applying a slurry thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the upper portion of the polishing pad can be formed to have a graded surface rising toward the central portion. In the course of the polishing, debris generated from the semiconductor wafers run down the graded surface of the polishing pad, and accordingly the debris is easily removed, resulting in obtaining a clean semiconductor wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 2A and 2B are views showing a conventional CMP apparatus;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 3A and 3B are a plan view and a cross-sectional view taken along line a-a', respectively, of a CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer according to a first embodiment of the present invention; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer according to another embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, in the upper surface of the polishing pad 102 are formed a plurality of circular recesses 102a for each receiving therein a semiconductor wafer 2, and on a central portion of a lower surface thereof is vertically integrally formed a driving shaft 108 having a hollow central part and communicating with a central hole 102b formed in the polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Above the surface of the polishing pad 102, a plurality of polishing units 110(in the drawing, three are provided) are disposed which each include a rotary drums 101. The rotary drums 101 are wrapped by polishing cloths 103a,103b and 103c. The rotary drums 101 each have a respective rotating axis 104, and one end of each rotating axis 104 is rotatably connected to a support 106 in which a ball bearing 106a is equipped and the other end thereof is also rotatably connected to a supporter 106' having a ball bearing therein and provided in the central part of the polishing platen 102. The lateral length of the rotary drum 101 is sufficient to cover sufficient the diameter of the semiconductor wafer 2. At one side of the rotating axis 104 of each rotary drums is connected a driving motor 104a which can rotate the rotating axis 104 in accordance with an externally supplied electrical power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Above each rotary drum 101 is located a slurry applicator 105a which has a slurry applicator exit 107a as long as the diameter of the semiconductor wafer 2 disposed in the recesses 102a on the polishing pad 102. The slurry applicator 105a supplies a shower of slurry 107 to the rotary drum 101 through the slurry applicator exit 107a. Another two slurry applicators 105a,105b perform the same function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end of the rotary drum 101 can be separated from the supporters 106,106' by separating the rotating axes 104 connected to the supporters 106,106'.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of polishing, as the slurry 107 is supplied to the rotary drum 101 of each polishing unit 110 through the slurry applicator exit 107a, and coats the polishing cloths 103a,103b,103c, the polishing pad 102 having the plurality of the semiconductor wafer 2 disposed in its recesses 102a is rotated by the rotating force of the driving shaft 108, and accordingly the semiconductor wafers 2 start revolving. Then, the surfaces of the semiconductor wafers 2 are contacted by the polishing cloths 103a,103b,103c wrapping the rotary drums on which the slurry 107 is coated and are polished thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the polishing amount of the wafer surface can be controlled while each rotary drum 101 can increase or decrease the pressure applied to the surface of the semiconductor wafer 2 by making a vertical movement of the supporters 106,106'.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the semiconductor wafer 2 is revolved and polished on the polishing pad 102, the surface of the semiconductor wafer 2 contacted with the surface of the rotary drum 101 can be polished uniformly and impartially. And, the polishing is carried out in a condition that the slurry is spread uniformly on the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer 2, and the polished material is easily removed from the polishing pad 102 to the exterior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-described polishing course, another polishing process can be performed by using other polishing cloths 103a,103b,103c on each rotary drum and supplying another kind of slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing a CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer according to another embodiment of the present invention. The upper surface portion of the polishing pad 109 is formed to have a graded surface 109a slanted upward towards the central part of the polishing pad 109.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of polishing, the debris material generated by the semiconductor wafer 2 runs down along the graded surface 109a of the polishing pad 109, and is easily removed, resulting in achieving a cleaner semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The rotary drum 101 has a conical-shape having both ends of different diameters, but can be manufactured as a cylindrical roller-shape having a uniform diameter. The rotary drum 101 can be separated from the supporters 106,106' by separating the rotating axis 104 connected to the supporters 106,106'.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, the CMP apparatus for a semiconductor wafer according to the present invention has the effect that the polishing amount of the semiconductor wafer can be measured and controlled in the course of polishing, and the surface of the semiconductor wafer can be uniformly polished since the surface of the semiconductor wafer is contacted with the surface of the rotary drum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since a required amount of the slurry is supplied through the slurry applicator as a shower, the spending of the slurry can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, because a plurality of semiconductor wafers can be polished simultaneously, the productivity can be enhanced to a great extent, and the polishing amount of the semiconductor wafers can be measured and controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as recited in the accompanying claims.</div>
