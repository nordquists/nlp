<div class="abstract">A system is provided for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of a semiconductor wafer by periodically relatively moving a polishing pad on a rotating platen, and the wafer, retained in the aperture of a rotating and oscillating ring having a wear surface surrounding the aperture and wafer, with respect to each other while the wafer and wear surface frictionally contact the pad. A CMP slurry is dispensed to the wafer periphery in the vicinity of the pad at a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart channels in the wear surface maintained in fixed relation to the wafer during the relative movement. The ring is fixed to the underside of a carrier in turn fixed at its upper portion to the bottom end of a spindle which is rotatably mounted at its top end on an oscillating support beam, such that the wafer, ring, carrier and spindle rotate and oscillate in common. The carrier has a heat exchanger to heat or cool the slurry. Passages in the spindle flow connected with conduits in the carrier correspondingly supply the slurry to the ring channels, temperature adjusting fluid to and from the heat exchanger, and pressure fluid, e.g., air, to the inner side of the wafer in the ring aperture, respectively, during common rotation and oscillation of the wafer, ring, carrier and spindle.</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES54606893">
<div class="description-paragraph">This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/315,090 filed May 19,1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,224.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to a system, including a method and an apparatus, for dispensing polishing liquid during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of a semiconductor wafer, e.g., of silicon, and more particularly, to such a system for feeding a polishing liquid to the wafer surface periphery in the vicinity of a polishing surface during relative periodic movement between such surfaces, especially while also adjusting the temperature of the polishing liquid in the vicinity of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As used herein, “semiconductor wafer” means any microelectronic device, substrate, chip or the like, e.g., of silicon, used to provide an integrated circuit or other related circuitry structure subject to chemical mechanical polishing procedures such as for achieving planarization over an entire surface of the wafer.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In fabricating microelectronic semiconductor devices and the like on a wafer substrate or chip, e.g., of silicon, to form an integrated circuit (IC), etc., various metal layers and insulation layers are deposited in selective sequence. To maximize integration of device components in the available substrate area to fit more components in the same area, increased IC miniaturization is utilized. Reduced pitch dimensions are needed for denser packing of components per present day very large scale integration (VLSI), e.g., at sub-micron (below 1 micron, i.e., 1,000 nanometer or 10,000 angstrom) dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One type of wet chemical process used in the IC fabrication of a semiconductor wafer concerns the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of a surface of the wafer against a polishing pad during relative periodic movement therebetween, such as with a caustic slurry containing finely divided abrasive particles, e.g., colloidal silica in an aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, as the polishing liquid. This removes, i.e., by chemical etching and mechanical abrasion, a thin layer of material, e.g., of 1 micron or less thickness, so as to planarize a top surface of the wafer. Close control of the slurry flow rate, temperature and pH are necessary to attain in a reproducible manner a uniform removal rate per the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conventional CMP process involves introducing the slurry from a stationary overlying tube dropwise onto a polishing pad of a rotating table (platen) which rotates about a stationary platen axis and against which the wafer, which is carried by a retaining ring, makes frictional contact while the wafer and ring rotate and oscillate relative to the platen. The wafer is positioned in a medial aperture of the ring such that the ring also makes frictional contact with the polishing pad. As the position of the wafer relative to the platen varies during wafer rotation and oscillation, the slurry dispensing tube is always spaced a minimum clearance distance from the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Consequently, different portions of the wafer necessarily encounter dispensed slurry droplets having different thermal histories. This depends on the continuously varying distance between the relative position of rotation and oscillation of the wafer, and in particular of its leading and trailing edges during oscillation, and the position of the centrifugally outwardly travelling slurry droplets dispensed onto the rotating platen from the stationary tube. As a result, the operating temperature at the local polishing site of the wafer is non-uniform, leading to non-uniformity of the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, some of the slurry on the polishing pad is pushed off the platen by the retaining ring which surrounds the wafer, inasmuch as the ring is also in frictional contact with the pad and in some cases is pressed under positive mechanical pressure thereagainst. This loss of slurry constitutes wastage which increases operating costs. By its inherent wafer-captively surrounding arrangement, the retaining ring also impedes flow of slurry to the central area of the wafer surface being polished. This causes poor center-to-edge uniformity, further detracting from the uniformity of the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Where the process requires heating of the slurry, such as in the case of polysilicon CMP, then a separate heating module, which occupies expensive floor space (module footprint), must be provided to supply heated slurry to the tube for dispensing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above prior art drawbacks cause adverse variation in the local removal rate of wafer material from different parts of the wafer due to variation in the amount and temperature of the slurry coming into contact with the wafer surface being polished. This diminishes the degree of within-wafer uniformity. Also, slurry wastage increases its consumption rate and cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable to have a system, including a method and an apparatus, permitting CMP operations to be performed on a semiconductor wafer under reproducible uniform conditions of polishing liquid temperature, polishing liquid dispensing flow rate, and supplying of polishing liquid locally to all portions of the wafer regardless of its relative position of movement with respect to the platen polishing pad, and optionally also under reproducible uniform conditions of selective temperature adjustment of the polishing liquid in the vicinity of the wafer.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The foregoing drawbacks are obviated in accordance with the present invention by providing a system, including a method and an apparatus, which permits chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) operations to be performed on a semiconductor wafer, e.g., of silicon, under reproducible uniform conditions of polishing liquid temperature, polishing liquid dispensing flow rate, and supplying of polishing liquid locally to all portions of the wafer regardless of its relative position of movement with respect to the platen polishing pad, and optionally also under reproducible uniform conditions of selective temperature adjustment of the polishing liquid in the vicinity of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The system of the invention minimizes variation in the local removal rate of material from different parts of the wafer being polished since the CMP operation is carried out so as to limit variation in the amount and temperature of the polishing liquid coming into contact with the wafer surface being polished. This improves, i.e., increases, the degree of within-wafer uniformity attainable. Polishing liquid wastage is avoided, so that its consumption rate and cost are reduced to a minimum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the need for a stand-alone polishing liquid heating module is eliminated, thereby conserving floor space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to a first aspect of the invention, a method is provided for CMP of a surface of a semiconductor wafer having a surface periphery. The method comprises periodically relatively moving a substantially flat polishing surface and the wafer with respect to each other while maintaining the wafer surface in frictional contact with the polishing surface, and dispensing a chemical mechanical polishing liquid to the wafer surface periphery in the vicinity of the polishing surface. The dispensing is effected at a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart points maintained in fixed relation to the wafer surface periphery during the relative periodic movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polishing liquid may be, e.g., a caustic aqueous slurry containing finely divided abrasive particles, such as an aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) slurry containing colloidal silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Typically, the polishing liquid is dispensed at a temperature of about 15-50° C. and the wafer surface is maintained in frictional contact with the polishing surface under a mechanical pressure of about 2-8 pounds per square inch (psi) periodic movement. More specifically, the adjusting comprises heating the polishing liquid to a selective elevated temperature, such as about 25-50° C., in the vicinity of the wafer surface and in fixed relation thereto during the relative periodic movement, especially while maintaining the wafer surface in frictional contact with the polishing surface under a mechanical pressure of about 2-8 psi.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In particular, the polishing surface is in the form of a rotating platen which is rotated at a first selective rotational speed, such as about 25-100 revolutions per minute (rpm), about a platen axis. Concordantly, the wafer is rotated at a second selective rotational speed, such as about 25-100 rpm, and especially within about 5 rpm above or below the rotational speed of the platen, about a wafer axis spaced from and substantially parallel to the platen axis. The wafer is also oscillated relative to the platen axis at a selective frequency and amplitude, such as at a frequency of about 3-8 cycles per minute (cpm) and an amplitude of about 10-30 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to another preferred feature, the wafer is perimetrically retained in a retaining ring. The ring has a wear surface surrounding the wafer surface and in substantially flush coplanar relation with the wafer surface for common rotation and oscillation therewith. The polishing liquid is dispensed to the wafer surface periphery from a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart fixed points on the ring.</div>

At the same time, a chemical mechanical polishing liquid is dispensed to the wafer surface periphery in the vicinity of the polishing surface at a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart points maintained in fixed relation to the wafer surface periphery during the relative periodic movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer surface is typically oscillated radially relative to the platen axis to move the wafer axis toward and away from the platen axis.</div>

Thus, the polishing liquid may be dispensed to the wafer surface periphery from a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart fixed points on the ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The method preferably further comprises selectively adjusting the temperature of the polishing liquid in the vicinity of the wafer surface and in fixed relation thereto during the relative periodic movement, the adjusting being effected adjacent the retaining ring. The adjusting may comprise heating the polishing liquid to a selective elevated temperature, such as about 25-50° C., in the vicinity of the wafer surface and in fixed relation thereto during the relative periodic movement. The heating is effected adjacent the retaining ring, especially while maintaining the wafer surface in frictional contact with the polishing surface under a mechanical pressure of about 2-8 psi.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown an apparatus <b>10</b> for chemical mechanical polishing of a surface WS of a semiconductor wafer W having a surface periphery WP in accordance with the prior art. The apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a platen <b>11</b>, a polishing pad <b>12</b>, a shaft <b>13</b>, a gear unit <b>14</b>, a base <b>15</b>, a motor <b>16</b>, a platen axis <b>17</b> and a tube <b>18</b> for dispensing a chemical mechanical polishing liquid (slurry) S, and a polishing unit <b>21</b> having a support beam <b>22</b>, an oscillation arrow <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, a bearing unit <b>23</b>, a gear unit <b>24</b>, a motor <b>25</b>, a spindle <b>26</b>, a spindle axis <b>27</b>, a carrier <b>28</b> and a ring <b>29</b> for retaining a semiconductor wafer W having a surface WS to be polished and a surface periphery WP. The spindle <b>26</b> has a top end <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and a bottom end <b>26</b> <i>b</i>, the carrier <b>28</b> has an upper portion <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, a lower portion <b>28</b> <i>b </i>and an underside portion <b>28</b> <i>c</i>, and the ring <b>29</b> has an aperture <b>29</b> <i>a </i>and a wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Platen <b>11</b> is typically formed as a circular disc, e.g., of aluminum, covered by polishing pad <b>12</b>, e.g., of polyurethane fibrous plastic sheeting material, and is carried on shaft <b>13</b> which is mounted via gear unit <b>14</b> on base <b>15</b> for rotation by motor <b>16</b> about a stationary platen axis <b>17</b> in conventional manner. Tube <b>18</b> is stationarily located in overlying relation to platen <b>11</b> to dispense slurry S onto polishing pad <b>12</b> at a given flow rate. Polishing unit <b>21</b> is located generally diametrically opposite tube <b>18</b> with respect to platen axis <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polishing unit <b>21</b> includes support beam <b>22</b> which is mounted on a base (not shown) for back and forth oscillation, e.g., in a radial direction relative to platen axis <b>17</b>, as indicated by oscillation arrow <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. Support beam <b>22</b> carries bearing unit <b>23</b>, gear unit <b>24</b> and motor <b>25</b> for common oscillation therewith. Spindle <b>26</b> is mounted at its top end <b>26</b> <i>a </i>in bearing unit <b>23</b> and gear unit <b>24</b> for rotation by motor <b>25</b> about spindle axis (wafer axis) <b>27</b> and for common oscillation with support beam <b>22</b>, in conventional manner. Carrier <b>28</b> is mounted at its upper portion <b>28</b> <i>a </i>on bottom end <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of spindle <b>26</b> for common rotation and oscillation therewith. Lower portion <b>28</b> <i>b </i>of carrier <b>28</b> defines underside portion <b>28</b> <i>c </i>which carries ring <b>29</b> for common rotation and oscillation therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ring <b>29</b> has a generally medial aperture <b>29</b> <i>a </i>and a peripheral wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b </i>perimetrically surrounding aperture <b>29</b> <i>a</i>. Aperture <b>29</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to retain therein for common movement with ring <b>29</b> in conventional manner a semiconductor wafer W, e.g., of silicon, having a surface WS to be chemically mechanically polished and a surface periphery WP. Wafer W is maintained in aperture <b>29</b> <i>a </i>and against the underside portion <b>28</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>28</b> such that wafer surface WS is in substantially flush coplanar relation with wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b </i>and is peripherally surrounded at surface periphery WP by wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Support beam <b>22</b> is arranged such that wafer W and wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b </i>of ring <b>29</b> are maintained in common frictional contact with polishing pad <b>12</b> as they are commonly rotated, e.g., counter-clockwise, and commonly oscillated, e.g., in the direction of arrow <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, and as platen <b>11</b> is rotated in like manner, e.g., also counter-clockwise, in conventional manner, while slurry S is dispensed from tube <b>18</b> onto pad <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is clear from FIGS. 1 and 2 that the conventional CMP process has the problem of different parts of wafer W encountering droplets of slurry S with different thermal histories, depending on the constantly varying distance between the rotating and oscillating wafer W, and in particular its leading and trailing oscillating edges at surface periphery WP, and the centrifugally outwardly travelling droplets of slurry S dispensed onto the rotating platen <b>11</b> from the stationary tube <b>18</b>. Hence, the slurry temperature at the local polishing site of wafer W is non-uniform and so also is the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Inherently, some slurry S on pad <b>12</b> is pushed off platen <b>11</b> by ring <b>29</b> which surrounds wafer W, since its wear surface <b>29</b> <i>b </i>frictionally contacts polishing pad <b>12</b>, typically under positive mechanical pressure. This loss of slurry S increases operating costs. By its wafer-captively surrounding nature, ring <b>29</b> also impedes flow of slurry S to the central area of wafer surface WS, causing poor center-to-edge uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, if heating of slurry S is required, as in the case of polysilicon CMP, a separate heating module is needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These drawbacks of conventional CMP cause adverse variation in the local removal rate of material from different parts of wafer W due to variation in the amount and temperature of slurry S contacting wafer surface WS, thus diminishing the degree of within-wafer uniformity, while the wastage of slurry S increases operating costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These drawbacks are avoided in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIGS. 3 to <b>7</b>, there is shown an apparatus <b>40</b> for chemical mechanical polishing of a surface WS of a semiconductor wafer W having a surface periphery WP in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus <b>40</b> comprises a platen <b>41</b>, a polishing pad <b>42</b>, a shaft <b>43</b>, a gear unit <b>44</b>, a base <b>45</b>, a motor <b>46</b>, and a platen axis <b>47</b>, and a polishing unit <b>51</b> having a support beam <b>52</b>, an oscillation arrow <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, a bearing unit <b>53</b>, a gear unit <b>54</b>, a motor <b>55</b>, a spindle <b>56</b>, a spindle axis <b>57</b>, a carrier <b>58</b> and a ring <b>59</b> for retaining a semiconductor wafer W having a surface WS to be polished and a surface periphery WP. The spindle <b>56</b> has a top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>and a bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b</i>, the carrier <b>58</b> has an upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a</i>, a lower portion <b>58</b> <i>b </i>and an underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c</i>, the ring <b>59</b> has an aperture <b>59</b> <i>a</i>, a wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>and channels <b>61</b> for dispensing a chemical mechanical polishing liquid (slurry) S, the carrier <b>58</b> also has a slurry conduit <b>62</b> and slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>and the bearing unit <b>53</b> has a cap <b>63</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Platen <b>41</b> is typically formed as a circular disc, e.g., of aluminum, covered by polishing pad <b>42</b>, e.g., of polyurethane fibrous plastic sheeting material, and is carried on shaft <b>43</b> which is mounted via gear unit <b>44</b> on base <b>45</b> for rotation by motor <b>46</b> about a stationary platen axis <b>47</b> in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polishing unit <b>51</b> includes support beam <b>52</b> which is mounted on a base (not shown) for back and forth oscillation, e.g., in a radial direction relative to platen axis <b>47</b>, as indicated by oscillation arrow <b>52</b> <i>a</i>. Support beam <b>52</b> carries bearing unit <b>53</b>, gear unit <b>54</b> and motor <b>55</b> for common oscillation therewith. Spindle <b>56</b> is mounted at its top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>in bearing unit <b>53</b> and gear unit <b>54</b> for rotation by motor <b>55</b> about spindle axis (wafer axis) <b>57</b> and for common oscillation with support beam <b>52</b>, in conventional manner. Carrier <b>58</b> is mounted at its upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a </i>on bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b </i>of spindle <b>56</b> for common rotation and oscillation therewith. Lower portion <b>58</b> <i>b </i>of carrier <b>58</b> defines underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>which carries ring <b>59</b> for common rotation and oscillation therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ring <b>59</b> has a generally medial aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>and a peripheral wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>perimetrically surrounding aperture <b>59</b> <i>a</i>. Aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to retain therein for common movement with ring <b>59</b> in conventional manner a semiconductor wafer W, e.g., of silicon, having a surface WS to be chemically mechanically polished and a surface periphery WP. Wafer W is maintained in aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>and against the underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> such that wafer surface WS is in substantially flush coplanar relation with wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>and is peripherally surrounded at surface periphery WP by wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Support beam <b>52</b> is arranged such that wafer W and wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>of ring <b>59</b> are maintained in common frictional contact with polishing pad <b>42</b> as they are commonly rotated, e.g., counter-clockwise, and commonly oscillated, e.g., in the direction of arrow <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, and as platen <b>41</b> is rotated in like manner, e.g., also counter-clockwise, in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At the same time, i.e., during the relative periodic movement of ring <b>59</b> with respect to platen <b>41</b>, slurry S is dispensed at a given flow rate in respective flows from a plurality of, e.g., four, perimetrically spaced apart channels <b>61</b> defined in wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>to wafer surface WS at corresponding adjacent portions of surface periphery WP in the vicinity of polishing pad <b>42</b>. Thus, slurry S is dispensed at a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart points, i.e., at channels <b>61</b> in facing relation to wafer surface periphery WP, maintained in fixed relation to wafer surface WS in any position of movement of wafer W and ring <b>59</b> during the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For this purpose, carrier <b>58</b> is provided with a slurry conduit <b>62</b> extending, e.g., centrally axially along spindle axis <b>57</b>, from its upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a </i>to its lower portion <b>58</b> <i>b </i>and which downwardly terminates in a plurality of, e.g., four, slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a</i>. The plurality of slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>generally radially outwardly extend from slurry conduit <b>62</b> to underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>for corresponding flow communication with the like plurality of channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b> at wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now more specifically to FIG. 5, it is seen that apparatus <b>40</b> additionally includes slurry conduit coils <b>62</b> <i>b</i>, a slurry passage <b>64</b>, a heat exchanger <b>65</b>, a chamber <b>66</b>, an inflow conduit <b>67</b>, an outflow conduit <b>68</b>, an inflow passage <b>69</b>, an outflow passage <b>70</b>, an air conduit <b>71</b>, an air passage <b>72</b>, a slurry bore <b>73</b>, an inflow bore <b>74</b>, an outflow bore <b>75</b>, an air bore <b>76</b>, and the grooves <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> and <b>83</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Spindle <b>56</b> is provided with slurry passage <b>64</b> which extends, e.g., centrally axially along spindle axis <b>57</b>, like slurry conduit <b>62</b> of carrier <b>58</b>, from its top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>to its bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b </i>and is arranged for alignment and flow communication with slurry conduit <b>62</b> of carrier <b>58</b>. Cap <b>63</b> of bearing unit <b>53</b> is desirably axially adjustably attached, e.g., by screw threads, to the top portion of bearing unit <b>53</b> to make constant sliding seal contact with the top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>of rotating spindle <b>56</b> in conventional manner. Cap <b>63</b> is provided with slurry bore <b>73</b> which is positioned, e.g., centrally axially, and arranged for alignment and flow communication with slurry passage <b>64</b> of spindle <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, although spindle <b>56</b> rotates with respect to non-rotating cap <b>63</b>, slurry S may be fed from a non-rotatable supply (not shown) at a predetermined flow rate through slurry bore <b>73</b> of cap <b>63</b>, slurry passage <b>64</b> of spindle <b>56</b>, slurry conduit <b>62</b> and slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>of carrier <b>58</b> to slurry channels <b>61</b> of ring <b>59</b>, in any position of rotational movement of spindle <b>56</b> relative to bearing unit <b>53</b>, and cap <b>63</b>, for uniform dispensing to the immediately adjacent portions of wafer surface WS at wafer surface periphery WP for efficient CMP of wafer surface WS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Desirably, carrier <b>58</b> also includes heat exchanger <b>65</b>, e.g., formed as a chamber <b>66</b>, with inflow conduit <b>67</b> extending from its upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a </i>to chamber <b>66</b>, outflow conduit <b>68</b> extending from chamber <b>66</b> to its upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and slurry conduit <b>62</b> passing through chamber <b>66</b>, e.g., in the form of one or more slurry conduit coils <b>62</b> <i>b </i>of heat transfer material such as metal tubing, in indirect heat exchange relation to chamber <b>66</b> and inflow conduit <b>67</b> and outflow conduit <b>68</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In turn, spindle <b>56</b> has inflow passage <b>69</b> and outflow passage <b>70</b>, each extending from its top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>to its bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b </i>and arranged for corresponding flow communication with inflow conduit <b>67</b> and outflow conduit <b>68</b>, respectively, of carrier <b>58</b>. Cap <b>63</b> of bearing unit <b>53</b> has inflow bore <b>74</b> and outflow bore <b>75</b> arranged for corresponding flow communication with inflow passage <b>69</b> and outflow passage <b>70</b>, respectively, of spindle <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, although spindle <b>56</b> rotates with respect to non-rotating cap <b>63</b>, temperature adjusting fluid, e.g., heated or cooled liquid, is fed as inflow I from a non-rotating circulating supply (not shown), e.g., at a predetermined flow rate and temperature, through inflow bore <b>74</b> of cap <b>63</b>, inflow passage <b>69</b> of spindle <b>56</b> and inflow conduit <b>67</b> of carrier <b>58</b> to chamber <b>66</b> for indirect heat exchange with slurry S in slurry conduit <b>62</b>, e.g., via heat transfer slurry conduit coils <b>62</b> <i>a</i>. The temperature adjusting fluid is then returned from chamber <b>66</b> as outflow O via outlet conduit <b>68</b> of carrier <b>58</b>, outflow passage <b>70</b> of spindle <b>56</b> and outflow bore <b>75</b> of cap <b>63</b> to the non-rotating circulating supply (not shown) for reheating or recooling, as the case may be, before being fed again to inflow bore <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This circulating flow of temperature adjusting fluid is thus fed as inflow I via inflow bore <b>74</b> to chamber <b>66</b> of heat exchanger <b>65</b> and returned as outflow O via outflow bore <b>75</b> therefrom in any position of rotational movement of spindle <b>56</b> relative to bearing unit <b>53</b>, and cap <b>63</b>, for uniform heat exchange temperature adjustment of slurry S just before it is dispensed via channels <b>61</b> of ring <b>59</b> for efficient CMP of wafer surface WS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conveniently, the circulating inflow I and outflow O of the temperature adjusting fluid is preheated or precooled external to carrier <b>58</b> yet within the confines of apparatus <b>40</b>, such as in the vicinity of support beam <b>52</b> by suitable means such as a heating or cooling element (not shown) in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polishing unit <b>51</b> also desirably has an air conduit <b>71</b> extending from upper portion <b>58</b> <i>a </i>to lower portion <b>58</b> <i>b </i>of carrier <b>58</b> and flow communicating with underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> within the confines of aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>of ring <b>59</b>. Spindle <b>56</b> has air passage <b>72</b> extending from its top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>to its bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b </i>and arranged in flow communication with air conduit <b>71</b> of carrier <b>58</b>. Cap <b>63</b> of bearing unit <b>53</b> has air bore <b>76</b> arranged in flow communication with air passage <b>72</b> of spindle <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While spindle <b>56</b> rotates with respect to non-rotating cap <b>63</b>, air, e.g., compressed air, or other pressure fluid A, is fed from a supply (not shown), e.g., at a predetermined pressure, through air bore <b>76</b> of cap <b>63</b>, air passage <b>72</b> of spindle <b>56</b> and air conduit <b>71</b> of carrier <b>58</b> to underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> for acting against the adjacent portion of wafer W retained in aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>of ring <b>59</b> at underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> to maintain wafer W in substantially flush coplanar relation with wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>of ring <b>59</b> in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This flow of air or other pressure fluid A is thus fed via air bore <b>76</b> to underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> in any position of rotational movement of spindle <b>56</b> relative to bearing unit <b>53</b>, and cap <b>63</b>, for uniform maintenance of wafer surface WS in substantially flush coplanar relation with wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>of ring <b>59</b> for efficient CMP of wafer surface WS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since spindle <b>56</b> rotates while cap <b>63</b> is non-rotatable, the top surface of spindle <b>56</b> is suitably provided with three concentric circular grooves about axial slurry passage <b>64</b>. These include inner inflow groove <b>77</b> in radial alignment with inflow passage <b>69</b>, middle outflow groove <b>78</b> in radial alignment with outflow passage <b>70</b> and outer air groove <b>79</b> in radial alignment with air passage <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now more specifically to FIG. 6, it is seen that inflow groove <b>77</b>, outflow groove <b>78</b> and air groove <b>79</b> at the top end <b>56</b> <i>a </i>of spindle <b>56</b> are concentric to central slurry passage <b>64</b> and are so aligned with regard to inflow passage <b>69</b>, outflow passage <b>70</b> and air passage <b>72</b>, respectively, that inflow bore <b>74</b>, outflow bore <b>75</b> and air bore <b>76</b> in cap <b>63</b> are correspondingly in constant flow communication via grooves <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> and <b>79</b>, respectively, with inflow passage <b>69</b>, outflow passage <b>70</b> and air passage <b>72</b>, respectively, in any position of rotational movement of spindle <b>56</b> relative to cap <b>63</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring again to FIG. 5, it is seen that the bottom surface of spindle <b>56</b> has a similar set of three concentric circular grooves about axial slurry passage <b>64</b>. These include inner inflow groove <b>80</b> in radial alignment with inflow passage <b>69</b>, middle outflow groove <b>81</b> in radial alignment with outflow passage <b>70</b> and outer air groove <b>82</b> in radial alignment with air passage <b>72</b>. Inflow groove <b>80</b>, outflow groove <b>81</b> and air groove <b>82</b> in the bottom end <b>56</b> <i>b </i>of spindle <b>56</b> are concentric to central slurry passage <b>64</b> and are so aligned with regard to inflow passage <b>69</b>, outflow passage <b>70</b> and air passage <b>72</b>, respectively, that inflow conduit <b>69</b>, outflow conduit <b>68</b> and air conduit <b>71</b> in carrier <b>58</b> are correspondingly in constant flow communication via grooves <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>, respectively, with inflow passage <b>69</b>, outflow passage <b>70</b> and air passage <b>72</b>, respectively, in any angular rotational position of spindle <b>56</b> relative to carrier <b>58</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> has a similar concentric circular slurry groove <b>83</b> defined therein in alignment with axial slurry passage <b>64</b> in spindle <b>56</b> and the upper portion of slurry conduit <b>62</b> adjacent thereto in carrier <b>58</b>. Slurry groove <b>83</b> is in common alignment with each of the plurality of slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>extending from slurry conduit <b>62</b> to underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b>. Thus, sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>of carrier <b>58</b> are correspondingly in constant flow communication via groove <b>83</b> with channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b> in any angular rotational position of ring <b>59</b> relative to carrier <b>58</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In as much as slurry bore <b>73</b> in cap <b>63</b>, slurry passage <b>64</b> in spindle <b>56</b> and slurry conduit <b>62</b> in carrier <b>58</b> are in coaxial alignment, they are inherently in constant flow communication with each other in any angular rotational position of spindle <b>56</b> and carrier <b>58</b> relative to cap <b>63</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Carrier <b>58</b> may be connected to spindle <b>56</b> for common movement therewith by any suitable connecting means such as screws or the like. However, if spindle <b>56</b> and carrier <b>58</b> are provided as an integral unit (not shown), grooves <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> in the bottom surface of spindle <b>56</b> may be omitted since in this case inflow passage <b>69</b> and inflow conduit <b>67</b> will be integral with each other, outflow passage <b>70</b> and outflow conduit <b>68</b> will be integral with each other and air passage <b>72</b> and air conduit <b>71</b> will be integral with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, if spindle <b>56</b> is provided as a hollow tube (not shown), passages <b>64</b>, <b>69</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> may take the form of, e.g., plastic, tubing extending through the hollow tube spindle and mounted in upper and lower end caps on the hollow tube (not shown), in similar manner to cap <b>63</b> relative to bearing unit <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ring <b>59</b> may also be mounted on carrier <b>58</b> for common movement therewith by any suitable connecting means such as screws or the like. However, if ring <b>59</b> is mounted on carrier <b>58</b> such that the plurality of wear surface channels <b>61</b> are in corresponding individual angular rotational alignment and flow communication with the equal plurality of slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>of carrier <b>58</b>, respectively then groove <b>83</b> in underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now more specifically to FIG. 7, it is seen that during relative periodic movement of ring <b>59</b> with respect to platen <b>41</b>, slurry S is dispensed at a predetermined flow rate uniformly in respective flows from the perimetrically spaced apart channels <b>61</b> in wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>which radially inwardly face wafer surface periphery WP. Hence, slurry S is immediately dispensed to wafer surface WS at corresponding adjacent portions of surface periphery WP. Slurry S is thereby uniformly dispensed at a plurality of perimetrically spaced apart points at channels <b>61</b> which are in facing relation to surface periphery WP and in fixed relation to wafer surface WS in any position of movement of wafer W and ring <b>59</b> during the CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Slurry S readily reaches channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b> via slurry sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>which extend radially outwardly from axially located slurry conduit <b>62</b> to groove <b>83</b> in carrier <b>58</b>, as shown in dashed line in FIG. <b>7</b>. Groove <b>83</b> in carrier <b>58</b> is in constant flow connection with channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Slurry S is typically dispensed via wear surface channels <b>61</b> at a flow rate of about 100-200 mL/min. Platen <b>41</b> is rotated at about 25-100 rpm and ring <b>59</b> and wafer W are commonly rotated at about 25-100 rpm and within a differential of about 5 rpm of the speed of rotation of platen <b>41</b>. At the same time, ring <b>59</b> and wafer W are also oscillated at a frequency of about 3-8 cpm, e.g., about 5 cpm, and at an amplitude of about 10-30 mm, e.g., about 20 mm. The polishing time of the CMP operation is generally about 1-5 minutes in duration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Wafer W is typically of circular disc shape with a diameter of about 8 inches (200 mm), and formed of silicon. Ring <b>59</b> has a conforming circular aperture <b>59</b> <i>a </i>also about 8 inches in diameter, and such that a gap of at most about 1 mm exists between the wafer periphery and the confining inner wall portion of ring <b>59</b> defining aperture <b>59</b> <i>a</i>. The annular portion of ring <b>59</b> defining wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>is typically about 2 inches in radial extent, whereby the outer diameter of ring <b>59</b> is about 10 inches and its outer circumference is about 31.4 inches. Platen <b>41</b> typically has a diameter of about 20 inches and a circumference of about 62.8 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Bores <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> and <b>76</b>, passages <b>64</b>, <b>69</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, and conduits <b>62</b>, <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> typically each have a diameter of about ¼ inch. On the other hand, sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>and wear surface channels <b>61</b> each have a correspondingly smaller diameter such that the collective flow cross section, and thus flow of slurry S, in all of the sub-conduits <b>62</b> <i>a </i>and concordantly exiting from all of the wear surface channels <b>61</b> is approximately equal to the total flow cross section, and thus total flow of slurry S, in slurry conduit <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Slurry S may be any suitable chemical mechanical polishing liquid such as a caustic aqueous slurry containing finely divided abrasive particles, e.g., an aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) slurry containing colloidal silica as the abrasive material, an aqueous ferric nitrate slurry containing colloidal alumina as the abrasive material, an aqueous aluminum sulfate solution containing colloidal silica as the abrasive, or the like. For example, slurry S may be a 15% KOH aqueous solution (in 85% water) containing colloidal silica particles of about 0.2 micron average particle diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Typically, slurry S is dispensed at a temperature of about 15-50° C. and wafer surface WS is maintained in frictional contact with polishing pad <b>42</b> under a mechanical pressure (down force), e.g., of about 2-8 psi, such as about 5 psi, per the action of compressed air A exiting air conduit <b>71</b> at underside portion <b>58</b> <i>c </i>of carrier <b>58</b> in conventional manner. Similarly, ring <b>59</b> is maintained in frictional contact at wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>with polishing pad <b>42</b>, either without applying positive mechanical pressure thereto or under a mechanical pressure (down force), e.g., of about 2-10 psi, such as about 5 psi, per the downwardly pressing action of support beam <b>52</b> on spindle <b>56</b>, carrier <b>58</b> and ring <b>59</b> in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b> are in immediately facing adjacent relation to wafer surface periphery WP and centrally within the annular extent of wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b</i>, slurry S is not prevented by ring <b>59</b> from reaching the central area portion of wafer surface WS, nor is it pushed off of polishing pad <b>42</b> by the outer circumferential portion of ring <b>59</b>, thereby overcoming the pertinent prior art drawbacks noted above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ring <b>59</b> is typically formed of selectively sacrificially consumable plastic or ceramic abradable material in conventional manner, i.e., so as to undergo removal of material from wear surface <b>59</b> <i>b </i>thereof at a rate substantially matching the removal rate of material from wafer surface WS. Polishing pad <b>41</b> is commercially available as a polyurethane fibrous sheeting material designated IC 1000 (Rodel Inc., Del.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heat exchanger <b>65</b> is typically supplied with heated liquid, e.g., at a uniform flow rate of about 100-250 mL/min., such as hot glycol or hot water which is heated to about 25-50° C. in conventional manner, e.g., at a remote location on apparatus <b>40</b>, and fed as inflow I to heat exchanger <b>65</b> via inflow bore <b>74</b> and returned as outflow O via outflow bore <b>75</b> for reheating. However, the liquid fed to heat exchanger <b>65</b> may be cold liquid such as cold glycol or cold water, e.g., at about 15-20° C., where it is desired to maintain wafer W at a cool or cold temperature, depending on the particular CMP operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention thus provides a system for minimizing variation in the local removal rates of material from different parts of wafer W caused by variation in the amount and temperature of the slurry S actually coming into contact with the wafer surface WS being polished. This improves the within-wafer uniformity. The dispensing of slurry S from ring <b>59</b> to wafer W retained thereby, instead of from a remote stationary tube, inherently reduces consumption of slurry S to a minimum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By feeding slurry S through spindle <b>56</b> and carrier <b>58</b> to ring <b>59</b> and dispensing it from channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b>, it is introduced in immediate adjacency to wafer W during common rotation and oscillation of wafer W and ring <b>59</b>. Slurry S is supplied very close to wafer W in the same relative position from spaced apart channels <b>61</b> in ring <b>59</b>, i.e., irrespective of the rotational and/or oscillational movement position of wafer W and ring <b>59</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This dispensing of slurry S at the immediate site of use for CMP of wafer W minimizes any change, e.g., drop, in the slurry temperature from its predetermined temperature (set point) before slurry S contacts wafer W. Slurry S thus has a vastly improved chance of reaching the central portion of wafer surface WS so as to provide a concordantly improved degree of uniformity and rate of removal, especially for temperature sensitive CMP processes, while minimizing slurry usage and wastage. Due to the direct manner of feeding slurry S to wafer W within the confines of ring <b>59</b>, it desirably maintains its predetermined uniform pH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The system of the present invention also eliminates the need for a stand-alone slurry temperature adjusting, e.g., heating, module or heat exchanger, thus conserving floor space. Instead, heat exchanger <b>65</b> is located in carrier <b>58</b> immediately adjacent ring <b>59</b> and its dispensing channels <b>61</b> so as to provide slurry S immediately to wafer W without possible intervening undesired temperature change. The circulating inflow I and outflow O of the temperature adjusting fluid can be readily preheated or precooled external to carrier <b>58</b> but still within the confines of apparatus <b>40</b>, e.g., in the vicinity of support beam <b>52</b> by suitable means (not shown) in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, the entire temperature adjusting operation can be effected without increasing the predetermined floor space (footprint) already occupied by apparatus <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is clear that the system of the present invention is applicable to all CMP processes, with suitable attendant optimization depending on the pertinent temperature and flow rate sensitivity of the slurry S. In all cases, the CMP method can be carried out in apparatus <b>40</b> so as to maintain slurry S at a uniform flow rate, uniform temperature and uniform pH, and thus achieve uniform CMP of wafer W in a reproducible manner as desired in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, it can be appreciated that the specific embodiments described are merely illustrative of the general principles of the invention. Various modifications may be provided consistent with the principles set forth.</div>
