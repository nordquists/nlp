<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to chemical mechanical planarization applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of optimizing the chemical mechanical planarization of semiconductor wafers.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Semiconductor wafers are typically fabricated with multiple copies of a desired integrated circuit design that will later be separated and made into individual integrated circuit chips. A common technique for forming the circuitry on a semiconductor is photolithography. Part of the photolithography process requires that a special camera focus on the wafer to project an image of the circuit on the wafer. The ability of the camera to focus on the surface of the wafer is often adversely affected by inconsistencies or unevenness in the wafer surface. The need for a precise image projection is accentuated with the current drive toward smaller, more complex integrated circuit designs. Semiconductor wafers are also commonly constructed in layers, where a portion of a circuit is etched on a first level and conductive vias are made to connect up to the next level of the circuit. After each layer of the circuit is etched on the wafer, an oxide layer is put down that allows the vias to pass through the oxide layer while covering the rest of the previous circuit level. Each layer of the circuit can create or add unevenness to the wafer as it is constructed. These imperfections are preferably smoothed out before generating the next circuit layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) techniques are used to planarize the raw wafer and each layer of material added thereafter. Available CMP systems, commonly called wafer polishers, often use a rotating wafer holder that brings the wafer into contact with a polishing pad that is moving in the plane of the wafer surface to be planarized. When the polishing pad contacts the wafer surface, material is removed from the wafer thereby polishing the surface. In general, the three primary objectives of the CMP system are: (1) to planarize the surface of the wafer by removing portions of material that extend above the surface of the wafer; (2) to uniformly remove material from the entire surface of the wafer; and (3) polish the surface of the wafer to remove scratches or other defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polishing pads commonly used in this process include both belt-type pads and rotary-type pads. A. belt-type pad typically consists of one or more sections of material that are joined together to form a belt. The belt is placed around a plurality of rollers that cause the belt to rotate in a linear path. The rotating belt can then be brought into contact with the wafer to polish its surface. A rotary-type pad typically consists of one or more sections of material that are joined together to form a pad. The pad is attached to a rotary machine that rotates the pad to polish the surface of the wafer. A polishing fluid, such as a chemical polishing agent or slurry containing micro abrasives, can be used in conjunction with the polishing pad. The slurry is disposed between the polishing pad and the wafer and enhances the polishing of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In polishing a wafer, the type of pad used, the slurry used, and other polishing parameters can be changed to produce different polishing results. For example, the hardness, stiffness, and construction of the polishing pad can be changed to effect the polishing. Also, the slurry used to polish the wafer, the polishing time, and the polishing pressure can also be varied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The makeup of the wafer that is to be polished often dictates how the polishing parameters are selected. Different wafers and different layers within a wafer can have different compositions such as different materials, different patterns, and different pattern densities. Each of these different compositions can affect the polishing of the wafer and a specific combination of polishing parameters may be preferred for polishing a wafer that has a certain composition. Thus, selecting a combination of polishing parameters that will produce a desired result is important. However, current systems do not allow for an efficient and effect method of determining an optimum set of polishing parameters to achieve a desired polishing result. A method and system that overcomes these deficiencies is needed.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to one aspect of the invention, a wafer is polished using one set of polishing parameters, and a first polishing result can then be determined. The wafer is then polished using a second set of polishing parameters, wherein at least one of the first polishing parameters has been changed, and a second polishing result can be determined. The first and second polishing results can then be analyzed to determine an optimized set of polishing parameters. A second wafer can then be polishing using the optimized set of polishing parameters.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a belt-type polisher <b>10</b> for use in the present invention is shown. One example of a suitable belt-type polisher is the TERES<sup>TM </sup>polisher available from Lam Research Corporation of Freemont, California. The belt-type polisher <b>10</b> is utilized to polish a semiconductor wafer <b>12</b> to remove materials from the surface of the wafer. The belt-type polisher <b>10</b> comprises a polishing pad <b>14</b> which moves in a linear direction <b>20</b> with respect to the surface of the wafer <b>12</b>. The polishing pad <b>14</b> is a continuous belt rotating about rollers or spindles <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, which are driven by a motor that causes the rollers to rotate. The wafer <b>12</b> can be supported by a wafer carrier <b>22</b> and is positioned so that the surface of the wafer comes into contact with the surface of the polishing pad <b>14</b>. The movement of the polishing pad <b>14</b> removes material from the surface of the wafer <b>12</b>. The material being removed from the surface of the wafer <b>12</b> can be the substrate material of the wafer itself or one of the layers formed on the substrate. Such formed layers include dielectric materials such as silicon dioxide, metals such as aluminum, copper or tungsten, metal alloys or semiconductor material such as silicon or polisilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A slurry dispenser <b>24</b>, can be used to dispense a slurry <b>26</b> onto the polishing pad <b>14</b>. The slurry <b>26</b> is disposed between the wafer <b>12</b> and the polishing pad <b>14</b> and enhances the polishing of the wafer <b>12</b>. A platen <b>28</b> can also be used to support the underside of the polishing pad <b>14</b>. A primary purpose of the platen <b>28</b> is to provide a supporting platform on the underside of the polishing pad <b>14</b> to produce pressure that holds the polishing pad <b>14</b> against the wafer <b>12</b>. Typically, the wafer carrier <b>22</b> is pressed downward against the polishing pad <b>14</b> with a force. Since the polishing pad <b>14</b> is flexible and will depress when the wafer <b>12</b> is pressed downward onto the polishing pad <b>14</b>, the platen <b>28</b> provides a counteracting force to this downward force. Although the platen <b>28</b> can be a solid platform, a fluid type platen can also be used. One example of such a platen is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,568, which is incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer <b>12</b> preferably comprises a portion of semiconductor material. The wafer <b>12</b> can comprise a blanket wafer, which has no pattern formed therein. Alternatively, the wafer <b>12</b> can comprise a pattern wafer that has one or more patterns of circuits formed within the wafer <b>12</b>. In a pattern wafer, the circuits can be evenly or unevenly distributed throughout the wafer. Thus, the number of circuits present within a given section of the wafer, commonly known as the pattern density, can vary. As discussed below, the number of circuits present in the wafer <b>12</b> and the pattern density of the wafer <b>12</b> can affect the polishing of the wafer <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polishing pad <b>14</b> can comprise different constructions, different hardnesses, and different stiffnesses. For example, the polishing pad <b>14</b> is preferably constructed from a polyurethane based polishing material <b>40</b>, such as closed cell polyurethane, that is formed in a linear belt around a steel belt <b>42</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. One suitable closed cell polyurethane material is IC 1000, which is available from Rodel. Alternatively, the polishing pad <b>14</b> can be constructed from a plurality of layers of material <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, such as closed cell polyurethane over spongy or felt-like polyurethane, formed around a steel belt <b>42</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. One suitable felt-like polyurethane material is the 817 pad available from Thomas West. A polishing pad that includes both a closed cell polyurethane and a spongy or felt-like polyurethane material is commonly referred as a stacked pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hardness and stiffness of the polishing pad <b>14</b> can also vary. The material from which the polishing pad <b>14</b> is constructed often affects the hardness and the stiffness of the polishing pad <b>14</b>. For example, a polishing pad constructed from a single material, such as the one shown in FIG. 3, tends to be harder and stiffer than a polishing pad constructed from a plurality of materials, such as the one shown if FIG. <b>4</b>. While the hardness and the stiffness of the pad can be related, they can vary independently from one another. Also, the groove pattern formed in the pad can be altered. The number of grooves, width of grooves, space between grooves, and orientation of grooves can all be altered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The slurry <b>26</b> comprises a mixture of liquid and solid material that is used in conjunction with the polishing pad <b>14</b> to affect the polishing of the wafer <b>12</b>. The solid material can vary both in type and amount present in the slurry <b>26</b>. In addition, the chemical makeup of the slurry <b>26</b> can also vary based on the chemical content of the liquid and/or the chemical content of the solid material. For example the ionization and the pH of the slurry <b>26</b> can vary depending upon the chemical content of the liquid and/or the solid material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Changes in these, as well as other, polishing parameters can affect the polishing of the wafer <b>12</b>. For example, changes in these parameters can affect the planarization of the wafer surface, the uniformity of the removal of material from the wafer surface, and the presence of defects on the wafer surface. For example, a polishing pad <b>14</b> constructed from a single material, such as the one shown in FIG. 3, will have a longer planarization length than the polishing pad shown in FIG. 4, because it is harder and stiffer. The planarization length is the radius of the region surrounding an elevated portion of the surface that is not polished because the polishing pad does not contact the unpolished area. Because the planarization length is longer the polishing pad <b>14</b> doesn't conform to different regions within a wafer <b>14</b>, even if the pattern densities vary. Thus, this polishing pad evenly planarizes different parts of the wafer to produce an even wafer surface. Thus, the polishing pad shown if FIG. 3, can be preferred over the polishing pad shown in FIG. 4 for polishing wafers that have varying pattern densities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conversely, the stacked pad shown in FIG. 4 is effectively softer so that when pressure is applied to a local area of the polishing pad, the surrounding area is deformed. This makes the planarization length shorter for this polishing pad as compared to that of the polishing pad in FIG. <b>3</b>. Because the stacked pad conforms to the surface of the wafer more readily than the polishing pad in FIG. 3., the stacked pad removes material from the surface of the wafer more uniformly than the polishing pad in FIG. <b>3</b>. Thus, the stacked pad can be preferred for polishing wafers that have a consistent pattern density, but may not preferred for wafers with a low pattern density or varied pattern density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The makeup of the slurry <b>26</b> can affect the polishing of the wafer. In general, the greater the amount of solid material present in the slurry <b>26</b> results in a greater planarization efficiency. However, in increase in the amount of solid material present in the slurry <b>26</b> can have negative effects such as scratching of the wafer surface. Thus, the more liquid present in the slurry <b>26</b>, the better the polishing of the surface of the wafer without any results scratches or other defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of time that the polishing pad <b>14</b> is in contact with the wafer <b>12</b>, the polishing time, also affects the polishing of the wafer <b>12</b>. In general, the longer the wafer <b>12</b> is in contact with the polishing pad <b>14</b>, the greater the amount of polishing that will occur, assuming all other parameters remain constant. Also, the pressure at which the polishing pad <b>14</b> contacts the wafer <b>12</b>, the polishing pressure, can also affect polishing. In general, the greater the polishing pressure, the greater the polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, the ultimate goal of polishing a wafer <b>12</b> is to produce a wafer that meets certain tolerances set by a manufacturer. To achieve such a desired polishing result, the use of a combination of polishing parameters may be necessary. For example, to effectively: (a) planarize a wafer <b>12</b>; (b) uniformly remove material from the entire surface of the wafer <b>12</b>; and (c) remove any defects, may require the use of a plurality of polishing pads. A hard/stiff pad, such as the one shown in FIG. 3, can be used for a period of time to planarize the surface of the wafer. A soft pad, such as the one shown in FIG. 4, can be used to uniformly remove additional material from the surface of the wafer while also removing any defects. However, the exact combination of polishing parameters needed to attain an ultimate polishing result must be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 5, a method <b>100</b> of determining and optimized set of polishing parameters is shown necessary to achieve an ultimate polishing result is shown. The wafer <b>12</b> is polished for a first time using a first set of polishing parameters (act <b>110</b>). For example, the wafer can be polished using the following polishing parameters: (a) a polishing pad, such as the one shown in FIG. 3, can be used; (b) a specific slurry can be used; (c) the polishing can last for a certain amount of time; and (d) a certain polishing pressure can be used. After the first polishing is completed, the wafer <b>12</b> can be examined to determine a first polishing result (act <b>120</b>). For example, the removal rate, uniformity of polishing, planarization, and presence of defects can be determined by examining or measuring the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer <b>12</b> can then be polished using a second set pf polishing parameters (act <b>130</b>). The second set of polishing parameters preferably comprises the same set of parameters used in act <b>120</b>, with at least one of them being changed. For example, the wafer <b>12</b> can be polished using a polishing pad such as the one shown in FIG. 4, while all the other polishing parameters remain unchanged. After the second polishing is completed, the wafer <b>12</b> can be examined to determine a second polishing result (act <b>140</b>). For example, the removal rate, uniformity of polishing, planarization, and presence of defects can be determined by examining or measuring the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first and second polishing results can then be analyzed (act <b>150</b>) to determine an optimized set of polishing parameters (act <b>160</b>). Thus, in accordance with the above example involving two different polishing pads, the amount of time that each of the polishing pads should be used to achieve a desired result can be determined. A second wafer can then be polished using the optimized set of polishing parameters (act <b>170</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The analysis and determination in acts <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> can be done in a number of ways. For example, the first and second polishing results can be plotted on a graph where the removal of material, or other measure of polishing result, is opposed by the hardness, or other characteristics, of the polishing pad. An optimized polishing parameters can then be determined by analyzing the graph. Also, a linear approximation can be done to determine optimized polishing parameters. In an alternative embodiment, the determination can be done using a personal computer running a program written in Excel by Microsoft Corporation or another suitable program. The polishing results can be input into the program, which can determine an optimized set of polishing results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, a wafer can be polished using two different pads and removal rate profiles or uniformity profiles can be developed for each pad. The removal rate profile preferably represents how much material has been removed from each of several points that lie between the center and the edge of the wafer. The standard deviation of each of the removal rates that are used to generate the profile can also be determined. Assuming that the desired result in this example is to polish a wafer such that the removal rate varies as little as possible between the center and the edge, a weighted value can be calculated and assigned to each of the two pads that signifies that percentage or amount of time that each pad will be used in the polishing process. The total of the weighted values is preferably equal to 100. The weighted values can be determined by using a spreadsheet, such as Excel, to analyze the standard deviation data, which can be input into the spreadsheet, to produce a wafer having the desired surface characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In an alternative embodiment to the method depicted in FIG. 5, more than one of the first set of polishing parameters can be changed in the second set of polishing parameters. For example, the type of pad used and the slurry used in the first and second polishings can be changed. In addition, other combinations of polishing parameters can be changed in the first and second sets of polishing parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a further alternative embodiment, more than two different tests can be run on a wafer to determine an optimized set of polishing results. In a further alternative embodiment, a polisher including a rotary-type polishing pad can be used in place of the polishing pad shown in FIGS. 1-4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is to be understood that a wide range of changes and modifications to the embodiments described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are contemplated. It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of the invention.</div>
