<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to mechanical and chemical-mechanical planarization of microelectronic substrates. More particularly, the present invention relates to controlling the pH of a microelectronic substrate during planarization and post-planarization processing of the microelectronic substrate.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Mechanical and chemical-mechanical planarization processes remove material from the surfaces of semiconductor wafers, field emission displays, and many other microelectronic substrates to form a flat surface at a desired elevation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a planarizing machine <b>10</b> with a platen or base <b>20</b>, a carrier assembly <b>30</b>, a polishing pad <b>41</b> positioned on the platen <b>20</b>, and a planarizing liquid <b>44</b> on the polishing pad <b>41</b>. The planarizing machine <b>10</b> can also have an under-pad <b>25</b> attached to an upper surface <b>22</b> of the platen <b>20</b> for supporting the polishing pad <b>41</b>. In many planarizing machines, a drive assembly <b>26</b> rotates (arrow A) and/or reciprocates (arrow B) the platen <b>20</b> to move the polishing pad <b>41</b> during planarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The carrier assembly <b>30</b> controls and protects a substrate <b>12</b> during planarization. The carrier assembly <b>30</b> generally has a substrate holder <b>32</b> with a pad <b>34</b> that holds the substrate <b>12</b> via suction. A carrier drive assembly <b>36</b> typically rotates and/or translates the substrate holder <b>32</b> (arrows C and D, respectively). Alternatively, the substrate holder <b>32</b> can include a weighted, free-floating disk (not shown) that slides over the polishing pad <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The combination of the polishing pad <b>41</b> and the planarizing liquid <b>44</b> generally defines a planarizing medium <b>40</b> that mechanically and/or chemically-mechanically removes material from the surface of the substrate <b>12</b>. The polishing pad <b>41</b> may be a conventional polishing pad composed of a polymeric material (e.g., polyurethane) without abrasive particles, or it may be an abrasive polishing pad with abrasive particles fixedly bonded to a suspension material. In a typical application, the planarizing liquid <b>44</b> may be a chemical-mechanical planarization slurry with abrasive particles and chemicals for use with a conventional non-abrasive polishing pad. In other applications, the planarizing liquid <b>44</b> may be a chemical solution without abrasive particles for use with an abrasive polishing pad. In any case, the planarizing liquid <b>44</b> can be pumped from a planarizing liquid supply <b>45</b> through a conduit <b>46</b>, and through orifices <b>43</b> to a planarizing surface <b>42</b> of the polishing pad <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">To planarize the substrate <b>12</b> with the planarizing machine <b>10</b>, the carrier assembly <b>30</b> presses the substrate <b>12</b> against the planarizing surface <b>42</b> of the polishing pad <b>41</b> in the presence of the planarizing liquid <b>44</b>. The platen <b>20</b> and/or the substrate holder <b>32</b> then move relative to one another to translate the substrate <b>12</b> across the planarizing surface <b>42</b>. As a result, the abrasive particles and/or the chemicals of the planarizing medium <b>40</b> remove material from the surface of the substrate <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">After the substrate <b>12</b> has been planarized, particulate matter, such as abrasive particles, particles removed from the polishing pad <b>41</b>, and/or particles removed from the substrate <b>12</b> may adhere to the substrate. Accordingly, the substrate <b>12</b> can be rinsed to remove the particulate matter before the substrate <b>12</b> undergoes additional processing. One conventional approach to rinsing the substrate <b>12</b> is to pump a rinsing solution <b>53</b> from a rinsing solution supply <b>54</b> through the orifices <b>43</b> to the planarizing surface <b>42</b> of the polishing pad <b>41</b>. The rinsing solution <b>53</b> rinses the substrate <b>12</b> while the substrate remains in situ on the polishing pad <b>41</b>. The rinsing solution <b>53</b> may be introduced to the polishing pad <b>41</b> as the relative velocity between the substrate <b>12</b> and the polishing pad <b>41</b> is reduced or ramped down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Another rinsing approach, which can be used in addition to or in lieu of the in situ approach discussed above, can include removing the substrate <b>12</b> from the polishing pad <b>41</b> with a substrate transporter <b>60</b> and moving the substrate <b>12</b> to a rinse chamber <b>50</b>. The substrate transporter <b>60</b> can include a grasping device <b>62</b> that engages the substrate <b>12</b> after the substrate has been detached from the carrier assembly <b>30</b>. The substrate transporter <b>60</b> can further include one or more movable arms <b>61</b> that can robotically move the substrate <b>12</b> to the rinse chamber <b>50</b>. The rinse chamber <b>50</b> can include a plurality of opposing spray bars <b>51</b>, each having a plurality of nozzles <b>52</b> for directing a spray of the rinsing solution <b>53</b> onto the substrate <b>12</b>. The rinse chamber <b>50</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can simultaneously accommodate two substrates <b>12</b> positioned upright in adjacent bays <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">A third approach to removing particulate matter from the substrate <b>12</b> is to remove the substrate from the polishing pad <b>41</b> and place the substrate <b>12</b> on a separate buffing pad (not shown). The buffing pad then moves relative to the substrate and may also be supplied with a rinsing solution to convey the particulate matter away.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">After the substrate <b>12</b> has been planarized and rinsed, the polishing pad <b>41</b> can be conditioned to restore its ability to planarize additional substrates. Accordingly, the planarizing machine <b>10</b> can include a conditioner <b>70</b> that removes polishing pad material from the planarizing surface <b>42</b> to expose new polishing pad material. The conditioner <b>70</b> can include an abrasive disk <b>71</b> for mechanically roughening the planarizing surface <b>42</b> of the polishing pad <b>41</b>. The conditioner <b>70</b> can also include a conditioning fluid source <b>72</b> that supplies conditioning fluid to the polishing pad <b>41</b> for chemically conditioning the planarizing surface <b>42</b> of the polishing pad <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Planarizing processes must consistently and accurately produce a uniformly planar surface on the microelectronic substrate <b>12</b> to enable precise fabrication of circuits and photo-patterns. As the density of integrated circuits increases, the uniformity and planarity of the substrate surface is becoming increasingly important because it is difficult to form sub-micron features or photo-patterns to within a tolerance of approximately 0.1 microns on non-uniform substrate surfaces. Thus, planarizing processes must create a highly uniform, planar surface on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">One drawback with the conventional methods discussed above is that they may not create a sufficiently planer surface on the substrate because particulates may remain attached to the substrate as a result of contact between the substrate <b>12</b> and a variety of chemical solutions during and after planarization. For example, in one conventional method the planarizing solution is an ammonia-based solution, and the rinsing and conditioning fluids are deionized water. Each chemical solution may have different chemical characteristics and sequentially exposing the microelectronic substrate <b>12</b> to different chemical solutions may cause particulates to adhere to the surfaces of the substrate. These particulates may damage the wafer during subsequent polishing and handling steps, or may interfere with subsequent processing steps, such as masking and etching. Furthermore, the particulates may become incorporated into the devices formed on the substrate, potentially causing the devices to fail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In the competitive semiconductor and microelectronic device manufacturing industries, it is desirable to maximize the throughput of finished substrates. Accordingly, a further drawback with the conventional processes described above is that they may require additional time to remove the particulates from the substrate. The additional time can be required because the substrate has additional particulate adhered to it as a result of exposure to various chemical solutions.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The present invention is directed toward methods and apparatuses or processing a microelectronic substrate. In one embodiment, the apparatus can include a polishing pad having a planarizing surface and a source of planarizing liquid in fluid communication with the planarizing surface of the polishing pad. The microelectronic substrate is planarized by engaging the substrate with the polishing pad while the planarizing liquid is disposed on the polishing pad, and moving one of the substrate and the polishing pad relative to the other of the substrate and the polishing pad. As the relative motion between the substrate and the polishing pad is decreased, rinsing fluid having a pH approximately the same as a pH of the planarizing liquid can be introduced to the planarizing surface to maintain the pH of the microelectronic substrate at an approximately constant level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In another embodiment, the microelectronic substrate can be removed from the polishing pad and rinsed remotely with a rinsing liquid having a pH approximately the same as a pH of the planarizing liquid. The rinsing liquid in either of the foregoing embodiments can be selected to include tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide and deionized water, or other substances where a pH of the rinsing liquid is approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In still another embodiment, the polishing pad can include a non-abrasive polishing pad and the planarizing liquid can include an abrasive slurry. The pH of the microelectronic substrate can be maintained by maintaining the pH of the abrasive slurry at an approximately constant level as the relative velocity between the microelectronic substrate and the polishing pad is reduced to approximately zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the polishing pad can be conditioned by supplying to the polishing pad a conditioning liquid having a pH approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid. In still a further embodiment, the microelectronic substrate can be cleaned by engaging the microelectronic substrate with the polishing pad, after the polishing pad has been conditioned, and moving at least one of the polishing pad and the substrate relative to the other of the polishing pad and the substrate.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The present invention is an apparatus and method for mechanical and/or chemical-mechanical planarization of substrates used in the manufacture of microelectronic devices. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments or that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic side elevation view of a CMP machine <b>110</b> having a platen <b>120</b> and a planarizing medium <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, the CMP machine can include a model number 676 manufactured by IPEC Corp. of Portland, Oreg., and in other embodiments, the CMP machine can include other devices, such as a web-format planarizing machine, manufactured by EDC Corporation. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the planarizing medium <b>140</b> includes a polishing pad <b>141</b> and an under-pad <b>125</b> releasably attached to the platen <b>120</b>. The planarizing medium can further include a planarizing liquid <b>144</b> disposed on a planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad <b>141</b>. The platen <b>120</b> can be movable by means of a platen drive assembly <b>126</b> that can impart a rotational motion (indicated by arrow A) and/or a translational motion (indicated by arrow B) to the platen <b>120</b>. As was discussed above, the CMP apparatus <b>110</b> can also include a carrier assembly <b>130</b> having a substrate holder <b>132</b> and a resilient pad <b>134</b> that together press a microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> against the planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad <b>141</b>. A carrier drive assembly <b>136</b> can be coupled to the carrier assembly <b>130</b> to move the carrier assembly axially (indicated by arrow C) and/or rotationally (indicated by arrow D) relative to the platen <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The planarizing liquid <b>144</b> can be supplied to the polishing pad <b>141</b> from a planarizing liquid supply <b>145</b> via a conduit <b>146</b>. In one embodiment, the conduit <b>146</b> can include a flexible coupling <b>147</b>, shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to allow for translational or rotational motion of the platen <b>120</b> relative to the planarizing liquid supply <b>145</b>. The coupling <b>147</b> can be connected to a manifold <b>148</b> in the platen <b>120</b>. The manifold <b>148</b> can include a plurality of orifices <b>143</b> that extend upwardly through the under-pad <b>145</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b> to the planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad. As the carrier assembly <b>130</b> moves relatively to the platen <b>120</b>, the planarizing medium <b>140</b> (i.e., the polishing pad <b>141</b> and/or the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>) removes material from the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b>. The process may also cause material to be removed from the polishing pad <b>141</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Particulates removed from the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b>, as well as abrasive elements in the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> may tend to adhere to the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b>. Accordingly, the CMP machine <b>110</b> can include a rinsing liquid <b>153</b> that is pumped from a rinsing liquid supply <b>154</b> through the conduit <b>146</b> to the orifices <b>143</b> in the polishing pad <b>141</b>. The conduit <b>146</b> can include a valve <b>149</b> that can be adjusted to couple the rinsing liquid supply <b>154</b> and/or the planarizing liquid supply <b>145</b> with the orifices <b>143</b>, to selectively provide rinsing liquid <b>153</b> and/or planarizing fluid <b>144</b> to the polishing pad <b>141</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">It has been observed that particulates adjacent to the substrate <b>112</b> may have a greater tendency to adhere to the substrate <b>112</b> when the pH of the substrate changes suddenly. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> is selected to have a pH approximately the same as a pH of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>, to maintain the pH of the substrate <b>112</b> at an approximately constant level as the substrate <b>112</b> is exposed to the rinsing liquid <b>153</b>. In one embodiment, the CMP machine <b>110</b> can include a pH meter <b>158</b> coupled to the rinsing liquid supply <b>154</b> and the planarizing liquid supply <b>145</b> to monitor the pH levels of both liquids. The pH meter can include a conductivity meter or other device that detects pH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In one embodiment, the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> can include Klebosol, an ammonia-based solution available from Rodel Corp. of Newark, Del. having a pH in the range of approximately 10.6 to approximately 11.4, and more particularly, approximately 11.0. The pH of the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can be selected to have a pH in approximately the same range. In one embodiment, the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can include a mixture of deionized water provided by a deionized water supply <b>155</b> and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) provided by a TMAH supply <b>156</b>. The relative amount of deionized water and TMAH included in the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can be controlled by adjusting a rinsing liquid valve <b>157</b> coupled between the deionized water supply <b>155</b> and the TMAH supply <b>156</b>. In one embodiment, the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can include 99.994% deionized water and 0.006% TMAH by volume, to have a pH of approximately 11.0. In other embodiments, the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> and the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can include other compositions having other pHs, so long as the pH of the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> is selected to be approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In another aspect of this embodiment, the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can be selected to have an electrical charge that is approximately the same as an electric charge of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the electrical charge of the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> and the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> can be selected to be approximately zero to reduce the likelihood of imparting unwanted electrical charges to the substrate <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>112</b>, the rinsing liquid <b>153</b>, and/or the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> can have other non-zero electrical charges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The CMP machine <b>110</b> can also include a substrate transporter <b>160</b> and a rinse chamber <b>150</b>. As was discussed above, the substrate transporter <b>160</b> can include a plurality of articulated movable arms <b>161</b> coupled to a grasping device <b>162</b>. The grasping device <b>162</b> can engage the substrate <b>112</b> after it has been released from the carrier assembly <b>130</b> and the arms <b>161</b> can be controlled to robotically transfer the substrate <b>112</b> to the rinse chamber <b>150</b>. The rinse chamber <b>150</b> can include spray bars <b>151</b> positioned on opposite sides of adjacent rinse bays <b>157</b>. The spray bars <b>151</b> can direct the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> through nozzles <b>152</b> toward the substrate <b>112</b> to clean opposing surfaces of the substrate <b>112</b> when the substrate is positioned in one of the rinse bays <b>157</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The rinsing liquid <b>153</b> can have a pH that is approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>, to maintain the pH of the substrate <b>112</b> at an approximately constant level for an additional portion of the post-planarization processing operation. In one aspect of this embodiment, the rinsing fluid <b>153</b> can be supplied from the same rinsing liquid supply <b>154</b> that supplies rinsing liquid the polishing pad <b>141</b>. Accordingly, the valve <b>149</b> can be adjustable to provide the rinsing solution <b>153</b> to the polishing pad <b>141</b> and/or the rinsing chamber <b>153</b>, as well as provide the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> to the polishing pad <b>141</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In operation, the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> is pumped from the planarizing liquid supply <b>145</b> through the orifices <b>143</b>. The microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> engages the planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad <b>141</b> while the platen <b>120</b> and/or the carrier assembly <b>130</b> are moved relative to each other to planarize the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b>. As the planarizing process nears completion, the relative velocity between the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b> is ramped down or reduced to zero by gradually halting the motion of the platen <b>120</b> and/or the carrier assembly <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">As the relative velocity between the substrate <b>112</b> and the platen <b>120</b> decreases, the flow of planarizing liquid <b>144</b> is halted and the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> is supplied to the polishing pad <b>141</b>. In one embodiment, the time required to halt the relative motion between the substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b> (and accordingly, the time during which the substrate <b>112</b> is rinsed on the polishing pad <b>141</b>), is in the range of approximately twenty to approximately forty seconds, and preferably approximately forty seconds. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>112</b> can be rinsed on the polishing pad <b>141</b> for greater or lesser periods of time, depending upon, for example, the initial relative velocity between the substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b>, the normal force between the substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b>, and the fluid characteristics of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> and the rinsing liquid <b>153</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Once the relative motion between the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing pad <b>141</b> is halted, the carrier assembly <b>130</b> disengages from the substrate <b>112</b> and the substrate transporter <b>160</b> engages the substrate <b>112</b> and removes the substrate from the polishing pad <b>141</b>. The substrate transporter <b>160</b> moves the substrate <b>112</b> to the rinse chamber <b>150</b> where the substrate is sprayed with the rinsing solution <b>153</b>. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>112</b> can be rinsed for approximately five seconds in the rinse chamber, and in other embodiments, the substrate may be rinsed for greater or lesser periods of times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">An advantage of the CMP machine <b>110</b> and the process described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the substrate <b>112</b> can be maintained at an approximately constant pH level throughout the planarization, ramp down, and rinsing operations. This is advantageous because particulate matter, such as material removed from the substrate <b>112</b>, material removed from the polishing pad <b>141</b>, and/or abrasive particles in the planarizing liquid <b>144</b> may be less likely to adhere to the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> when the pH of the substrate <b>112</b> remains approximately constant. Accordingly, the likelihood of contaminating the substrate <b>112</b> with particulate matter can be substantially reduced, increasing the number of defect-free substrates. The absence of particulate matter may also be advantageous because post-CMP processing steps, such as masking, may be more accurately performed without the interference created by the particulate matter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Another advantage of the CMP machine <b>110</b> and process described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the machine can increase the throughput of substrates <b>112</b>. For example, conventional CMP methods that include changing the pH of the substrate <b>112</b> before all of the particulates have been removed may require that the substrate be rinsed in a rinse chamber for approximately thirty seconds. By contrast, the process described above can include rinse times in the rinse chamber <b>150</b> on the order of approximately five seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the CMP machine <b>110</b> can be operated in accordance with another embodiment of the invention by supplying the planarizing fluid <b>144</b> to the polishing pad <b>141</b> during both the planarization and ramp-down steps. Accordingly, the pH of the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> can remain approximately constant during both the planarization and ramp-down steps. The substrate <b>112</b> can then be moved directly to the rinse chamber <b>150</b> and rinsed with the rinsing liquid <b>153</b> without first rinsing the substrate <b>112</b> on the polishing pad <b>141</b>. An advantage of this process is that it does not require the rinsing solution supply <b>154</b> to be coupled to the polishing pad <b>141</b>, potentially simplifying the CMP machine <b>110</b>. Conversely, an advantage of rinsing the substrate <b>112</b> on the polishing pad <b>141</b> before moving the substrate to the rinse chamber <b>150</b> is that the additional rinse step may increase the likelihood that any particulate matter adhering to the substrate <b>112</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic side elevation view of a CMP machine <b>210</b> having a conduit <b>246</b> that delivers fluid downwardly onto the planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad <b>141</b>, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Accordingly, an advantage of the CMP machine <b>210</b> when compared with the CMP machine <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the need for orifices <b>143</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a manifold <b>148</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is eliminated, potentially simplifying the construction and maintenance of the CMP machine <b>210</b>. Conversely, an advantage of the CMP machine <b>110</b> is that it may more uniformly distribute the planarizing fluid <b>144</b> over the planarizing surface <b>142</b>, and may distribute the planarizing fluid <b>144</b> independent of the location of the carrier assembly <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">As is also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the CMP machine <b>210</b> can include a conditioner <b>270</b> to refurbish the polishing pad <b>141</b> after planarization. In one embodiment, the conditioner <b>270</b> can include an abrasive disk <b>271</b> that roughens the planarizing surface <b>142</b> of the polishing pad <b>141</b> and removes polishing pad material from the planarizing surface. The conditioner <b>270</b> can also include a conditioning fluid source <b>272</b> in addition to or in lieu of the abrasive disk <b>271</b>, for removing polishing pad material from the polishing pad <b>141</b>. In one embodiment, the conditioning fluid can be chemically active to chemically remove the polishing material. In another embodiment, the conditioning fluid can be chemically inactive, but can act to flush the removed polishing pad material away from the polishing pad <b>141</b>. In either case, a pH of the conditioning fluid can be selected to be approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>. For example, the conditioning fluid can have the same chemical composition as the rinsing liquid <b>153</b>. Accordingly, the conditioning fluid can be supplied by the rinsing solution supply <b>154</b> in one embodiment and the separate conditioning fluid source <b>172</b> can be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In operation, the CMP machine <b>210</b> can be initially operated according to the steps discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to planarize the substrate <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>112</b> can be moved directly to the rinse chamber after planarization (as was generally discussed above with reference to FIG. <b>2</b>). Alternatively, the polishing pad <b>141</b> can be conditioned after planarization, and the substrate <b>112</b> can be buffed or cleaned on the conditioned polishing pad <b>141</b>. For example, the polishing pad <b>141</b> can be conditioned by moving the abrasive disk <b>271</b> over the planarizing surface <b>142</b> and/or by flushing the planarizing surface <b>142</b> with the conditioning liquid. After the conditioning step has been completed, the substrate <b>112</b> can be buffed by moving the substrate <b>112</b> relative to the newly conditioned planarizing surface <b>142</b> in the presence of the rinsing solution <b>153</b>. The buffing step can remove substrate material from the substrate <b>112</b> and/or can remove particulates that adhere to the surface of the substrate <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the ramp-down time can be reduced from a range of twenty to forty seconds to a range of approximately ten to approximately thirty seconds (preferably approximately fifteen seconds) when the ramp-down step is followed by the buffing step. Optionally, the substrate <b>112</b> can then be rinsed in the rinse chamber <b>150</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">One advantage of the CMP machine <b>210</b> and the process discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the conditioning fluid has a pH approximately the same as the pH of the planarizing liquid <b>144</b>. Accordingly, the pH of the polishing pad <b>141</b> can be maintained at an approximately constant level, increasing the likelihood that the substrates <b>112</b> contacting the polishing pad <b>141</b> also remain at an approximately constant pH. As discussed above, keeping the pH of the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> at an approximately constant level can reduce the tendency for particulate matter to adhere to the substrate <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Another advantage of the process described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the microelectronic substrate <b>112</b> can be buffed on the same polishing pad <b>141</b> as was used to planarize the substrate <b>112</b>, unlike some conventional methods which require a separate buffing pad. This is advantageous because it can reduce the number of pads necessary for CMP and post-CMP processing, and can also increase throughput by eliminating the step of moving the wafer from the polishing pad to a separate buffing pad.</div>
