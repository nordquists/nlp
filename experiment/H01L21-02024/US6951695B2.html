<heading>GOVERNMENT RIGHTS IN INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The invention disclosed herein includes aspects that were involved in the performance of United States Contract No. DASG60-00-C-0036 issued by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and United States Contract No. N00014-00-3-0013 issued by The Office of Naval Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">This invention relates to Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (wherein 0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦z≦1, and x+y+z=1) having superior surface quality, including in various embodiments, articles formed of such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N material, e.g., in wafer form, including surfaces comprising crystallographic plane surfaces and offcuts of such crystallographic plane surfaces that are suitable for fabrication of microelectronic and optoelectronic device structures. The invention also relates to methods for fabricating such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles and surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">GaN and related GaN-like III-V nitride crystal films, represented by the general formula Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N, where 0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦z≦1, and x+y+z=1, are useful materials in various applications, such as high temperature electronics, power electronics, and optoelectronics (e.g., light emitting diodes (LEDs) and blue light laser diodes (LDs)). Blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers are an enabling technology, allowing much higher storage density in magneto-optic memories and CDROMs and the construction of full color light emitting displays. Blue light emitting diodes may replace currently employed incandescent light bulbs in road and railway signals etc., since in such applications blue light emitting diodes have the potential to achieve very substantial cost and energy savings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Currently, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N films are grown on non-native substrates such as sapphire or silicon carbide, due to unavailability of high quality Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N substrates. However, differences in thermal expansion and lattice constants between such foreign substrates and the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals epitaxially grown thereon cause significant thermal stress and internal stress in the grown Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals. The thermal stress and internal stress cause micro-cracks, distortions, and other defects in the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals, and make such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals easy to break. Growing on lattice non-matched foreign substrates also causes high density of lattice defects, leading to poor device performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In order to reduce the deleterious thermal stress and high defect density in the grown Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals, it is desirable to provide high quality freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers as film-growing substrates, in place of the above-mentioned foreign substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,152 entitled “Method for Making a Single Crystal Ga*N Article” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/955,168 filed Oct. 21, 1997 entitled “Bulk Single Crystal Gallium Nitride and Method of Making Same” disclose hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) processes for fabricating freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals as substrates for homoepitaxial growth of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N single crystal material thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Since quality of a subsequently grown Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal is directly correlated to the quality of the substrate surface and near surface region on which the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal is grown, it is important to provide a highly smooth initial substrate surface without any surface or subsurface damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">However, after mechanical polishing, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals typically have very poor surface quality, with substantial surface and subsurface damage and polishing scratches. Additional wafer finish processing therefore is necessary to further enhance the surface quality of the freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal, so that it is suitable for high-quality epitaxial growth and device fabrication thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Crystalline Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N generally exists in a chemically stable wurtzite structure. The most common crystallographic orientation of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N compounds has two polar surfaces perpendicular to its c-axis: one side is N-terminated, and the other one is Ga-terminated (Ga hereinafter in the context of the Ga-side of the crystal structure being understood as generally illustrative and representative of alternative Group III (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N) crystalline compositions, e.g., of a corresponding Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>-side in Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>N crystals, of a corresponding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>-side in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals, of a corresponding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>-side in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>N crystals, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Crystal polarity strongly influences the growth morphology and chemical stability of the crystal surface. It has been determined that the N-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal is chemically reactive with KOH or NaOH-based solutions, whereas the Ga-side of such crystal is very stable and not reactive with most conventional chemical etchants. The N-side can therefore be easily polished, using an aqueous solution of KOH or NaOH, to remove surface damage and scratches left by the mechanical polishing process and to obtain a highly smooth surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The Ga-side (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z </sub>side) of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal, on the other hand, remains substantially the same after contacting the KOH or NaOH solution, with its surface damage and scratches unaltered by such solution. See Weyher et al., “Chemical Polishing of Bulk and Epitaxial GaN”, J. Crystal Growth, vol. 182, pp. 17-22, 1997; also see Porowski et al. International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/45511 entitled “Mechano-Chemical Polishing of Crystals and Epitaxial Layers of GaN and Ga<sub>1−x−y</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>N”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">However, it has been determined that the Ga-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal is a better film-growing surface than the N-side. See Miskys et al., “MOCVD-Epitaxy on Free-Standing HVPE-GaN Substrates”, Phys. Stat. Sol. (A), vol. 176, pp. 443-46, 1999. It therefore is important to provide a wafer finish process that is particularly effective for preparing the Ga-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal to make it suitable for subsequent crystal growth thereupon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Reactive ion etching (RIE) recently has been used to remove a layer of surface material from the Ga-side of an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer to obtain smoother wafer surface. See Karouta et al., “Final Polishing of Ga-Polar GaN Substrates Using Reactive Ion Etching”, J. Electronic Materials, vol. 28, pp. 1448-51, 1999. However, such RIE process is unsatisfactory because it is ineffective for removing deeper scratches, and it introduces additional damage by ion bombardment and additional surface irregularities by concomitant contamination, which in turn requires additional cleaning of the GaN wafer in an O<sub>2 </sub>plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">It is therefore advantageous to provide an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer with high surface quality on its Ga-side, with substantially no or little surface and subsurface damage or contamination. It is also desirable that such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is prepared by a surface polishing process that is both economic and effective, and requires no cumbersome cleaning process during or after polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">More generally, even though there is a particular need in the art for a surface polishing process that produces high surface quality on the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>-terminated side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N(0001) substrate, since such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>-terminated surface is the most chemically stable surface, there is also a continuing need in the art for Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer articles with high surface quality on other crystallographic surfaces and offcuts of such surfaces, e.g., non-polar a-axis surfaces, N-terminated (0001) surfaces, A-plane surfaces, M-plane surfaces, R-plane surfaces, and offcuts of the foregoing surfaces.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The present invention generally relates to Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (wherein 0≦y≦1 and x+y+z=1) having superior surface quality, including in various embodiments, device fabrication surfaces comprising crystallographic plane surfaces and offcuts of such crystallographic plane surfaces, and to methods of fabricating such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N material in wafer form with surfaces suitable for microelectronic and/or optoelectronic device manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">One aspect of the present invention relates to a high quality Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer having a surface roughness characterized by a root means square (RMS) roughness of less than 1 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area, e.g., at its Ga-side, at its N-side, at offcuts of (0001) surfaces, at A-plane surfaces, at M-plane surfaces, at R-plane surfaces, at offcuts of A-plane surfaces, at offcuts of M-plane surfaces, and/or at offcuts of R-plane surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Although described hereinafter with illustrative reference to Ga-side surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles, it will be understood that the polished surface articles of the invention, and the chemical mechanical polishing compositions and their methods of use, broadly encompass and relate to surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N other than the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>-terminated side of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N(0001) articles, such as the N-terminated side of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N(0001) articles, and offcuts of (0001) surfaces, as well as A-, M- and R-plane surfaces, and offcuts of such respective A-, M- and R-plane surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Accordingly, subsequent references to Ga-side surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles in the disclosure hereof will be understood as being representative of and alternatively applicable to such other surfaces, e.g., N-terminated surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N(0001) articles, offcuts of (0001) surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N(0001) articles, as well as A-, M- and R-plane surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles, and offcuts of such respective A-, M- and R-plane surfaces of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The invention provides Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles of superior RMS surface roughness characteristics, such as Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers having a surface, e.g., the exemplary Ga-side surface, useful for fabrication of microelectronic devices, optoelectronic devices, or corresponding device precursor structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In ranges of progressively increasing preference, the RMS surface roughness of such wafer, e.g., at its Ga-side, is within the following ranges: (1) less than 0.7 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area; (2) less than 0.5 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area; (3) less than 0.4 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area; (4) less than 0.2 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area; and (5) less than 0.15 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers according to the present invention preferably are characterized by a regular step structure at the Ga-side thereof when observed by atomic force microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers according to the present invention preferably are characterized by the crystal defects of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer at its Ga-side constituting small pits with diameters of less than 1 μm. Small pits of such size are readily visible by both atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques, while at the same time these pits do not constitute significant damage of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer surface and therefore do not impair quality of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals subsequently grown thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Such high quality Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal wafers are readily manufactured by chemically mechanically polishing (CMP) of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blanks, using silica or alumina-containing CMP slurry compositions. The corresponding CMP process enables the crystal defects of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer (evidenced by small pits of less than 1 μm in diameter) to be readily visualized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Another aspect of the present invention relates to an epitaxial Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystal structure, comprising an epitaxial Al<sub>x′</sub>Ga<sub>y′</sub>In<sub>z′</sub>N (wherein 0≦y′≦1 and x′+y′+z′=1) film grown on the above-described Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer of the invention. Such epitaxial Al<sub>x′</sub>Ga<sub>y′</sub>In<sub>z′</sub>N crystal structure preferably comprises a wurtzite crystalline thin film, but may be in any other suitable form or structure suitable for specific semiconductor, electronic, or optoelectronic applications. The composition of the epitaxial film may be or may not be the same as the composition of the wafer substrate. The epitaxial Al<sub>x′</sub>Ga<sub>y′</sub>In<sub>z′</sub>N crystal structure may comprise several epitaxial Al<sub>x′</sub>Ga<sub>y′</sub>In<sub>z′</sub>N films with different composition or doping, sequentially grown on the above-described Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer of the invention. The epitaxial film may have graded composition, i.e., the composition of the epitaxial film varies with the distance from the interface between the substrate and epitaxial film. As used herein, the term “thin film” means a material layer having a thickness of less than about 100 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to an optoelectronic device that comprises at least one such epitaxial Al<sub>x′</sub>Ga<sub>y′</sub>In<sub>z′</sub>N crystal structure grown on the above-described Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer of the invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Thermal annealing can be carried out at elevated temperature conditions, e.g., from about 700° C. to about 1600° C., at appropriate pressure (which in various embodiments may be atmospheric pressure, sub-atmospheric pressure, or superatmospheric pressure), in nitrogen, ammonia or any other suitable environment, for sufficient time to effect the desired nature and extent of thermal annealing, e.g., a time of from about 1 minute to about 1 hour in some embodiments, or greater periods in other embodiments, with the choice of specific annealing process conditions being readily determinable by simple experiment involving variation of process conditions and characterization of the annealed product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Chemical etching of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer functions to remove a layer of surface material from said wafer, thereby relaxing the internal stress of said wafer. It is preferred that the chemical etching process effect a removal of surface material of less than 100 μm thickness from the wafer, and more preferably less than 10 μm thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer can be chemically etched at elevated temperature by a very strong acid, e.g., sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, combinations thereof, etc., or by a very strong base, e.g., molten KOH or NaOH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Lapping slurry compositions advantageously used in the practice of the present invention can comprise any suitable abrasives, including, but not limited to, diamond powders, silicon carbide powders, boron carbide powders, and alumina powders. Preferably, the lapping slurry comprises diamond powder having an average particle size in a range of from about 6 μm to about 10 μm. More preferably, two or more lapping slurries lap the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank, with each subsequent lapping slurry comprising abrasives of a progressively smaller average particle size. For example, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank may be lapped by a first slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 8 μm to about 10 μm, and then by a second slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 5 μm to about 7 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Similarly, mechanical polishing slurries useful in the practice of the present invention may comprise any suitable abrasives, including but not limited to diamond powders, silicon carbide powders, boron carbide powders, and alumina powders. Diamond powders with an average particle size in a range of from about 0.1 μm to about 3 μm are particularly preferred. The mechanical polishing step may also employ two or more mechanical polishing slurries, with each subsequent mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of a progressively smaller average particle size. For example, a first mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 2.5 μm to about 3.5 μm can be used, followed by a second mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 0.75 μm to about 1.25 μm, followed by a third mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 0.35 μm to about 0.65 μm, followed by a fourth mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 0.2 μm to about 0.3 μm, and finally by a fifth mechanical polishing slurry comprising abrasives of an average particle size of from about 0.1 μm to about 0.2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The CMP slurry comprises at least one chemical reactant, e.g., an acid or a base in an amount yielding a pH in a range of 0≦pH&lt;7 for acidic CMP slurry compositions, or a pH in a range of 7&lt;pH≦14 for basic CMP slurry compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">After the CMP, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer may be subjected to additional processing for further reducing the stress of the wafer and improving the surface quality. A mild etching may be effective for this purpose. The mild etching may for example remove some residual surface damage on a Ga-side surface resulting from final CMP polishing while not etching the undamaged surface of such Ga-side, thereby improving the surface quality of the wafer. The mild etching can also remove the damage on an N-side surface, thus reduce the stress on the wafer caused by surface damage. Mild etching can also be employed to produce a matte finish on the N-side surface. For example, the wafer can be slightly etched in an aqueous solution of base (for example, KOH or NaOH) or an aqueous solution of acid (for example, HF, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) at a temperature below the boiling point of the aqueous solution, typically about 100° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of fabricating a laser facet on an article formed of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wherein 0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦z≦1, and x+y+z=1. The method comprises chemically mechanically polishing the article at a surface thereof using a chemical mechanical polishing slurry including silica and/or alumina abrasive particles, and an acid or base, wherein the chemically mechanically polishing step is carried out to impart to the surface a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of less than 1 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">A still further aspect of the invention relates to chemically mechanically polishing Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N, wherein 0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦z≦1 and x+y+z=1, using a chemical mechanical polishing slurry including silica and/or alumina abrasive particles, and an acid or base, wherein the chemically mechanically polishing step is carried out to impart to the surface a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of less than 1 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area thereof. Such methodology may be employed for processing of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers, e.g., in the fabrication of such wafers in a wafer fab, for planarization of such wafers, or for replanarization of such wafers, reworking of wafers to remove undesired layers or material therefrom, etc.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION, AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS THEREOF</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Fabrication of high quality Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers in accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention is readily achieved by processing steps as hereinafter more fully described, including fabrication of freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blanks, lapping, mechanical polishing, chemical mechanical polishing, and reduction of internal stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blanks are obtained by any of various suitable methods. One method involves first growing an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N boule and then slicing it into wafer blanks. Another method for producing Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blanks utilizes the steps of: (1) growing a thick Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N film on a foreign substrate, using a suitable method such as hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), the metallorganic chloride (MOC) method, metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), sublimation, etc.; and then (2) removing the foreign substrate from the thick Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N film, by polishing or etching the foreign substrate, by a laser-induced liftoff process, or other suitable technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">By way of example, GaN films of about 400 μm thickness can be grown on sapphire substrates using HVPE process techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Marks such as flats are made on the wafer to identify the crystal orientation of such wafer blank. The Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank can be sized into a round shape by, for example, particle beams, to facilitate subsequent mounting or processing of the wafer blank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Mounting of the freestanding Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank to a fixture enables it to be readily lapped or polished as necessary. The wafer blank can be mounted on a template with recesses for holding the wafer blank. Alternatively, the wafer blank can be mounted on a flat template, by, for example, (1) heating such template on a hotplate, (2) applying wax onto such template, and (3) pressing the wafer blank against the waxed template. After the template cools down, the wax solidifies and functions to hold the wafer blank on the template.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">When the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank is obtained from a Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N boule and is relatively thick and uniform, a recessed template can be used for mounting such wafer blank, which is advantageous over waxed templates in respect of shorter process times, easier demounting, and reduced contamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">On the other hand, for Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blanks which may be more fragile, thinner, or less uniform in thickness, for example, wafer blanks obtained from HVPE processes, the use of recessed templates may be less preferred due to the associated risk of breaking the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer during the lapping and/or polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The fixture used for mounting the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank can be of any suitable type appropriate to, and compatible with, the respective lapping or polishing apparatus. For the purpose of improving thickness uniformity of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer, a special lapping fixture comprising three adjustable diamond stops defining a plane can be utilized. The plane defined by the stops is parallel to the fixture surface, at a predetermined distance away from the surface. Such predetermined distance defines a minimum thickness of the lapped Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer, because the three diamond stops function as stop points preventing further removal of surface material from the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">In case the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank is slightly bowed or otherwise distorted due to internal stress present therein, it is preferable to dispose a weight on the wafer blank during the wafer being wax-mounted on the template. The type and amount of weight for such purpose is readily determinable within the skill of the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">After the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank is appropriately mounted, the wafer blank can be lapped by pressing it against a lapping plate, with abrasive particles embedded on surface of such lap plate, to produce a flat surface on the wafer. The pressure on the wafer may be adjusted to control the lapping process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">When using the same abrasives and lap plate rotation rates, the lapping rates of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank increase with increasing particle size of the abrasive. Larger abrasive particles thus result in a higher lapping rate, but produce rougher lapped surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Lapping rates also depend on the hardness of abrasive material used. For example, diamond powders have higher lapping rates than silicon carbide powders, which in turn have higher lapping rates than alumina powders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Lapping rates also depend on the type of lapping plates employed. For example, a copper lapping plate has a lower lapping rate than that of a cast iron plate, but the copper lapping plate yields a smoother lapped surface than that produced by the cast iron plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">For an optimal lapping result, many factors, such as process time, surface finish, and manufacturing cost, have to be considered, and many combinations of abrasive material, particle size, lapping rate, and wafer pressure can be employed in the practice of the present invention. In order to reduce the probability of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer cracking, a pressure below 5 psi, preferably 2 psi, is preferred. In order to reduce process time, a lapping rate above 50 μm/hr is preferred for stock removal. Among various kinds of abrasive materials, such as diamond, silicon carbide, boron carbide, and alumina, diamond slurry is preferred due to its high material removal rate and its production of better surface finishes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Lapping of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer blank can be achieved either by a single step, or by multiple steps, with each subsequent lapping step using abrasives of progressively smaller particle sizes. After each lapping step, an optical microscope can be used to examine the surface to make sure that surface damage from previous steps has been substantially removed, before proceeding to next step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In one illustrative embodiment of the invention, a single lapping slurry is used, comprising 9 μm diamond abrasive, for lapping an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer on a cast iron lapping plate under a pressure of 1 psi. The size of diamond abrasive particles is provided by the diamond slurry manufacturer, and is the average size of diamond particles in the slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">In another illustrative embodiment of the invention, two lapping slurries are used: the first lapping slurry comprises 9 μm diamond abrasive for lapping an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer on a cast iron lapping plate, and the second slurry comprises 6 μm diamond abrasive for lapping the same wafer on a copper plate to achieve the desired surface finish.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">After the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is lapped, it can be mechanically polished to achieve smooth surface morphology. During the mechanical polishing process, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is pressed against a polishing pad with abrasive particles. Polishing processes typically yield better surface finish than lapping, even with a same size diamond slurry. Polishing can be achieved either by a single step, or by multiple steps, with each subsequent polishing step using abrasives of progressively smaller particle sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">After the mechanical polishing process, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer surface becomes relatively smooth. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a Nomarski optical micrograph (×100) of a GaN surface after being mechanically polished with 1 μm diamond slurry until mirror finish has been achieved. However, such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is not suitable for homoepitaxial growth of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystals, since it still has significant surface and subsurface damage. The surface damage is characterized by dense polishing scratches that are visible under the atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">To remove such surface and subsurface damage and polishing scratches, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">A first CMP slurry effective for chemically mechanically polishing the Ga-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer comprises an acid and abrasive amorphous silica particles, such as fumed silica or colloidal silica, having particle sizes of less than 200 μm. The pH value of such CMP slurry may for example be in a range from about 0.5 to about 4. In some applications, it may be advantageous to employ a CMP slurry that includes an oxidization agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, dichloroisocyanuric acid or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a Nomarski optical micrograph and an AFM image, respectively, of a GaN wafer chemically mechanically polished using an acidic colloidal silica slurry having a pH value of 0.8 for about 1 hour. The GaN wafer was first polished with 1 μm diamond slurry before CMP. Besides a few defects from the substrate, the GaN surface is very smooth, with RMS surface roughness of about 0.15 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area and about 0.5 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area. Further, a previously unseen step structure is observed on the GaN surface under AFM. The presence of such step structure is an indication that the CMP process has been successful in removing polishing scratches from previous mechanical polishing. The CMP rate using such slurry can for example be on the order of about 2 μm/hr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">To further ascertain that the CMP process has also removed the subsurface damage on the surface, the wafer after CMP processing is etched with a strong etchant, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>at 180° C. for 5 minutes. At this etching condition, crystal defects as well as surface and subsurface damage on the Ga-side of GaN surface will be etched at a greater rate than good crystalline material, producing etching pits. The size and number of the pits can be studied with an atomic force microscope. After hot H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>etching, the CMP polished wafers show some etching pits, but the density of the etching pits is the same as the density of pits evident in the CMP polished surface. The size of the pits has increased, however. For comparison, a wafer that is not completely polished with the CMP process (i.e., using a shorter CMP processing time resulting in some residual polishing damage) shows more etching pits after etching with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>at 180° C. for 5 minutes, and many of the pits follow a line, indicating that the surface damage and subsurface damage are not completely removed when the CMP process is not complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Oxidation agents may optionally and advantageously be employed in the acidic CMP slurry, as necessary or desired in specific applications of such CMP methodology of the invention. When hydrogen peroxide or dichloroisocyanuric acid is used as an oxidation agent, the polishing rate is above 2 μm/hr, with RMS surface roughness being below 0.2 in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area and below 0.5 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area. The step structures on the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer surface are readily observed by AFM inspection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">A second CMP slurry effective for chemically mechanically polishing the Ga-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer comprises an acid and abrasive colloidal alumina particles having particle sizes of less than 200 nm. The pH value of such CMP slurry in one preferred embodiment is in a range from about 3 to about 4. Optionally, such CMP slurry can also comprise an oxidization agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, dichloroisocyanuric acid or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an AFM image of a GaN surface after being chemically mechanically polished with acidic colloidal alumina CMP slurry (pH=3.6) comprising hydrogen peroxide as an oxidization agent, for 1 hour. The step structure is observed under AFM, demonstrating that acidic colloidal alumina slurry is effective for removing mechanical damage from the GaN surface. However, at the same polishing operation conditions, the colloidal alumina-based slurry has a much lower polishing rate (about 0.1 μm/hr) than the polishing rate of the silica-based slurries. Because of such slow polishing rate, many polishing scratches are still present after 1 hour of polishing with the acidic colloidal alumina CMP slurry. A much longer polishing time is needed to completely remove the surface/subsurface damage with the colloidal alumina-based slurry than with the silica-based slurries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">A third CMP slurry effective for chemically mechanically polishing the Ga-side of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer comprises a base and amorphous silica particles, either fumed silica or colloidal silica, having particle sizes of less than 200 nm. The pH value of such illustrative CMP slurry is in a range of from about 8 to about 13.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show a Nomarski optical micrograph and an AFM image of a GaN wafer chemically mechanically polished using a basic colloidal silica slurry having a pH value of 11.2, for about 1 hour. The surface appears rougher and has significantly more scratches when polished, in comparison with the surface finish achieved with an acidic silica slurry. Moreover, the scratches are larger and deeper than those of the GaN surface after mechanical polishing with diamond slurry comprising 1 μm diamond powders, indicating that larger particles or particle agglomerations are present in the basic silica slurry. Interestingly, step structures are also observed. The presence of step structures indicates that surface damage from previous mechanical polishing has been removed, but the presence of larger particles in the slurry introduces new damage. It therefore is desirable to filter the basic silica slurry before polishing to remove large particles and to ensure that the abrasive particles in such slurry have particle sizes of less than 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Besides using hydroxides for pH alteration, the pH of the basic silica slurry can be adjusted with ammonia or alkanolamine. Ammonia- or alkanolamine-stabilized slurries provide smoother polished surfaces and therefore are preferred over hydroxide-based slurries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">To improve the stability of the CMP process, it may be advantageous to control the ambient humidity and temperature during the CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">After chemical mechanical polishing, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer can be cleaned and dried, using techniques known in the art. A mild etching can also be used to remove any remaining surface and subsurface damage from the final polished wafer. The condition for the mild etching is chosen to remove some residual surface damage on the Ga-side surface from final polishing, while not etching or etching to a limited degree the undamaged surface of the Ga-side. The mild etching can also remove the damage on the N-side surface to reduce the stress on the wafer caused by damage on the N-surface. This mild etching can also produce a matte finish on the N-surface. For example, the wafer can be slightly etched in an aqueous solution of base (for example, KOH or NaOH) or an aqueous solution of acid (for example, HF, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) at a temperature below 100° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers may suffer from internal stresses, which cause the wafer to bow or to warp. Thermal annealing or chemical etching of the AlxGayInzN wafer, which can be performed before, after or between the steps of the wafer fabrication sequence, can relax such internal stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">In the circumstance where the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer has large pits on its surface and contaminants are trapped in the pits from the fabrication process, it is beneficial to employ a chemical etching and cleaning step to remove the contaminants from the pits between the steps of wafer fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">In one embodiment of the present invention, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is subjected to thermal annealing at temperature up to 1000° C. in a nitrogen ambient. Preferably, the annealing temperature is in a range of from about 700° C. to about 1000° C., and the duration of the thermal annealing is in a range of from about 1 minute to about 1 hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">In another embodiment of the invention, the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer is subjected to chemical etching, which preferentially removes damaged surface material from the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer and reduces wafer bow and warp caused by surface damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">Chemical etching of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer can be accomplished by immersing the wafer in very strong acids or bases at an elevated temperature. Sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid at a temperature above 150° C. can be utilized to etch the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer. Alternatively, molten potassium or sodium hydroxide can also be employed to etch the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer. The etching conditions, such as etching temperature and etching time, are preferably controlled to yield removal of surface material of less than 100 μm thickness, and preferably less than 10 μm thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">After chemical mechanical polishing of a GaN surface, for example, using acidic silica CMP slurry (pH=0.8) for about 1 hr., small pits are formed, which may originate from dislocations in the crystal lattice of the GaN wafer. The diameter of the pits is typically below 1 μm, and more typically below 0.5 μm. The pits appear round without clear edges when imaged with an atomic force microscope. When the wafer has been completely CMP polished and is subjected to etching, for example, with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>at 180° C. for 5 minutes, the size of the pits is increased, but the density of the pits remain the same, i.e., no more pits are produced. Furthermore, the pits formed from etching the CMP polished wafer appear hexagonal when imaged with an atomic force microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an AFM image of a GaN surface, with clearly visible pits. The GaN surface was chemical mechanically polished using an acidic colloidal silica CMP slurry (pH=0.8) for about 1 hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also shows a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of a GaN wafer, polished by acidic colloidal silica CMP slurry (pH=0.8) for 1 hour, with visible pits that can be counted for determining the defect density of such GaN wafer. Without chemical mechanical polishing of the GaN wafer surface, such pits are not observed with AFM or with SEM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">In one aspect of the present invention, a CMP process is used to prepare an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer, to highlight crystal defects for subsequent determination of defect density by AFM or SEM techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">This defect highlight technique is superior to other techniques such as transmission electron microscope (TEM), wet-chemical etching, and photo electrochemical etching, which are generally conducted under harsh etching conditions, making the etched Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer unsuitable for subsequent epitaxial growth of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N crystalline material thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">By contrast, the use of a CMP process for highlighting crystal defects does not damage the crystal surface of the Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafer and therefore permits subsequent crystal growth.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">Such methodology may be employed for processing of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N wafers, e.g., in the fabrication of such wafers in a wafer fab, for planarization of such wafers, or for replanarization of such wafers, reworking of wafers to remove undesired layers or material therefrom, etc., as well as in fabricating laser facets on Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N for device applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">The method of the invention for chemically mechanically polishing Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N may also be employed for shaping of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles to counteract bow or other deformation or mis-shaping, such as otherwise may be manifested in the processing of such Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N articles.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">A GaN film several hundred microns thick was grown on a sapphire substrate by an HVPE process and then separated from the sapphire substrate. The resultantly formed freestanding GaN wafer blank exhibited a textured Ga-surface with a RMS roughness of about 4 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">The GaN wafer blank was then polished at the Ga-side with an acidic silica slurry without undergoing a lapping process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">After polishing, it was observed that the surface morphology of such GaN wafer was greatly improved, with the textured surface being entirely removed. The RMS roughness was reduced to below 0.3 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Thick GaN films with thickness in the range from 200-500 microns were grown on 2″ sapphire substrates by an HVPE process. The GaN films then were separated from the sapphire substrate, to yield freestanding GaN wafer blanks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">Flats for the GaN films were marked as 30° off the sapphire substrate's flat. The GaN wafer blanks then were sized into wafer shapes with diameter of 30, 35, and 40 mm using a particle beam jet. To prevent wafer breakage during wafer sizing, it was preferable to mount the GaN wafer on a glass plate of at least 1 mm thickness, using wax.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Nine GaN wafers were mounted on a lap fixture with wax with the N-side facing the lap fixture. A steel block was placed on top of each wafer while the wax cooled. The GaN wafers were first lapped on the Ga-side with diamond slurry of 9μm in diameter on a cast iron lapping plate. Before lapping, a large thickness variation existed between the wafers and within each wafer. After lapping, uniformity of wafer thickness was greatly improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">The wafers then were removed from the lapping fixture, and wax-mounted on a mechanical polishing fixture. Each wafer was polished with diamond slurry of 3 μm in diameter until mirror finish was achieved. Under optical microscope examination, all surface damage from the lapping process was removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">After mechanical polishing, the wafers were chemically mechanically polished with acidic colloidal silica slurry. A Nomarski optical microscope was used to examine the polished surfaces, to verify that the CMP process removed all mechanical polishing scratches.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Three GaN wafer blanks were mounted on a lap fixture with wax with the Ga-side facing the lap fixture. A steel block was placed on top of each wafer while the wax cooled. The GaN wafers were first lapped on the N-side with diamond slurry of 9 μm in diameter on a Lapmaster 15 lapping machine with cast iron lapping plate until a uniform mat finish was achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">After the N-side was lapped, the GaN wafers were removed from the lap fixture by heating on a hot plate. The wafers were cleaned and mounted on a lap fixture with wax with the N-side facing the lap fixture. A steel block was placed on top of each wafer while the wax cooled. The GaN wafers were lapped on the Ga-side with diamond slurry of 9 μm in diameter on a cast iron lapping plate until a desirable wafer thickness was obtained. Subsequently, the GaN wafers were lapped with diamond slurry of 6 μm in diameter on a copper lapping plate until surface features from the previous lapping step were removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">After lapping, the three wafers were mechanically polished with diamond slurry of 1 μm in diameter on a Buehler ECOMET polisher until the surface features from the previous lapping step were removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">After mechanical polishing, the three wafers were chemical mechanically polished with an acidic colloidal silica slurry on a Beuhler ECOMET polisher. The acidic colloidal silica slurry was prepared by mixing 2 parts of 1 molar aqueous hydrochloric acid with 1 part of commercial silica slurry, Nalco 2350 polishing slurry. A Nomarski optical microscope was used to examine the polished surfaces, to verify that the CMP process removed all mechanical polishing scratches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">After CMP process, the wafers were removed from the polish fixture and cleaned. The wafers were also cleaned in diluted hydrofluoric acid to remove any residual colloidal silica particles on the wafer surface. The wafers were imaged with atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments NanoScope III) to determine the density of the pits and the smoothness of the surface. For one wafer, the RMS roughness was 0.11 nm in a 2×2 μm<sup>2 </sup>area and 0.28 nm in a 10×10 μm<sup>2 </sup>area. The pit density for the three wafers was about 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7 </sup>pits/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the pit size was about less than 0.4 μm in diameter.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">A GaN boule was sliced vertically, to produce wafer samples with surfaces that were parallel to the c-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">The sliced samples were first lapped with 9 μm diamond slurry on a cast iron plate with a Lapmaster 15 lapping machine to remove the wire saw marks. Subsequently, the samples were polished with 3 μm diamond slurry on a Suba500 polishing pad to obtain a mirror finish. The surfaces still had scratches that were observed under an optical microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">The samples next were chemical mechanically polished with a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry consisting of a mixture of colloidal silica and hydrochloric acid, for 1 hour. Such CMP processing removed the surface scratches from the samples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an AFM image of a CMP-polished GaN sample (50×50μm) at a surface parallel to the c-axis of the GaN, after such processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The white spots on the sample surface were residual CMP slurry particles. The CMP polished surface was very smooth, and was determined to have a RMS roughness of 0.8 nm over the 50 μm×50 μm area. Furthermore, no polish scratches were observed, indicating that the CMP slurry was effective in removing the surface damage of this GaN sample on the surface parallel to the c-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">The GaN wafers of the present invention can be used to construct optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes and blue light lasers. Such devices are important, as the blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers are an enabling technology, allowing much higher storage density in magneto-optic memories and CDROMs and the construction of full color light emitting displays. Such devices can replace today's incandescent light bulbs in road and railway signals, etc., where they promise very substantial cost and energy savings.</div>
