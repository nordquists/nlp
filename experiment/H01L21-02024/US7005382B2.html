<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing and a chemical mechanical polishing process making use of this dispersion. Further, the present invention relates particularly to an aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing that has high shelf stability, prevents deterioration with time even in storage in a state of a high concentration, can provide a polished surface having excellent planarization and lessened surface defects by chemical mechanical polishing and is useful in production of semiconductor devices, a chemical mechanical polishing process excellent in polishing and removal selectivity making use of such a dispersion, and a production process of semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">With the increase of the degree of integration and the formation of multi-layer wiring in semiconductor devices, a technique of chemical mechanical polishing is adopted for polishing of a film to be processed. This technique serves to remove an excess wiring material and form a wiring by embedding a proper wiring material in grooves, holes or the like of a desired pattern formed in a dielectrics on a process wafer and then chemically and mechanically polishing the dielectrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Such a chemical mechanical polishing process is also applied to formation of capacitors, gate electrodes and the like in addition to the formation of wiring and utilized in specular polishing of a silicon wafer such as an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Objects to be polished by such a chemical mechanical polishing process include various films such as polysilicon films (polycrystalline silicon films), monocrystalline silicon films, silicon oxide films, aluminum films, tungsten films and copper films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In such a chemical mechanical polishing step, the object should be naturally achieved by conducting polishing only for a standard time of X/V (min) when an initial excess film of thickness X (Å), formed by embeding a wiring material in grooves or the like is polished at a removal rate of V (Å/min). In an actual production step of semiconductor devices, however, over polishing exceeding the standard time, X/V (min) is carried out for the purpose of removing the wiring material remaining on other portions than the grooves or the like. “Dishing” that a portion of wiring becomes a concave form or “erosion” that a portion of alternate wiring obtained by alternately forming a wiring portion and an insulating portion becomes a concave form is caused by such over polishing. These phenomena are not preferred in that yield of semiconductor devices is lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Further, surface defects including so-called “scratches” of abrased-like state, may be caused by polishing in some cases. This phenomenon may also lower yield of semiconductor devices like the dishing and erosion in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Various compositions such as aqueous dispersions for chemical mechanical polishing for restraining such dishing and erosion, aqueous dispersions for chemical mechanical polishing for restraining the surface defects such as scratches and aqueous dispersions for chemical mechanical polishing having both properties in combination have heretofore been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">For example, it is disclosed that excellent surface planarizing ability can be achieved by polishing a silicon wafer using a composition containing silica and piperazine (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 154760/1993). However, piperazine that is an essential component of this disclosed composition is an objective substance to regulate the amount of discharge to environment, and so the use thereof becomes a problem from the viewpoints of safety and influence on the environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In addition, compositions for polishing comprising at least one abrasive grain selected from silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, titanium oxide, silicon nitride, zirconium oxide and manganese dioxide and water, and additionally containing a basic organic compound in a state dissolved are disclosed. It is described that by these compositions for polishing, a great removal rate is achieved, and occurrence of surface defects on a polished surface can be lessened (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 321569/1998).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">With requirement of the increase of the degree of integration and the micronization in semiconductor devices, the micronization of a wiring pitch and the formation of a thinner dielectrics make progress. By the micronization of the wiring pitch, a silicon oxide film and a stopper layer composed of a nitride such as silicon nitride or titanium nitride are also made fine. When the stopper layer is over polished, however, the intended function of the stopper layer cannot be fulfilled, and erosion or the like are caused, so that the function as a semiconductor substrate may be impaired in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In addition, the surface defects including scratches on a polished surface have such influence that electrical properties of a dielectrics deposited thereon are deteriorated, and this influence becomes greater by the formation of a thinner dielectrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">When a surface to be polished having the above-described stopper layer is polished with such a composition for polishing as described above, it is not easy to achieve both improvement of polishing and removal selectivity as to the layer to be polished and the stopper layer, and lessening of surface defects including scratches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The term, “polishing and removal selectivity” as used herein means properties that a high rate of polishing and removal is achieved as to a material to be polished, while the rate of polishing and removal is low as to other materials, and means properties that when a surface to be polished composed of, for example, at least 2 material is polished, only one material to be polished can be polished with high efficiency without over polishing other materials to be polished. More specifically, the term, “polishing and removal selectivity as to a layer to be polished and a stopper layer” means properties that only the layer to be polished can be polished with high efficiency without over polishing the stopper layer when both layer to be polished and stopper layer are polished at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In order to solve the above-described problem, there have been proposed compositions improved in the polishing and removal selectivity as to a polysilicon film and a silicon oxide film and compositions controlled in removal rate (hereinafter also referred to as “polishing rate”) of polishing a nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 321569/1998 discloses that the polishing rate of a silicon oxide film can be controlled by the above-described composition for polishing to increase the polishing and removal selectivity as to a polysilicon film and the silicon oxide film. However, it is not investigated to control the polishing rate of a nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A composition for polishing comprising a tetramethylammonium salt, a base and hydrogen peroxide in combination is also disclosed. It is described that by this composition, the polishing rate of a nitride can be controlled to increase the polishing and removal selectivity as to both oxide and nitride (for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 270401/1998). However, this composition is excellent in the polishing and removal selectivity as to both oxide and nitride, but the polishing and removal selectivity as to polysilicon that becomes a material of a gate electrode and a nitride and the polishing and removal selectivity as to polysilicon and silicon oxide are not investigated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">With respect to the above-described composition for polishing, in particular, long-term stability in a high-concentration state that concentrations of respective components are higher than those in a polishing applicable state to be actually served for polishing is also not investigated, and the composition is assumed to be used within several hours after preparation of the composition. Therefore, this composition involves factors that cost is increased upon actual use, such as need of transporting and storing it in a state that the concentrations of the components has been controlled as low as those upon its use.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The present invention has been made on the basis of the foregoing circumstances and has as its first object the provision of an aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing, which is excellent in surface planarizing ability as dishing, erosion or the like is lessened in a plarnarizing step of a surface to be polished by chemical mechanical polishing, excellent in polishing and removal selectivity as to polysilicon and silicon oxide and polishing and removal selectivity as to polysilicon and a nitride, and excellent in long-term stability even in a high-concentration state, a chemical mechanical polishing process using this composition, and a production process of a semiconductor device.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The aqueous dispersions (hereinafter also referred to as “slurries” merely) for chemical mechanical polishing according to the present invention will hereinafter be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">According to the present invention, there are fundamentally provided the first slurry and the second slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0004">&lt;First Slurry&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The first slurry is obtained by mixing a water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt, an inorganic acid salt and abrasive grains into an aqueous medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The respective components making up the first slurry will hereinafter be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The first slurry can be stored over a long period of time in a high-concentration state as described below. However, the preferred mixing proportions (hereinafter also referred to as “specific mixing proportions”) of the respective components described below are all values in a polishing applicable state to be served for polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">[1] Water-Soluble Quaternary Ammonium Salt:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt is preferably a compound represented by the following formula (1):
<br/>
[NR<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[OH]<sup>−</sup>  (1)
<br/>
wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Incidentally, 4 R groups may be the same or different from one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Specific examples thereof include compounds such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetraisopropylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and tetraisobutylammonium hydroxide. Among these, tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetraethylammonium hydroxide are particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The above-mentioned water-soluble quaternary ammonium salts may be used either singly or in any combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The mixing proportion of the water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt is preferably 0.005 to 5% by mass, more preferably 0.008 to 4% by mass, particularly preferably 0.01 to 3% by mass based on the total mass of the first slurry. If the mixing proportion of the water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt is lower than 0.005% by mass, a sufficient polishing rate may not be achieved in some cases. It is not necessary to contain the water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt in a proportion exceeding 5% by mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Incidentally, the water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt is dissolved in the resulting aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing, and a part thereof is contained as an ion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">[2] Inorganic Acid Salt:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Examples of the inorganic acid salt include the sodium salts, potassium salts, ammonium salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, carbonic acid and phosphoric acid; and sodium salts, potassium salts and ammonium salts having a hydrogensulfate ion, hydrogencarbonate ion or hydrogenphosphate ion. Among these, ammonium salts are preferred, with ammonium carbonate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate being particularly preferred. These inorganic acid salts may be used either singly or in any combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The mixing proportion of the inorganic acid salt is preferably 0.005 to 5% by mass, more preferably 0.008 to 4% by mass, particularly preferably 0.01 to 3% by mass based on the total mass of the first slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">If the mixing proportion of the inorganic acid salt is lower than 0.005% by mass, the effect of controlling dishing and erosion, namely, the effect of lessening dishing and erosion may become insufficient in some cases. It is not necessary to contain the inorganic acid salt in a proportion exceeding 5% by mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">[3] Abrasive Grains:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The abrasive grains include inorganic particles, organic particles and composite particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">As examples of the inorganic particles, may be mentioned particles of silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon nitride, manganese dioxide and the like. Among these, particles of silicon dioxide are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As specific examples of the silicon oxide particles, may be mentioned fumed silica synthesized by a fumed process, in which silicon chloride or the like is reacted with oxygen and hydrogen in a vapor phase, colloidal silica synthesized by a sol-gel process, in which a metal alkoxide is hydrolyzed and condensed, and colloidal silica synthesized by an inorganic colloid process, in which impurities are removed by purification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The colloidal silica synthesized by the sol-gel process or colloid process is present in a state that primary particles have associated or aggregated in an aqueous medium, i.e., in a state of secondary particles, when the particle diameter thereof is relatively small. The inorganic particles in such a state preferably have an average particle diameter of 1 to 3,000 nm, more preferably 2 to 1,000 nm in terms of primary particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The average particle diameter of the secondary particles is preferably 5 to 5,000 nm, more preferably 5 to 3,000 nm, particularly preferably 10 to 1,000 nm. If inorganic particles, the average particle diameter of the secondary particles of which is smaller than 5 nm, are used, the resulting aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing cannot achieve a sufficiently high polishing rate in some cases. On the other hand, with a slurry using inorganic particles, the average particle diameter of the secondary particles of which exceeds 5,000 nm, the prevention of dishing and erosion may become insufficient in some cases, and further, surface defects such as scratches may be liable to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The average particle diameter of the primary particles can be calculated out from the measurement of the specific surface area of the intended particles and observation through a transmission type electron microscope, and the like. The average particle diameter of the secondary particles can be determined by measurement by means of a laser scattering diffraction measuring device, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">On the other hand, inorganic particles such as silica synthesized by the fumed process are produced in the form of secondary particles, and it is very difficult to disperse them in a state of primary particles in an aqueous medium, and so such particles are present as secondary particles obtained by aggregation of primary particles. Accordingly, the inorganic particles formed of silica synthesized by the fumed process are sufficiently identified so far as the secondary particles thereof are defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In the inorganic particles such as silica synthesized by the fumed process, the average particle diameter of the secondary particles thereof are preferably 10 to 10,000 nm, more preferably 20 to 7,000 nm, particularly preferably 50 to 5,000 nm. By using the inorganic particles composed of fumed silica, the average particle diameter of the secondary particles of which falls within this range, there can be provided a slurry which can achieve a high polishing rate, sufficiently prevents dishing and erosion and is high in stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">As examples of the organic particles, may be mentioned polymer particles respectively composed of (1) polystyrene and styrene copolymers, (2) (meth)acrylic polymer and (meth)acrylic copolymers such as polymethyl methacrylate, (3) polyvinyl chloride, polyacetal, saturated polyester, polyamide, polyimide, polycarbonate and phenoxy resins, and (4) polyolefins and olefin copolymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(1-butene) and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene), and besides other thermoplastic resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">These organic particles can be prepared by a method of grinding a resin obtained by an emulsion polymerization process, suspension polymerization process, emulsion dispersion polymerization process, bulk polymerization process or the like, or other methods. The organic particles may also be particles of a copolymer having a crosslinked structure obtained by causing a crosslinkable monomer such as divinylbenzene or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate to coexist in the above-described polymerization process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The organic particles are preferably particles of a resin selected from (1) polystyrene and styrene copolymers and (2) (meth)acrylic polymer and (meth)acrylic copolymers such as polymethyl methacrylate among the resin mentioned above, and their copolymers having a crosslinked structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In such organic particles as described above, almost all the particles thereof are generally present as simple particles in the slurry. The average particle diameter of these organic particles is preferably 10 to 5,000 nm, more preferably 15 to 3,000 nm, particularly preferably 20 to 1,000 nm. By using the organic particles having an average particle diameter within this range, there can be provided an aqueous dispersion for chemical mechanical polishing which can achieve a high polishing rate, sufficiently prevents dishing and erosion and is high in stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In the present invention, as specific examples of the composite particles, may be mentioned inorganic organic composite particles obtained by integrally combining organic particles with inorganic particles, and modified particles obtained by bonding a modifying substance to surfaces of organic particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The composite particles composed of the inorganic organic composite particles are those obtained by integrally combining organic particles with inorganic particles to the extent that these particles are not easily separated. No particular limitation is imposed on the kinds of these organic particles and inorganic particles. For example, the same organic particles and inorganic particles as mentioned above may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">No particular limitation is also imposed on the specific structure of the composite particles. For example, those obtained by combining the organic particles composed of polymer particles with the inorganic particles by a proper method are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">More specifically, particles in a state that organic particles and inorganic particles, polarity of zeta potential of which are different from each other, have been combined by electrostatic force in, for example, an aqueous medium may be used as the composite particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The zeta potential of the organic particles is often negative in the whole pH range or a wide pH range exclusive of a low pH range. In particular, organic particles composed of a polymer having a carboxyl group, sulfonic group or the like surely have a negative zeta potential, and organic particles composed of a polymer having an amino group or the like have a positive zeta potential in a specific pH range. On the other hand, the zeta potential of the inorganic particles have high dependency on pH, and some inorganic particles have an isoelectric point, at which a zeta potential is zero, at a characteristic pH. In such inorganic particles, the polarity of the zeta potential thereof is reversed above and below this point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">From the above-described fact, a specific kind of organic particles are combined with a specific kind of inorganic particles, and both particles are mixed in such a pH range that their zeta potentials become reverse polarities to each other, whereby inorganic organic composite particles in a state that such organic particles and inorganic particles have been integrally combined by electrostatic force can be obtained. Even when the zeta potentials of organic particles and inorganic particles mixed have the same polarity upon mixing, inorganic organic composite particles in a state that the organic particles and inorganic particles have been integrally combined can also be obtained by changing the pH after the mixing to create a state that the zeta potentials thereof become reverse polarities to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In the present invention, the composite particles may be modified organic particles of a state that a proper modifying substance has been bonded to the surfaces of organic particle composed of, for example, polymer particles. As examples of the polymer particles, may be mentioned particles of polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The polymer particles, to which the modifying substance has been bonded, can be obtained by, for example, a method in which a reactive material for modifying substance, such as an alkoxysilane, aluminum alkoxide or titanium alkoxide, is polycondensed in the presence of the polymer particles to form the modifying substance on the surfaces of the polymer particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">When the material for the modifying substance is an alkoxysilane, modified organic particles of a state that the polymer particles having polysiloxane on the surfaces thereof can be obtained. When the material for the modifying substance is an aluminum alkoxide or titanium alkoxide on the other hand, modified organic particles having atomic group containing an aluminum or titanium atom can be obtained. In the method described above, the surfaces of the polymer particles may also be treated with a silane coupling agent or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">In the present invention, the composite particles may also be inorganic organic composite particles combined by bonding inorganic particles such as silica particles or alumina particles to the surfaces of organic particles composed of proper polymer particles. In this case, the inorganic particles may be bonded in a form physically held to a bonding component such as polysiloxane on the surfaces of the polymer particles or be chemically bonded by a functional group such as a hydroxyl group existing on the surfaces of the polymer particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Those of a state that the inorganic organic composite particles integrally bonded by electrostatic force as described above have been modified by a modifying substance by a polycondensation reaction of, for example, an alkoxysilane, aluminum alkoxide, titanium alkoxide or the like in the presence of such inorganic organic composite particles can also be used as the composite particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">When the composite particles are composed of the inorganic organic composite particles, such composite particles exist in any of the following States (1) to (3) according to the particle diameters and component proportions of the respective organic particles and inorganic particles forming the composite particles or in a state where more than one of the states are present in combination.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0065">State (1): a state that the inorganic particles have adhered as shell particles to the surfaces of core particles composed of the organic particles.</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0066">State (2): a state that the organic particles have adhered as shell particles to the surfaces of core particles composed of the inorganic particles.</li> <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0067">State (3): a state that the organic particle and inorganic particles have aggregated to each other without forming a clear core-shell structure.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Among the above-described states, State (1) or (3) is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In each of States (1) to (3), the inorganic particles may be in any state of primary particles and secondary particles, or both particles may be mixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">With respect to the component proportions of the inorganic particles and organic particles forming the inorganic organic composite particles, the proportion of the inorganic particles is preferably 1 to 2,000 parts by mass, more preferably 10 to 1,000 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the organic particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In the present invention, the average particle diameter of the composite particles is preferably 20 to 20,000 nm, more preferably 50 to 10,000 nm, particularly preferably 50 to 5,000 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">By containing the composite particles satisfying the above-described conditions, there can be provided a slurry which can achieve a high polishing rate, sufficiently prevents dishing and erosion and is high in stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">The mixing proportion of the abrasive grains may be controlled to preferably 0.01 to 10% by mass, more preferably 0.03 to 8% by mass, particularly preferably 0.05 to 5% by mass based on the total mass of the first slurry. If the mixing proportion of the abrasive grains is lower than 0.01% by mass, the resulting slurry cannot achieve sufficient polishing rate. If the mixing proportion exceeds 10% by mass on the other hand, the resulting slurry becomes high cost and may be deteriorated in shelf stability in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">[4] Aqueous Medium:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The first slurry is obtained by mixing the water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt, inorganic acid salt and abrasive grains as described above, and components optionally contained into an aqueous medium to disperse them in the aqueous medium. As the aqueous medium, may be used water, a mixed medium comprising water and a water-soluble alcohol in an amount or proportion within a range not impairing the polishing performance, or the like. However, water is particularly preferred.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0019">[7] Chemical Mechanical Polishing of Surface to be Polished:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">The second chemical mechanical polishing process according to the present invention comprises the step of polishing a surface to be polished with the second slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">When chemical mechanical polishing of the surface to be polished is carried out with the second slurry, the polishing apparatus exemplified as the polishing apparatus usable in the first chemical mechanical polishing process using the first slurry can be used to conduct the polishing under the prescribed polishing conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">According to an embodiment of the second chemical mechanical polishing process of the present invention, for example, a groove portion is formed on a semiconductor substrate (also including a semiconductor wafer), a silicon type film such as a polysilicon film or amorphous silicon film is formed on the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate including this groove, the silicon type film is then subjected to a polishing treatment using such a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus as described above and the second slurry to remove other portions of the silicon type film than a portion buried in the groove portion, whereby a buried groove having excellent surface characteristics and composed of silicon such as the polysilicon film or amorphous silicon film can be formed in the groove portion formed on the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">According to another embodiment, a silicon oxide film is formed on a semiconductor substrate (also including a semiconductor wafer), and a groove portion is additionally formed on the resultant stacked film. After silicon such as polysilicon or amorphous silicon is further deposited on the groove portion formed on the stacked film, the deposited silicon type film is subjected to a polishing treatment using the silicon oxide film as a stopper layer, and a surface exposed by this polishing treatment is treated as a surface to be polished to conduct a polishing treatment using, for example, the above-described chemical mechanical polishing apparatus and the second slurry, whereby a buried groove having excellent surface characteristics and composed of silicon can be formed in the groove portion formed on the stacked film obtained by stacking the silicon oxide film on the semiconductor substrate because the second slurry has excellent polishing and removal selectivity as to the silicon type film and the silicon oxide film. In this embodiment, even when a polishing treatment is conducted in the same manner as in said embodiment except that a nitride film such as a titanium nitride film, tantalum nitride film or silicon nitride film is formed in place of the silicon oxide film, and this nitride film is used as a stopper layer, a buried groove having excellent surface characteristics and composed of the silicon such as the polysilicon film or amorphous silicon film can be formed in the groove portion formed on the stacked film obtained by stacking the nitride film on the semiconductor substrate because the second slurry has excellent polishing and removal selectivity as to the silicon type film and the nitride film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">According to a further embodiment, a monocrystalline silicon film can be polished in a specular state using the above-described chemical mechanical polishing apparatus and the second slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">According to a still further embodiment, a groove portion is formed on a semiconductor substrate, a wiring material film such as a pure metal film such as a pure tungsten film, pure aluminum film or pure copper film, or an alloy film composed of an alloy of tungsten, aluminum or copper with any other metal is formed on the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate including this groove, and a polishing treatment is then conducted using the above-described chemical mechanical polishing apparatus and the second slurry to remove other portions of the wiring material film than a portion buried in the groove portion, whereby a buried wiring having excellent surface characteristics can be formed in the groove portion formed on the semiconductor substrate. Incidentally, a stopper layer composed of a metal such as tantalum or titanium, an oxide such as a tantalum oxide or titanium oxide, a nitride such as titanium nitride or tantalum nitride or the like is generally formed on the surface of the groove formed on the semiconductor substrate, the wiring material film is formed on the surface of the stopper layer, and the polishing treatment is then conducted. In this case, a buried wiring having excellent surface characteristics can be formed because the second slurry has excellent polishing and removal selectivity as to the wiring material film and the stopper layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">The evaluation of the polishing and removal selectivity as to the silicon type film such as the polysilicon film or amorphous silicon film and the silicon oxide film, the polishing and removal selectivity as to the silicon type film and the nitride film and the polishing and removal selectivity as to the wiring material film and the stopper layer can be made by polishing the respective films to be polished under the same conditions to compare them, specifically, by determining a ratio of polishing rates between the films. The term, “the same conditions” means that a polishing apparatus of a specific model is used, and the rotating speeds of the platen and head thereof, polishing pressure, polishing time, the kind of a polishing pad used and a feed rate of the aqueous dispertion for chemical mechanical polishing per unit time are made the same. The “ratio of polishing rates” can be calculated out from the value of the respective polishing rates of (1) the silicon type film such as the polysilicon film or amorphous silicon film, (2) the silicon oxide film or nitride film that becomes a stopper layer, and (3) the wiring material film when these films are separately polished under the same conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">In the second chemical mechanical polishing process of the present invention, a first specific polishing rate ratio represented by a ratio of the polishing rate of a polysilicon film to the polishing rate of a silicon oxide film in the case where the silicon oxide film and polysilicon film are polished under the same conditions may be controlled to at least 30, preferably at least 100, particularly preferably at least 300. Alternatively, a second specific polishing rate ratio represented by a ratio of the polishing rate of a polysilicon film to the polishing rate of a nitride film in the case where the nitride film and polysilicon film are polished under the same conditions may be controlled to at least 50, preferably at least 100, particularly preferably at least 300.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">After completion of the polishing treatment, the abrasive grains remaining on the polished surface are preferably removed. The removal of the abrasive grains can be conducted by the removing method exemplified as the removing method usable after completion of the chemical mechanical polishing using the first slurry.</div>

[4] Evaluation of Polishing Performance on Polysilicon Film:
</div>
<heading>Example 1-1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0032">(i) Evaluation of Polishing Rate Upon Polishing of Polysilicon Film:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">Slurry [1A] (product diluted after 2 hours form the preparation) prepared in the step [3] was used, and an 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film was placed on a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus (Model “EPO112”, manufactured by Ebara Corporation) to polish a polysilicon film (film thickness: 5,000 Å) formed on the substrate by means of a polishing pad (product of Rodel Nitta, Ltd.; trade name “IC1000”) made of porous polyurethane under the following conditions. The polishing rate of the polysilicon film was found to be 4250 Å/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Carrier load: 300 g/cm<sup>2 </sup> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Carrier rotating speed: 50 rpm</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Feed rate of slurry: 200 ml/min</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Polishing time: 1 minute</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0033">[ii] Evaluation of Polishing and Removal Selectivity as to Polysilicon Film and Silicon Oxide Film:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The polishing rate of a silicon oxide film was determined in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that an 8-inch silicon oxide film substrate (film thickness: 5,000 Å) was used in place of the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i]. As a result, the polishing rate of silicon oxide film was 5 Å/min. From this fact, the polishing and removal selectivity as to the polysilicon film and the silicon oxide film of Slurry [1A] was able to be calculated as 850.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0034">[iii] Evaluation of Polishing and Removal Selectivity as to Polysilicon Film and Silicon Nitride Film:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">The polishing rate of a silicon nitride film was determined in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that an 8-inch silicon nitride film substrate (film thickness: 1,000 Å) was used in place of the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i]. As a result, the polishing rate was 5 Å/min. From this fact, the polishing and removal selectivity as to the polysilicon film and the silicon nitride film of Slurry [1A] was able to be calculated as 850.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">A polishing treatment was conducted in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that a wafer with polysilicon deposited (amount of polisilicon deposited: 3500 Å) on a silicon oxide film including a pattern of a wiring 50 μm wide/a non-wiring portion 9 μm wide and a pattern of a wiring 2 μm wide/a non-wiring portion 0.35 μm wide was used in place of the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i], and the polishing time was set so as to exceed by 30% as much as the standard time. After the polishing, erosion at an alternate wiring site having the wiring width of 50 μm and an alternate wiring site having the wiring width of 2 μm was measured by means of a step height and surface roughness meter (Model “P-10”, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Co.). As a result, erosion at the alternate wiring sites were 750 Å and 600 Å, respectively. When these values are not greater than 1000 Å and 700 Å, respectively, the erosion resistance may safely be said to be good.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">Incidentally, the polishing time exceeding by 30% as much as the standard time was calculated in the following manner based on the polishing rate of the polysilicon film measured in the evaluation [i] and performed.
<br/>
Polishing time (min)=[Amount of polysilicon deposited (Å)/Polishing rate (Å/min) of polysilicon film]×1.3

(v) Evaluation of Stability of High-Concentration Product of Slurry:
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">Evaluation as to the respective items was made in substantially the same manner as in the evaluation (i) to (iv) except that Slurry [1A] obtained by diluting High-Concentration Product [1Ad] after stored at 40° C. for 90 days after the preparation of High-Concentration Product [1Ad] was used in place of Slurry [1A] obtained by diluting High-Concentration Product [1Ad] after 2 hours from the preparation in the evaluation (i) to (iv). The results are shown in Table 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">As apparent from Table 5, it was understood that the performance of Slurry [1A] is almost the same between the case where Concentration Product [1Ad] was diluted to be used after 2 hours from the preparation and the case where Concentration Product [1Ad] was diluted to be used after stored at 40° C. for 90 days after the preparation, and thus has excellent long-term stability in a high-concentration state.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">An ion-exchanged water in an amount that the total mass of the resulting high-concentration product amounted to 100% by mass was added to a 1-liter polyethylene bottle, an aqueous solution of hydroxyethyl cellulose was added to the ion-exchanged water so as to give a concentration of 0.15% by mass in terms of the hydroxyethyl cellulose content, and the mixture was fully stirred. Thereafter, an aqueous solution of triethanolamine and an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide were added with stirring so as to give concentrations of 3% by mass and 0.1% by mass in terms of the triethanolamine content and tetramethylammonium hydroxide content, respectively, and colloidal silica (average primary particle diameter: 35 nm; average secondary particle diameter: 70 nm) was added so as to give a mixing amount of 2.5% by mass. After the resultant mixture was fully stirred, it was filtered through a filter having a pore size of 5 μm to obtain High-Concentration Product [2ad] of Aqueous Dispersion [2a] that is Second Aqueous Dispersion Material (II) making up the two-liquid mixed type slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">Respective High-Concentration Products [2bd] to [2dd] of Aqueous Dispersions [2b] to [2d] that are Second Aqueous Dispersion Materials (II) were obtained in substantially the same manner as described above except that the kinds and mixing amounts of the respective components were changed as shown in Table 7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">Hydroxyethyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose used in Aqueous Dispersion [2dd] were purified by respectively feeding aqueous solutions thereof to a resin column packed with a mixture of an H type ion-exchange resin and an OH type ion-exchange resin at a fixed rate from one direction to bring them into contact with the ion-exchange resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">An ion-exchanged water in an amount that the total mass of the resulting high-concentration product amounted to 100% by mass was added to a 1-liter polyethylene bottle, and the aqueous solutions shown in the row of “Additive 3” of Table 8 were respectively added to the ion-exchanged water so as to give the respective mixing amounts shown in the row of “Additive 3” of Table 8, and the resultant mixtures were fully stirred. Thereafter, the aqueous solutions shown in the row of “Additive 4” of Table 8 were respectively added with stirring so as to give the respective mixing amounts shown in the row of “Additive 4” of Table 8. At the same time, abrasive grains were added, the resultant mixtures were fully stirred, and they were respectively filtered through a filter having a pore size of 5 μm to obtain respective High-Concentration Products [2ed] and [2fd] of Aqueous Dispersions [2e] and [2f] that are Comparative Second Aqueous Dispersion Materials (II). Incidentally, the particle diameters of the abrasive grains shown in Tables 7 and 8 were described in order of average primary particle diameter and average secondary particle diameter as to the colloidal silica. As the particle diameter of the composite particles, was described an average particle diameter.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">Aqueous Dispersion [2A] (product diluted after 2 hours form the preparation) and Aqueous Dispersion [2a] (product diluted after 2 hours form the preparation) prepared in the step [3] were used to polish a polysilicon film (film thickness: 5,000 Å) on an 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film. Specifically, the silicon substrate was placed on a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus (Model “EPO112”, manufactured by Ebara Corporation) to polish the polysilicon film by means of a polishing pad (product of Rodel Nitta, Ltd.; trade name “IC1000”) made of porous polyurethane under the following conditions. The respective aqueous dispersions were fed to a platen through separate lines. The polishing rate of the polysilicon film was found to be 2500 Å/min.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0248">The polishing rate of a silicon oxide film was determined in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that an 8-inch silicon oxide film substrate (film thickness: 5,000 Å) was used in place of on the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i], and the polishing time was changed to 3 minutes. As a result, the polishing rate was 6 Å/min. From this fact, the polishing and removal selectivity as to the polysilicon film and the silicon oxide film of the two-liquid mixed type slurry composed of a mixture of Aqueous Dispersion [2A] and Aqueous Dispersion [2a] was able to be calculated as 415.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0055">[iii] Evaluation of Polishing and Removal Selectivity as to Polysilicon Film and Silicon Nitride Film:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0249">The polishing rate of a silicon nitride film was determined in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that an 8-inch silicon nitride film substrate (film thickness: 1,000 Å) was used in place of the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i], and the polishing time was changed to 3 minutes. As a result, the polishing rate was 5 Å/min. From this fact, the polishing and removal selectivity as to the polysilicon film and the silicon nitride film of the two-liquid mixed type slurry composed of a mixture of Aqueous Dispersion [2A] and Aqueous Dispersion [2a] was able to be calculated as 500.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0056">[iv] Evaluation of Erosion:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0250">A polishing treatment was conducted in the same manner as in the evaluation [i] except that a wafer with polysilicon deposited (amount of polisilicon deposited: 3500 Å) on a silicon oxide film including a pattern of a wiring 50 μm wide/a non-wiring portion 9 μm wide and a pattern of a wiring 2 μm wide/a non-wiring portion 0.35 μm wide was used in place of the 8-inch silicon substrate having a thermal oxidation film in the evaluation [i], and the polishing time was set so as to exceed by 30% as much as the standard time. After the polishing, erosion at an alternate wiring site having the wiring width of 50 μm and an alternate wiring site having the wiring width of 2 μm was measured by means of a step height and surface roughness meter (Model “P-10”, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Co.). As a result, erosion at the alternate wiring sites were 510 Å 440 Å, respectively. When these values are not greater than 600 Å and 500 Å, respectively, the erosion resistance may safely be said to be good.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">Incidentally, the polishing time exceeding by 30% as much as the standard time was calculated in the following manner based on the polishing rate of the polysilicon film measured in the evaluation [i] and performed.
<br/>
Polishing time (min)=[Amount of polysilicon deposited (Å)/Polishing rate (Å/min) of polysilicon film]×1.3
<br/>
(v) Evaluation of Scratches:
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">With respect to the polysilicon films after polished in the evaluation (i), the total number of scratches occurred on the whole surface of each of the polished surfaces was counted by means of a wafer defect inspection apparatus (Model “KLA2351”, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Co.). As a result, one scratch was counted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0057">(vi) Evaluation of Stability of High-Concentration Product of Aqueous Dispersion:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">Evaluation as to the respective items was made in substantially the same manner as in the evaluation (i) to (v) except that a two-liquid mixed type slurry obtained by diluting High-Concentration Products [2Ad] and [2ad] after stored at 40° C. for 90 days after the preparation was used in place of the two-liquid mixed type slurry obtained by diluting High-Concentration Products [2Ad] and [2ad] after 2 hours from the preparation in the evaluation (i) to (v). The results are shown in Table 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">As apparent from Table 11, it was understood that the performance of Aqueous Dispersion [2A] and Aqueous Dispersion [2a] is almost the same between the case where High-Concentration Products [2Ad] and [2ad] were diluted for use after 2 hours from the preparation and the case where High-Concentration Products [2Ad] and [2ad] were diluted for use after stored at 40° C. for 90 days after the preparation, and thus have excellent long-term stability in a high-concentration state.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">Evaluation was made in substantially the same manner as in Example 2-1 except that their corresponding first aqueous dispersion material (I) and second aqueous dispersion material (II) shown in Tables 11 and 12 were used in place of Aqueous Dispersions [2A] and [2a] in Example 2-1. The results are shown in Tables 11 and 12.</div>
