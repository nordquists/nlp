<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to the preparation of semiconductor substrate surfaces, and more specifically to preparing substrate surfaces using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP).</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a process that is used to polish surfaces of semiconductor wafers. In particular, CMP employs both physical and chemical forces to polish wafer surfaces. First, a load force is applied to the back of a wafer while it rests on a polishing pad. Both the pad and the wafer are then counter-rotated while slurry containing both abrasives and reactive chemicals is passed underneath.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">CMP is typically used to planarize a surface of a wafer for the purpose of creating an integrated circuit. CMP has emerged as the planarization method of choice because of its ability to planarize over longer lengths than traditional planarization techniques. As discussed, CMP is a combination of a chemical reaction and mechanical action. First, the slurry weakens the wafer surface and the slurry particles, in addition to particles located on the pad, complete material removal from the wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">It is desired to use aluminum nitride (AlN) as a substrate material for creating commercial semiconductor devices, however, there are problems in processing AlN surfaces to derive substrate surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. For example, current CMP processes damage the AlN material making it unsuitable for epitaxial growth. It would be beneficial to have an improved method for polishing AlN wafers that produces a quality surface suitable for epitaxial growth.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The use of single crystal III-nitrides allow improved epitaxial growth, improved thermal and chemical compatibility, as well as improved thermal conductivity. Applications of wide-bandgap and high-temperature semiconductors including the development of blue/UV solid-state charge injection lasers, UV optical sources and detectors, high power microwave devices, high power switches, and high temperature applications. However, there is a need to obtain a method for suitably preparing surfaces of aluminum nitride (AlN) substrates for epitaxial growth to produce these devices. For example, nitrides (e.g. AlN, Al<sub>x</sub>, Ga<sub>(1−x)</sub>N, etc.) may be epitaxially grown on single crystal AlN substrates by, for example, Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (OMVPE) and other formation processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Device fabrication on AlN substrates generally involves the epitaxial growth of a device layer. The quality of this device layer depends on the quality of the surface of the AlN substrate. Despite the best polishing techniques, the wafer surface can retain polishing defects such as micro-damage and surface roughness. Surface defects are known to effect the quality of finished semiconductors prepared through epitaxial growth. It is believed that conventional polishing procedures damage the AlN surface both at a submicron scale and just under the AlN surface in such a way that the substrate is unsuitable for epitaxial growth. Difficulty arises in preparing such surfaces because the AlN surface is unable to be polished using conventional CMP process without introducing surface defects. Because conventional CMP techniques damage the AlN surface, a method that produces an atomically smooth surface suitable for epitaxial growth for AlN crystals is desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">According to one aspect of the invention, an improved process for preparing a surface of a substrate is provided wherein the surface of the substrate is prepared for a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, the CMP process is performed on the surface of the substrate, and the surface of the substrate is finished to clear the substrate surface of any active ingredients from the CMP process. Also, an improved substrate produced by the method is provided. According to one aspect of the invention, particular polishing materials and procedures may be used that allow for increased quality of AlN substrate surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">To employ AlN crystals as substrates for epitaxial growth of other compound semiconductors such as GaN, InN, or 2H—SiC, large area, high perfection AlN wafers are needed. After growing AlN boules, the boules are generally cut into wafers using annular diamond saws or wire saws and then the surface of each is ground and polished flat. According to one embodiment of the invention, AlN crystal surfaces (e.g., the a, +c or −c surfaces of AlN) are polished using CMP to derive surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Optimally, these polished surfaces are flat, highly perfect surfaces with a minimum of scratches, pits, or damage dislocations and other subsurface damage. Also, these polished surfaces are also free of aluminum oxide coating or islands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In any grinding process, the powder employed for grinding should have a microhardness greater than or equal to that of the crystal being ground. The basic goal is to remove material from the crystal in a short period of time. The polishing is intended to give a mirror-like finish to the surface, and leave a damage-free crystal underneath. This polishing process is much like “chemical-mechanical-planarization” processes as are known in the art which are used most frequently to planarize wafer surfaces of multilayer devices. In this process, the polishing lubricant actually reacts slowly with the crystal being polished. The slurry and abrasive pad are designed to continuously remove the reaction products without appreciably damaging the underlying crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In CMP, high elevation features of a wafer are selectively removed (i.e., material from high elevation features is removed more rapidly than material at lower elevations), resulting in a surface having an improved planarity. Mechanical polishing, assisted by chemical action, produces such selective material removal. The process is performed by mounting the wafer face down on a carrier. The carrier is then pressed against the rotating platen containing a polishing pad. The carrier itself is also rotated. An abrasive-containing aqueous slurry is dripped onto the table, saturating the pad. Conventionally, the slurry comprises abrasives of silica, alumina, ceria, or other nanometer-size particles suspended in an alkaline or acidic medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">According to one aspect of the invention, it is realized that orientation affects mechanical preparation of a substrate surface prior to CMP processing. So-called c-face substrates are produced when the AlN crystal is sliced perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal. These c-face substrates are polar and the surfaces on the two sides of the substrate will have quite different properties. One side of the substrate is aluminum (Al) terminated (or so-called Al-polarity, c-face) and the other side is nitrogen (N) terminated (or so-called N-polarity, c-face).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">When the AlN crystal is cut so that the c-axis of the crystal is contained in the plane of the substrate, a non-polar substrate is produced wherein the two surfaces have identical behavior. Substrates that are cut at some angle away from the c-axis (other than 90°) also demonstrate some polarity effects, but these effects are not as strong as the effects of c-face substrates. C-face substrates are currently being used to produce electronic devices that take advantage of polar effects to create a high-density electron gas without any or with minimal doping. However, optoelectronic devices are expected to be better if non-polar substrates are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that substantial differences exist for optimal preparation of the substrates surfaces with different crystallographic orientations. In the case of an AlN substrate, it is realized that the Al-terminated, c-face is not reactive with water, but the N-terminated c-face is reactive with water, along with non-polar faces. During wet lapping and polishing, the Al-polarity face tends to chip under the same conditions that are well-suited to mechanically polish the non Al-polarity faces and for Al-polarity faces where the c-axis is oriented 20 degrees or more away from the surface normal of the substrate. (Effectively, wet mechanical processing used on orientations other than the on-axis c-face is actually a chemical mechanical processing with a fixed abrasive). According to one embodiment of the invention, dry grinding and polymer diamond suspensions are used to prepare the Al-polarity side of c-face substrates that are close to on-axis (misorientation less than approximately 20°). Even under strictly mechanical polishing, the removal rates observed for the on-axis, Al-polarity surface is lower than for all other crystal orientations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that the amount of material that should be removed during the mechanical processing prior to fine mechanical polishing and CMP depends upon quality of the saw cut. Typically between 50 and 100 μm must be removed to level the irregular cut of the saw for an annular saw. At this point, the sample is generally planar and should have a low pit density, and the sample may be subjected to fine mechanical processing. In this step, it is realized, according to one embodiment, that planarity of the samples be brought to the highest level for c-face, Al-polarity substrate surfaces, because it is realized that any exposed off-axis material will lead to undercutting of the desired surface during CMP. For non-polar surfaces, the high chemical reactivity allows planarization during CMP (few microscopically viewable pits and scratches are allowable and does not cause the CMP undercutting effects on the Al-polarity surfaces. Fine mechanical processing generally involves a measured removal totally between 10 and 20 μm of sample thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that the removal rate during CMP is very much a function of the crystallographic orientation of the substrate surface. For the Al-polarity, c-face substrates, the removal rate increases from around 1 μm per hour to over 10 μm per hour as the angle between the surface normal and the c-axis is increased from near zero to over 20°. For the non-polar and N-polarity, c-face surfaces, the removal rate is mechanically limited by the abrasive particles in the slurry.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional CMP apparatus that may be used to polish substrate surfaces in a CMP process according to one embodiment of the invention. A wafer <b>101</b> to be polished is mounted on a wafer carrier <b>102</b> which generally includes a backing film <b>109</b> positioned between wafer <b>101</b> and a chuck <b>108</b> which holds the wafer and the wafer carrier <b>102</b>. Wafer carrier <b>102</b> is rotated by a spindle <b>105</b>. A force is applied to the wafer carrier <b>102</b> to contact the wafer <b>101</b> with one or more polishing pads <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>B. The one or more polishing pads <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>B are adhered to a platen <b>106</b> which also rotates. Further, a slurry <b>107</b> is applied to the pad <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>B and the drip rate is controlled, for example, by a control flow dispenser (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">It should be appreciated that other CMP tools and/or polishing apparatus may be used and the invention is not limited to any particular CMP tools or polishing configurations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">According to one aspect of the invention, the CMP process may involve polishing the substrate using a slurry, the slurry comprising an abrasive suspension in a solution such that the slurry is capable of etching the substrate surface and creating a finished surface suitable for epitaxial growth. For example, a silica suspension in a solution may be used. This solution may be, for example, a hydroxide (basic) solution. Such a slurry is available commercially, for example, as the KOH-based CMP slurry known in the art as SS-25 (Semi-Sperse 25), available from Cabot Microelectronics or the Syton slurry available from Monsanto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that a higher pH KOH slurry works better for the Al-polarity, c-face surface. The SS25 slurry has a pH of 11.0. Its high pH distinguishes it from other commercially availably KOH slurries (like Syton and Glanzox) which have lower pH. For the on-axis Al-polarity, c-face surface, it is realized, according to one embodiment of the invention, that the pH should be over 10.5 to obtain observable removal rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">It should be appreciated that other slurry types may be used. For example, diamond, silicon carbide, or other material may be used in a slurry. Also, other commercially-available slurries are available (e.g., SS-25-E and SS-225 (ammonia hydroxid-based) both of which are available from Cabot Microelectronics, AM 100 and Rodel 2371 (ammonia-based slurries)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Such chemical/mechanical polishing methods are particularly suitable for preparing very hard surfaces, such as aluminum nitride (AlN) surfaces. It should be appreciated that various aspects of the invention reduce an amount of impurities and surface defects introduced into the AlN crystal substrate by the polishing procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a process <b>200</b> for polishing a substrate according to one embodiment of the invention. At block <b>201</b>, process <b>200</b> begins. At block <b>202</b>, the substrate is prepared for polishing. This may include removal of contamination from the surface of the substrate, the polishing apparatus and environment. Such contamination is generally responsible for the introduction of surface defects during the polishing process. At block <b>203</b>, a CMP process is performed on the substrate surface. In the case of AlN, the CMP process may include polishing the surface using a slurry having a hydroxide solution. For example, the SS-25 slurry available from Cabot Microelectronics may be used. It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the type of slurry, and that other appropriate slurries may be used as discussed above. At block <b>204</b>, the polished sample is finished. This may involve, for example, removal of the sample from the polishing apparatus and carefully cleaning the sample to remove any reactive agents introduced by the polishing process. At block <b>205</b>, process <b>200</b> ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a more detailed process <b>300</b> for polishing a substrate according to one embodiment of the invention. At block <b>301</b>, process <b>300</b> begins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">According to one embodiment of the invention, the AlN substrate is prepared for a CMP process. More particularly, the environment and wafer are cleaned of possible contaminants, and the polishing apparatus adjusted to apply the correct polishing force to the wafer. The following example is a procedure for preparing the substrate according to one embodiment of the invention:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">I. Preparation of Substrate and Apparatus for CMP Process</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">1. The sample surface and mounting block should be cleaned of substantially all possible contamination particles (e.g., wax, dirty, and larger mechanical grit particles). This is typically done with, for example, organic solvent (e.g., by acetone and/or methanol) cleaning performed at block <b>302</b>. Also, any remaining particles from previous processings (e.g., CMP fluid residue) should be cleaned from all surfaces that contact the polishing area so as to reduce the likelihood of contaminating the polishing surface and potentially damaging the substrate surface.
<br/>
2. The mounting block is then prepared to hold the sample at block <b>303</b>. For example, the sample may be adhered to a surface of the mounting block. The mounting block is then switched from the “mechanical” process fixture to the “CMP” process fixture. According to one embodiment of the invention, these fixtures may be identical items; their use may be segregated to avoid cross contamination between the mechanical and chemical mechanical polishing.
<br/>
3. The mounted sample may have the vertical offset corrected to allow the sample appropriate contact with the polishing surface. A mass to ensure proper down force can be added to the block at <b>304</b>. Pressure in a range of 5×10<sup>5 </sup>to 7×10<sup>5 </sup>N/m<sup>2 </sup>have been shown to be suitable. These are conditions that have yielded the most consistent results for both non-polar and polar faces. However, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to any particular set of conditions.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">According to one embodiment of the invention, a CMP process may be performed on the prepared substrate surface. In one aspect of the invention, SS-25 (Semi-Sperse 25) slurry available from the Cabot Microelectronics Corporation may be used to polish an AlN substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">II. CMP Process</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The following is a detailed sequence of steps, according to one embodiment of the invention, to prepare an AlN substrate surface and the drip rates for a CMP process according to one embodiment of the invention.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0048">A new “Multitex 1000” fine polishing pad or any other suitable fine polishing pad should be applied to the polishing table (platen). Generally, such a polishing pad has a self-adhesive backing to adhere it to the platen surface. At block <b>305</b>, the polishing pad is adhered to the platen surface. For best results, the polishing pad should be applied to the polishing deck in such a way to ensure that the pad is not placed with space behind the pad causing it to be uneven. For example, the polishing pad may be rolled onto the table from the lead edge to the other side with a cleaned rod so that spaces behind the pad can be avoided.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0049">At block <b>306</b>, the pad surface may be cleaned. For example, the pad may be cleaned with distilled water, saturated with water and the empty pad and platen surface rotated (e.g., 45-60 RPM or 13 to 18 m/sec in the sample path) on the pad for 10 to 15 minutes. During this cleaning process, the sample (with the substrate to be polished) should be lifted out of contact with the polishing surface. During this time, the surface of the pad should be thoroughly rinsed with filtered distilled water. This is performed to ensure that both the pad and the fixture have been completely cleaned of all dust and cross-contaminated particles.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0050">At block <b>307</b>, the slurry drip rate and rotation of the fixture should be set for polishing. During this rotation cleaning of the surface, the drip rate should be set using an appropriate flow control dispenser. The rate that has yielded the best and most consistent polishing results has been 3 drops of SS-25 slurry and distilled water per minute (approximately 0.5 mL/minute of each of the CMP fluid and distilled water for a circular 8.0″ diameter polishing surface). It should be appreciated, however, that the invention is not limited to any particular drip rate, and that drip rate depends on the type of slurry used, pressure applied to the sample, and rotation speed. With this average drip rate set, the SS-25 slurry should be allowed to drip onto the polishing surface allowing the lapping fixture to evenly spread the solution and fill the sample area with a consistent level of abrasive particles and reactive solution prior to polishing the substrate surface. The polishing pad may be preconditioned in this manner prior to polishing for approximately 30-60 minutes or any other appropriate time to allow for substantially even distribution of slurry and etchant over the surface of the pad.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0051">Following the proper rate confirmation and with the observation of proper rotation of the fixture, then the sample may be lowered on the surface to begin the CMP process. At block, <b>308</b>, the sample is polished.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Although a typical process time (polishing time) for this step is approximately 1 hour, a process time in a range of 5 minutes to 100 hours has been shown to adequately polish a surface. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to a particular process time, but rather, the process time range is provided by way of example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Although the material removal depends highly upon the crystal quality and the orientation of the sample, common values range from 0.1 μm (Al face c-axis) to 60 μm (N face c-axis) for 1 hour processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">According to one embodiment of the invention, the sample is cleaned to remove any contamination from the CMP process, and to remove traces of reacting chemicals from the substrate surface to stop any residual reactions with the substrate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">
</div> <ul>
<li id="ul0003-0001" num="0055">1. At block <b>309</b>, the sample is rinsed. At the end of the CMP process, the sample should be lifted from the polishing surface and immediately rinsed, for example, with distilled water. This is performed to ensure that the reaction between the AlN and any of the active ingredients in the slurry be stopped, and to remove abrasives that may dry to the prepared surface.</li>
<li id="ul0003-0002" num="0056">2. Following this rinsing, the sample is carefully cleaned at block <b>310</b> with suitable organic solvents to remove the agent bonding the substrate to the substrate holder. Mounting waxes soluble in these solvents and other common sample holding techniques may be used to hold the substrates, as well as other adhesive film and vacuum chucking techniques. Each of these holding techniques may need different substrate debonding procedures at block <b>311</b>, as is well-known in the art.</li>
<li id="ul0003-0003" num="0057">3. Following the CMP processing, the sample surface should be cleaned very well at block <b>312</b>. For example, the sample surface may be cleaned prior to removal of the sample from the mounting block, and then the entire sample may be cleaned when removed.</li>
