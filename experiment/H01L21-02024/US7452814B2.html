<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/JP2005/024057, filed on Dec. 28, 2005, which in turn claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 2005-005497, filed on Jan. 12, 2005, the disclosures of which Applications are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a method of polishing a GaN substrate.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">For example, the method described in Patent Document 1 is known as a polishing method of a magnetic head slider. A lapping oil composition for final polishing, for example, described in Patent Document 2 is known as a polishing solution for polishing the magnetic head slider.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Incidentally, the method described in Non-patent Document 1, for example, is known as a polishing method of a GaN substrate (gallium nitride substrate) instead of the magnetic head slider. This method is to polish the GaN substrate, using a diamond paste of the grain size of 0.1 μm and a pad of a suede type, and thereafter to chemically polish the GaN substrate, using a mixed solution of KOH and NaOH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Another known polishing method of the GaN substrate is, for example, the method described in Patent Document 3. This method is to polish the GaN substrate by free abrasive grains supplied onto a platen. Specifically, while gradually decreasing the grain sizes of free abrasive grains, the GaN substrate is polished at decreasing polishing speeds.

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, when the GaN substrate is polished using the free abrasive grains, the free abrasive grains flocculate together to coarsen on the platen and the coarsened particles scratch the GaN substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a polishing method of a GaN substrate capable of suppressing occurrence of the scratch.</div>
<heading>Means for Achieving the Object</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In order to achieve the above object, a polishing method of a GaN substrate according to the present invention is a method of polishing a GaN substrate, comprising: a first polishing step of polishing the GaN substrate, using a first platen and a polishing solution, while supplying the polishing solution containing first abrasives and a first lubricant, onto the first platen; and a second polishing step of polishing the GaN substrate, using a second platen in which second abrasives are buried, while supplying a second lubricant onto the second platen in which the second abrasives are buried, after the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Here the second platen may be the first platen, or another platen different from the first platen. The second abrasives may be the first abrasives, or other abrasives different from the first abrasives. For example, the “second platen in which the second abrasives are buried” may be the first platen in which the first abrasives are buried, or the first platen in which other abrasives different from the first abrasives are buried, or another platen different from the first platen, in which other abrasives different from the first abrasives are buried.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the polishing method of the GaN substrate of the present invention, the second abrasives are buried in the second platen in the second polishing step. For this reason, the second abrasives are prevented from flocculating together. Therefore, the second polishing step is able to polish the GaN substrate while suppressing the occurrence of scratch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Preferably, a peripheral speed of the first platen and a peripheral speed of the second platen are not less than 7 m/min nor more than 57 m/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">In this case, the polishing speed of the GaN substrate can be larger in the first and second polishing steps than in the case where the peripheral speed is less than 7 m/min. In addition, it becomes easier to stabilize rotation of the first platen and rotation of the second platen than in the case where the peripheral speed is larger than 57 m/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Preferably, the first abrasives are diamond grains. This can increase the polishing efficiency of the GaN substrate in the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Preferably, a constituent material of the first platen and a constituent material of the second platen are an alloy containing tin <b>50</b> or more % by mass. Since the alloy containing tin <b>50</b> or more % by mass is soft, a protruding amount of the first abrasives in the first platen and a protruding amount of the second abrasives in the second platen both become smaller. For this reason, it is feasible to keep small both surface roughness of the GaN substrate after the first polishing step and surface roughness of the GaN substrate after the second polishing step. It is also feasible to suppress the occurrence of scratch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Preferably, the polishing method of the GaN substrate further comprises a facing step of cutting the second platen so as to achieve flatness of not more than 10 μm, before the second polishing step; and a charging step of burying third abrasives for forming the second abrasives, into the second platen, after the facing step and before the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Here the “flatness” means a difference between a maximum and a minimum among thicknesses of an object to be measured. The facing step and the charging step may be carried out before the first polishing step, or may be carried out after the first polishing step and before the second polishing step. In another possible arrangement, the facing step is carried out before the first polishing step, and the charging step is carried out after the first polishing step and before the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">When the second platen is another platen different from the first platen, the “second platen in which the second abrasives are buried” is obtained, for example, by burying the third abrasives in the platen. When the first platen is also used as the second platen and when the charging step is carried out after the first polishing step, the “second platen in which the second abrasives are buried” is obtained, for example, by burying the third abrasives in the first platen. When the first platen is also used as the second platen and when the charging step is carried out before the first polishing step, the “second platen in which the second abrasives are buried” is obtained, for example, by first burying the third abrasives in the first platen and thereafter carrying out the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In this case, since the facing step is carried out, the flatness of the GaN substrate after the second polishing step is improved. Since the charging step is carried out, in-plane variation can be reduced in the protruding amount of the second abrasives. For this reason, in-plane variation is reduced in the polishing speed and surface roughness of the GaN substrate in the second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Preferably, the first lubricant and the second lubricant consist primarily of ethylene glycol and water. In this case, it becomes easier to clean the GaN substrate, the first platen, and others after the first polishing step and to clean the GaN substrate, the first and second platens, and others after the second polishing step. Since the first lubricant and the second lubricant contain ethylene glycol, the first lubricant is prevented from evaporating in the first polishing step, and it is feasible to achieve anticorrosion of the first platen. In addition, the second lubricant is prevented from evaporating in the second polishing step, and it is also feasible to achieve anticorrosion of the second platen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Preferably, the second polishing step uses the first platen as the second platen. In this case, there is no need for consideration to the individual difference between the first platen and the second platen, and thus the surface shape of the GaN substrate fits the surface shape of the second platen on the occasion of polishing the GaN substrate on the second platen after polished on the first platen. For this reason, it is feasible to suppress the occurrence of scratch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In the case where the first platen is used as the second platen in the second polishing step, the polishing method of the GaN substrate preferably further comprises a cleaning step of cleaning foreign matter on the first platen, after the first polishing step and before the second polishing step. This decreases the occurrence of scratch and the surface roughness due to the foreign matter on the first platen, in the second polishing step.</div>
<heading>Effect of the Invention</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">(Polishing Apparatus of GaN Substrate)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic perspective view showing an example of polishing apparatus suitably applied to the polishing method of the GaN substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention. The polishing apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a platen <b>101</b> placed on a table <b>113</b>, and a polishing jig <b>10</b> mounted on a surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the platen <b>101</b>. In the polishing apparatus <b>100</b>, a GaN substrate is placed between the platen <b>101</b> and the polishing jig <b>10</b>, and the GaN substrate is polished with rotation of the platen <b>101</b> and polishing jig <b>10</b>. The GaN substrate is suitably used, for example, for devices such as LEDs and LDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The platen <b>101</b> is, for example, a disk having a center point O and a radius r. The platen <b>101</b> rotates, for example, counterclockwise at a peripheral speed v. A chiller <b>111</b> for chilling the platen <b>101</b> is connected to the platen <b>101</b>. By using the chiller <b>111</b>, the temperature of the platen <b>101</b> can be controlled to a temperature (e.g., 20° C.) equivalent to room temperature. In this case, the platen <b>101</b> is prevented from generating heat or from being deformed during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">A motor <b>103</b> for rotating and swinging the polishing jig <b>10</b> is connected to the polishing jig <b>10</b>. The motor <b>103</b> is located on the table <b>113</b>. The polishing jig <b>10</b> is preferably arranged to rotate in the same direction as the rotating direction of the platen <b>101</b>, e.g., counterclockwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The following devices are placed on the table <b>113</b>: a facing mechanism <b>119</b> for cutting the surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the platen <b>101</b>; a dropping device (dispenser) <b>105</b> for dropping a polishing solution <b>27</b> onto the surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the platen <b>101</b>; a dropping device (dispenser) <b>107</b> for dropping a lubricant <b>31</b> onto the surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the platen <b>101</b>. Each of the dropping devices <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> has a drop nozzle <b>105</b> <i>a, </i> <b>107</b> <i>a, </i>respectively. These drop nozzles <b>105</b> <i>a, </i> <b>107</b> <i>a </i>deliver drops of the polishing solution <b>27</b> or lubricant <b>31</b>. The polishing solution <b>27</b> is, for example, like a slurry.

For example, grooves <b>15</b> <i>b </i>are radially formed in a lower surface <b>15</b> <i>a </i>of the drive ring <b>15</b>. The polishing jig <b>10</b> is so arranged that a surface <b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the GaN substrate <b>1</b> is in contact with the surface <b>101</b> <i>a </i>of the platen <b>101</b> (cf <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>

It is noted that the GaN substrate <b>1</b> is not limited to the stripe core substrate. The “stripe core substrate” herein refers to a substrate in a surface of which low-crystal-defect regions extending linearly and having a predetermined width and high-crystal-defect regions extending linearly and having a predetermined width are alternately arranged. The details of the stripe core substrate are described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-335646.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In the polishing method of the GaN substrate according to the present embodiment, as described above, the abrasives <b>29</b> are buried in the platen <b>101</b> in the second polishing step. For this reason, the abrasives <b>29</b> are prevented from flocculating together. In the second polishing step the protruding amount t<sub>w2 </sub>of the abrasives <b>29</b> is small and uniform. Therefore, the second polishing step is able to polish the GaN substrate <b>1</b> while suppressing the occurrence of scratch. Furthermore, it is also feasible to made the surface roughness Ra of the GaN substrate <b>1</b> small after the second polishing step and to reduce the in-plane variation of surface roughness Ra. On the other hand, the polishing speed of the GaN substrate <b>1</b> can be set large in the first polishing step and, therefore, it is feasible to efficiently eliminate a mechanically damaged layer which is formed in the GaN substrate <b>1</b> by preprocessing such as slicing or cutting before the first polishing step. The GaN substrate in which the occurrence of scratch is suppressed well can be suitably produced by the polishing method of the GaN substrate according to the present embodiment.</div>

In addition, it becomes easier to stabilize the rotation of the platen <b>101</b> and polishing jig <b>10</b> in the case of the peripheral speed v of not more than 57 m/min. Specifically, it is feasible to suppress fluctuation in the thrust direction (the axial direction of support rod <b>11</b> of polishing jig <b>10</b>) which could cause scratches. For this reason, the number of scratches can be reduced when compared with the case where the peripheral speed v is larger than 57 m/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In the first and second polishing steps, the rotating speed of the platen <b>101</b> is preferably not less than 5 rpm nor more than 40 rpm. The polishing speed of the GaN substrate <b>1</b> can be made larger in the case of the rotating speed of not less than 5 rpm than in the case of the rotating speed of less than 5 rpm; therefore, productivity is higher. Since it becomes easier to stabilize the rotation of the platen <b>101</b> in the case of the rotating speed of not more than 40 rpm, the number of scratches can be reduced when compared with the case where the rotating speed is larger than 40 rpm.</div>
