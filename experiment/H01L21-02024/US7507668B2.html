<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a polishing slurry for chemically mechanically polishing a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal used in a substrate for a semiconductor device such as a light emitting element, an electronic element and a semiconductor sensor, a method of treating a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal using the polishing slurry, and a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal substrate obtained by the surface treating method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal (0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1) such as a GaAs crystal and an InP crystal is very useful as a material for forming a substrate of a semiconductor device such as a light emitting element, an electronic element and a semiconductor sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal substrate (0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1) used as a substrate for a semiconductor device is obtained by subjecting an external circumference of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal to shape forming processing, slicing the crystal to have a predetermined thickness, and grinding or lapping a surface thereof and, by such the slicing and, grinding or lapping, a procession denatured layer (this refers to a layer in which crystal lattices are disturbed, which is formed on a surface side region of a crystal by processing a crystal surface; the same hereinafter) is formed on a surface side region of the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal, and a roughness of a surface of the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal becomes great.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">As a thickness of the procession denatured layer of this Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal substrate becomes greater, or as a surface roughness thereof becomes greater, quality of a substrate surface is deteriorated, irregularities of a surface of a Group III-V compound crystal layer which is epitaxial-grown on this Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal become great, and crystallizability of the surface is deteriorated. For this reason, a semiconductor device of better quality cannot be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">For this reason, as a method of forming a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal substrate from a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal, the following method is widely performed: a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal is sliced to have a predetermined thickness, a surface thereof is ground or lapped and, further, the surface is polished chemically and mechanically, thereby, a procession denatured layer of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal is removed, and a surface roughness is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">As a polishing slurry for chemically mechanically polishing a surface of the Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal, a polishing slurry containing spherical colloidal silica abrasive grains, an inorganic salt, and alkali metal chlorinated isocyanurate which is an oxidizing agent (e.g. see Japanese Patent Publication No. 3077665 (hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 1)), and a polishing slurry containing spherical colloidal silica abrasive grains, a mineral acid and persulfate which is an oxidizing agent (e.g. see Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 64-087147 (hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 2)) are proposed. In chemical mechanical polishing (hereinafter, referred to as CMP) using these polishing slurries, a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal is oxidized with an oxidizing agent and a mineral acid to form an oxidized layer, and this oxidized layer is removed with colloidal silica abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, in polishing slurries shown in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2, since spherical colloidal silica abrasive grains are used as abrasive grains, a rate of polishing a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal is low due to a low rate of removing the oxidized layer, and an efficiency of CMP is low. When a colloidal silica abrasive grain having a large particle diameter is used, a polishing rate can be enhanced, but a surface roughness is increased. In addition, also when an abrasive grain having a higher hardness than that of a colloidal silica abrasive grain, such as an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>abrasive grain is used, a polishing rate can be enhanced, but since a new procession denatured layer is formed due to this abrasive grain having a high hardness, better surface quality can not be obtained.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading>Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">One embodiment of a polishing slurry of the present invention is a polishing slurry for chemically mechanically polishing a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal (0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1), characterized in that this polishing slurry contains abrasive grains formed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, this abrasive grain is a secondary particle in which primary particles are associated, and a ratio d2/d<sub>1 </sub>of an average particle diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of a secondary particle to an average particle diameter d<sub>1 </sub>of a primary particle is not less than 1.6 and not more than 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Herein, chemical mechanical polishing refers to smoothing chemically and mechanically a surface of a subject to be abraded, using a polishing slurry. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b> can be chemically mechanically polished by pressing Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b> against a polishing pad <b>18</b> while polishing pad <b>18</b> fixed on a platen <b>15</b> is rotated around a rotation axis <b>15</b> <i>c, </i>and while a polishing slurry <b>17</b> is supplied on polishing pad <b>18</b> from a polishing slurry supply port <b>19</b>, and a weight <b>14</b> is placed on a crystal holder <b>11</b> to which Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b> is fixed, and this is rotated around a rotation axis <b>11</b> <i>c </i>of crystal holder <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Polishing slurry <b>17</b> of the present embodiment, by containing abrasive grains <b>16</b> formed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, can remove a procession denatured layer <b>1</b> <i>a </i>of Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b> to reduce a surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In addition, since abrasive grain <b>16</b> is a secondary particle in which primary particles are associated, a polishing rate is increased, and it becomes possible to effectively treat a surface of Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b>. By association of primary particles to become a secondary particle, an abrasive grain having an edgeless irregular shape on its surface is formed, and a polishing rate can be enhanced without generating a scratch. When an abrasive grain having a surface on which an edge is present is used, a scratch is generated upon polishing, and it becomes difficult to reduce a surface roughness. In addition, from a viewpoint of formation of an edgeless irregular shape, it is preferable that a primary particle is spherical or a shape of a spheroid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Herein, from a viewpoint that a primary particle is spherical or a shape of a spheroid, and a secondary particle having an edgeless irregular shape on its surface is easily formed, it is preferable that an abrasive grain is formed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>such as fumed silica and colloidal silica, particularly, colloidal silica. As a method of synthesizing colloidal silica, there are a synthesis method using a water glass (sodium silicate etc.) as a raw material, and a synthesis method using alkoxysilane as a raw material (sol-gel method). The former is low cost, and easily produces colloidal silica in a large amount, and the latter affords an abrasive grain having a high purity. By regulating the synthesis condition, a particle diameter of a primary particle, an association degree of a primary particle, and a particle diameter of a secondary particle can be freely controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In addition, an association degree of abrasive grain <b>16</b> is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of easy formation of an edgeless irregular shape on its surface, a ratio (d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>1 </sub>ratio) of an average particle diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of a secondary particle to an average particle diameter d<sub>1 </sub>of a primary particle is not less than 1.6 and not more than 10. Further, a d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>1 </sub>ratio is preferably not less than 2.0 and not more than 8. Herein, an average particle diameter d<sub>1 </sub>of a primary particle of abrasive grain <b>16</b> is calculated by the following equation (4):
<br/>
<i>d</i> <sub>1</sub>=6/(ρ×<i>S</i>)  (4)
<br/>
from measurement of an adhesion specific surface area (referred to as BET specific surface area; the same hereinafter) by a gas adsorption method. In the equation (4), ρ represents a density of a particle, and S represents a BET specific surface area. In addition, an average particle diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of a secondary particle of an abrasive grain is calculated by the following equation (5):
<br/>
<i>d</i> <sub>2</sub>=(<i>k×T</i>)/(3×π×η<sub>0</sub> <i>×D</i>)  (5)
<br/>
from measurement of a diffusion coefficient in Brownian movement of a particle by a dynamic light scattering method. In the equation (5), k represents a Boltzmann constant, T represents an absolute temperature, π represents a ratio of a circumference of a circle to its diameter, η<sub>0 </sub>represents a viscosity of a solvent, and D represents a diffusion coefficient.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">An average particle diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of a secondary particle of abrasion grain <b>16</b> is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of enhancement of a polishing rate, the diameter is preferably 30 nm or more and, from a viewpoint of reduction in a surface roughness, the diameter is preferably 300 nm or less. From such the viewpoint, an average particle diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of a secondary particle of abrasive grain <b>16</b> is more preferably 60 nm or more, and preferably 250 nm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In addition, a shape of abrasive grain <b>16</b> is not particularly limited. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the shape is, however, from a viewpoint that the particle forms an edgeless irregular shape, at least any shape of a cocoon shape shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a mass shape shown in (B<b>1</b>) and (B<b>2</b>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, and a chain shape shown in (C<b>1</b>) and (C<b>2</b>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is preferable. Further, from a viewpoint of enhancement of a polishing rate, it is more preferable that a shape of abrasive grain <b>16</b> is a mass shape or a chain shape rather than a cocoon shape. Since the polishing slurry of the present embodiment contains abrasive grains having the aforementioned edgeless irregular shape on their surface, mechanical polishing effect is increased, and it becomes possible to enhance a polishing rate without increasing a thickness of procession denatured layer <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. Herein, a shape of abrasive grain <b>16</b> can be observed with SEM (scanning electron microscope) and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Polishing slurry <b>17</b> of the present embodiment is specifically such that abrasive grains <b>16</b> (preferably, colloidal silica abrasive grains) formed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>are dispersed in water which is a dispersing medium. The abrasive grain content in polishing slurry <b>17</b> is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of enhancement of a polishing rate, the content is preferably 2 mass % or more and, from a viewpoint of reduction in a surface roughness and enhancement of surface quality, the content is preferably 40 mass % or less. From such the point of view, the abrasive grain content in polishing slurry <b>17</b> is more preferably 5 mass % or more, and more preferably 20 mass % or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In addition, it is preferable that a value X of a pH and a value Y (mV) of oxidation-reduction potential (referred to as ORP; the same hereinafter) of the polishing slurry of the present embodiment satisfy both relationships of the following equation (1) and equation (2):
<br/>
<i>Y≧−</i>50<i>X+</i>1000  (1)
<br/>
<i>Y≦−</i>50<i>X+</i>1900  (2)
<br/>
Herein, ORP means an energy level (potential) determined by the equilibrium state between an oxidized entity and a reduced entity which are present together in a solution. ORP obtained by measurement is a value relative to a reference electrode and, when a kind of a reference electrode is different, a measured value of the same solution is apparently different. In general academic articles, as a reference electrode, a normal hydrogen electrode (N.H.E) is used in many cases. ORP in the present application is expressed as a value using a normal hydrogen electrode (N.H.E) as a reference electrode.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">When a value X of a pH and a value Y (mV) of ORP of polishing slurry <b>17</b> of the present embodiment are: Y&gt;−50X+1000, an oxidizing power of polishing slurry <b>17</b> is weak, and a rate of polishing a surface of Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal <b>1</b> is lowered. On the other hand, when Y&gt;−50X+1900,an oxidizing power of polishing slurry <b>17</b> becomes too strong, the corroding action on polishing facilities such as a polishing pad and a platen becomes too strong, and stable CMP becomes difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In addition, from a viewpoint of more enhancement of a polishing rate, further, Y≧−50X+1300 is preferable. That is, it is preferable that a value X of a pH and a value Y (mV) of ORP of polishing slurry <b>17</b> satisfy both relationships of the following equation (2) and equation (3):
<br/>
<i>Y≦−</i>50<i>X+</i>1900  (2)
<br/>
<i>Y≧−</i>50<i>X+</i>1300  (3)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">An acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and a base such as KOH and NaOH which are contained in a conventional polishing slurry are weak in a force of oxidizing a surface of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal. For this reason, it is preferable that an oxidizing agent is added to the polishing slurry of the present embodiment to enhance ORP, that is, enhance an oxidizing power. An amount of an oxidizing agent to be added is adjusted so that a value X of a pH and a value Y (mV) of ORP of polishing slurry <b>17</b> satisfy both relationships of Y≧−50X+1000 (equation (1)) and Y≦−50X1900 (equation (2)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Herein, an oxidizing agent to be added to a polishing slurry is not particularly limited, but from a viewpoint of enhancement of a polishing rate, chlorinated isocyanuric acid such as trichloroisocyanuric acid, chlorinated isocyanurate such as sodium dichloroisocyanurate, permanganate such as sodium permanganate, dichromate such as potassium dichromate, bromate such as potassium bromate, thiosulfate such as sodium thiosulfate, persulfate such as ammonium persulfate and potassium persulfate, hypochlorous acid, nitric acid, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and the like are preferably used. These oxidizing agents may be used alone, or two or more may be used together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In addition, it is preferable that a pH of polishing slurry <b>17</b> of the present embodiment is not more than 5 or not less than 8. By contacting an acidic polishing slurry having a pH of 5 or less or a basic polishing slurry having a pH of 8 or more with a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal to oxidize procession denatured layer <b>1</b> <i>a </i>of a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal, a polishing rate can be enhanced. From a viewpoint of further enhancement of a polishing rate, a pH of polishing slurry <b>17</b> is more preferably not more than 4 or not less than 9, further preferably not more than 3 or not less than 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Herein, an acid, a base and a salt which are used for adjusting a pH are not particularly limited, but an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and carbonic acid, an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, phthalic acid and fumaric acid, a base such as KOH, NaOH, NH<sub>4</sub>OH and amine, and salts containing these acids or bases can be used. Alternatively, the aforementioned oxidizing agent may be added to adjust a pH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In particular, in a polishing slurry using the aforementioned organic acid and/or a salt thereof for adjusting a pH, a rate of polishing a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1−y </sub>crystal is enhanced as compared with a polishing slurry using the aforementioned inorganic acid and/or a salt thereof to realize the same pH. From a viewpoint of enhancement of a polishing rate, it is preferable that the organic acid and a salt thereof are carboxylic acid containing 2 or more carboxyl groups in one molecule and a salt thereof, respectively. Herein, preferable examples of dicarboxylic acid include malic acid, succinic acid, phthalic acid and tartaric acid. Preferable examples of tricarboxylic acid include citric acid. Therefore, it is preferable that a polishing slurry contains the abrasive grains, the oxidizing agent, the organic acid and/or a salt thereof.</div>

In addition, a surface roughness Ra refers to a value obtained by extracting only a 10 μm square as a standard area from a rough curved surface in its average plane direction, summing an absolute value of a deviation from an average plane of this extracted part to a measurement curved surface and averaging it by a standard area.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">As shown in Comparative Examples 4 to 6, when polishing is performed using a polishing slurry containing unassociated spherical colloidal silica abrasive grains, as a particle diameter of the abrasive grain grows larger, a polishing rate is enhanced, but both of surface roughnesses Ry and Ra are increased, and surface quality of an InP crystal substrate is deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">To the contrary, as shown in Examples 8 to 11, by performing CMP using a polishing slurry containing colloidal silica abrasive grains in which primary particles (average particle diameter d<sub>1</sub>) are associated to be a secondary particle (average particle diameter d<sub>2</sub>), a d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>1 </sub>ratio is not less than 1.6 and not more than 10, and d<sub>2 </sub>is not less than 30 nm and not more than 300 nm, and in which a value X of a pH and a value Y (mV) of ORP satisfy a relationship of −50X+1000≦Y≦−50X+1900, and a pH is 5 or lower, under the condition of a polishing pressure of 29.4 kPa (300 gf/cm<sup>2</sup>), and a rotation number of a polishing part and an InP crystal of 50/min, an rip crystal substrate having a surface having small surface roughnesses Ry and Ra was obtained at a high polishing rate.</div>
