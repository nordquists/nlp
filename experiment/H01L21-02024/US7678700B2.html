<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This invention pertains to a method of polishing a silicon carbide substrate.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Semiconductors with the ability to operate more efficiently in order to achieve a significant reduction in power consumption are highly desirable. Typically, silicon substrates are used in the manufacture of such devices, however, further development is limited due to the inherent characteristics of silicon. Development of the next generation of semiconductor devices has emphasized the use of materials having a greater hardness and other unique properties. For example, silicon carbide, when compared with silicon oxide, has a higher thermal conductivity, a greater tolerance for radiation, a higher dielectric strength, and is able to withstand greater temperatures, which makes it suitable for a variety of applications. The use of silicon carbide has been limited, however, by semiconductor fabrication technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In order to produce silicon carbide semiconductors, the surfaces of the silicon carbide substrates must be polished in order to provide smooth surfaces and to obtain precise dimensions for the surfaces. The properties which make silicon carbide such a useful substrate provide unique challenges in the polishing process. Due to the hardness of silicon carbide, diamond grit is typically used to mechanically polish silicon carbide substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques are widely used throughout the semiconductor industry in order to polish the current generation of silicon devices. CMP involves the use of a polishing composition (also known as a polishing slurry) containing an abrasive and an aqueous material, which is applied to a surface by contacting the surface with a polishing pad saturated with the polishing composition. The polishing composition may also contain an oxidizing agent, which allows for less aggressive mechanical abrasion of the substrate, thus reducing mechanical damage to the substrate caused by the abrading process. The use of such techniques to polish silicon carbide substrates could greatly reduce the costs of manufacturing semiconductors by decreasing polish time and reducing damage to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Adaptation of CMP techniques for silicon carbide polishing has been relatively unsuccessful. Polishing compositions containing colloidal silica resulted in low silicon carbide removal rates, thus requiring a lengthy polishing cycle lasting several hours at temperatures of around 50Â° C., which is likely to result in damage to the silicon carbide substrate. Zhou, et al., <i>J. Electrochemical Soc., </i>144, p. L161-L163 (1997); Neslen, et al., <i>J. Electronic Materials, </i>30, p. 1271-1275 (2001). The long polishing cycle adds considerable cost to the process and is a barrier preventing widespread use of silicon carbide within the semiconductor industry. Thus, there remains a need for alternative polishing systems and methods of polishing substrates comprising silicon carbide.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The invention provides a method of chemically-mechanically polishing a substrate comprising silicon carbide. The method comprises (i) contacting a substrate comprising at least one layer of single crystal silicon carbide, (ii) moving the polishing composition relative to the substrate, and (iii) abrading at least a portion of the silicon carbide of the substrate to polish the substrate. The polishing composition comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of (a) a liquid carrier, (b) an abrasive suspended in the liquid carrier, and (c) an oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In a first embodiment, the abrasive is substantially spherical silica particles having an average particle size of about 40 nm to about 130 nm, and the oxidizing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, oxone, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, iodates, persulfates, and mixtures thereof. In a second embodiment, the abrasive is alumina and is present in an amount of about 3 wt. % or less based on the weight of the liquid carrier and any components dissolved or suspended therein, and the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % based on the weight of the liquid carrier and any components dissolved or suspended therein, and is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, oxone, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, iodates, persulfates, and mixtures thereof. In a third embodiment, the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % based on the weight of the liquid carrier and any components dissolved or suspended therein, and is selected from the group consisting of oxone, potassium persulfate, and mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The substrate to be polished using the method of the invention can be any suitable substrate which comprises at least one layer of silicon carbide. Suitable substrates include, but are not limited to, flat panel displays, integrated circuits, memory or rigid disks, metals, interlayer dielectric (ILD) devices, semiconductors, micro-electro-mechanical systems, ferroelectrics, and magnetic heads. The silicon carbide can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any suitable silicon carbide, many of which are known in the art. The silicon carbide can be single crystal or polycrystalline. Silicon carbide has many different types of crystal structures, each having its own distinct set of electronic properties. Only a small number of these polytypes, however, can be reproduced in a form acceptable for use as semiconductors. Such polytypes can be either cubic (e.g., 3C silicon carbide) or non-cubic (e.g., 4H silicon carbide, 6H silicon carbide). The properties of these polytypes are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The polishing pad can be any suitable polishing pad, many of which are known in the art. Suitable polishing pads include, for example, woven and non-woven polishing pads. Moreover, suitable polishing pads can comprise any suitable polymer of varying density, hardness, thickness, compressibility, ability to rebound upon compression, and compression modulus. Suitable polymers include, for example, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylfluoride, nylon, fluorocarbon, polycarbonate, polyester, polyacrylate, polyether, polyethylene, polyamide, polyurethane, polystyrene, polypropylene, coformed products thereof, and mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The polishing pad can comprise fixed abrasive particles on or within the polishing surface of the polishing pad, or the polishing pad can be substantially free of fixed abrasive particles. Fixed abrasive polishing pads include pads having abrasive particles affixed to the polishing surface of the polishing pad by way of an adhesive, binder, ceramer, resin, or the like or abrasives that have been impregnated within a polishing pad so as to form an integral part of the polishing pad, such as, for example, a fibrous batt impregnated with an abrasive-containing polyurethane dispersion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The polishing pad can have any suitable configuration. For example, the polishing pad can be circular and, when in use, typically will have a rotational motion about an axis perpendicular to the plane defined by the surface of the pad. The polishing pad can be cylindrical, the surface of which acts as the polishing surface, and, when in use, typically will have a rotational motion about the central axis of the cylinder. The polishing pad can be in the form of an endless belt, which, when in use, typically will have a linear motion with respect to the cutting edge being polished. The polishing pad can have any suitable shape and, when in use, have a reciprocating or orbital motion along a plane or a semicircle. Many other variations will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The polishing composition comprises an abrasive, which desirably is suspended in the liquid carrier (e.g., water). The abrasive typically is in particulate form. In particular, the abrasive comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of substantially spherical silica or alumina. Substantially spherical silica is also referred to as colloidal silica by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, the substantially spherical silica is precipitated or condensation-polymerized silica, which is prepared using the sol-gel process. Condensation-polymerized silica particles typically are prepared by condensing Si(OH)<sub>4 </sub>to form substantially spherical particles. The precursor Si(OH)<sub>4 </sub>can be obtained, for example, by hydrolysis of high purity alkoxysilanes, or by acidification of aqueous silicate solutions. Such abrasive particles can be prepared in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 5,230,833 or can be obtained as any of various commercially available products such as Bindzil from EKA Chemicals, the Fuso PL-1, PL-2, and PL-3 products, and the Nalco 1034A, 1050, 2327, and 2329 products, as well as other similar products available from DuPont, Bayer, Applied Research, Nissan Chemical, and Clariant. Preferably, the alumina is seeded gel process alpha alumina, which is available from manufactures such as Saint Gobain (alpha alumina). The substantially spherical silica particles and the alumina particles can have any suitable particle size. For example, the substantially spherical silica particles and the alumina particles can have an average particle size of about 10 nm or more (e.g., about 20 nm or more, about 30 nm or more, about 40 nm or more, or about 50 nm or more). The substantially spherical silica particles and the alumina particles can have an average particle size of about 200 nm or less (e.g., about 180 nm or less, about 170 nm or less, about 160 nm or less, about 150 nm or less, about 130 nm or less, about 110 nm or less, or about 100 nm or less). Accordingly, the substantially spherical silica particles and the alumina particles can have an average particle size of about 40 nm to about 130 nm (e.g., about 45 nm to about 125 nm, about 50 nm to about 120 nm, about 55 nm to about 115 nm, or about 60 nm to about 110 nm). The particle size of a particle is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encompasses the particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Any suitable amount of abrasive can be present in the polishing composition. Typically, about 0.01 wt. % or more (e.g., about 0.05 wt. % or more) abrasive will be present in the polishing composition. More typically, about 0.1 wt. % or more (e.g., about 1 wt. % or more, about 5 wt. % or more, about 7 wt. % or more, about 10 wt. % or more, or about 12 wt. % or more) abrasive will be present in the polishing composition. The amount of abrasive in the polishing composition typically will be about 50 wt. % or less, more typically will be about 40 wt. % or less (e.g., about 15 wt. % or less, about 10 wt. % or less, about 5 wt. % or less, about 3 wt. % or less, about 1 wt. % or less, about 0.6 wt. % or less, or about 0.3 wt. % or less). Accordingly, the amount of abrasive in the polishing composition can be about 2 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, and more preferably about 5 wt. % to about 40 wt. % (e.g., about 10 wt. % to about 35 wt. %, about 15 wt. % to about 35 wt. %, or about 20 wt. % to about 35 wt. %).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">A liquid carrier is used to facilitate the application of the abrasive and any optional additives to the surface of a suitable substrate to be polished (e.g., planarized). The liquid carrier can be any suitable liquid, e.g., solvent, including lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc.), ethers (e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.), water, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the liquid carrier comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of water, more preferably deionized water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The polishing composition comprises an oxidizing agent, which can be any suitable oxidizing agent for one or more materials of the substrate to be polished with the polishing composition. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, oxone, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, iodates, persulfates, and mixtures thereof. The periodates, iodates, and persulfates can be any periodate, iodate, persulfate or combination of periodates, iodates, and persulfates, such as, for example, potassium periodate, potassium iodate, ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, or sodium persulfate. More preferably, the oxidizing agent is oxone or potassium persulfate. The oxidizing agent can be present in the polishing composition in any suitable amount. Typically, the polishing composition comprises about 0.001 wt. % or more (e.g., about 0.005 wt. % or more, about 0.01 wt. % or more, about 0.05 wt. % or more, or about 0.1 wt. % or more) oxidizing agent. The polishing composition preferably comprises about 20 wt. % or less (e.g., about 15 wt. % or less, about 10 wt. % or less, about 5 wt. % or less, about 2 wt. % or less, or about 0.5 wt. % or less) oxidizing agent. Preferably, the polishing composition comprises about 0.001 wt. % to about 20 wt. % (e.g., about 0.001 wt. % to about 15 wt. %, about 0.005 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, about 0.01 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, or about 0.05 wt. % to about 2 wt. %) oxidizing agent. More preferably, the polishing composition comprises about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. %, about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, or about 0.001 wt. % to about 2 wt. % oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The polishing composition, specifically the liquid carrier with any components dissolved or suspended therein, can have any suitable pH. The actual pH of the polishing composition will depend, in part, on the type of substrate being polished. The polishing composition can have a pH of about 11 or less (e.g., about 9 or less, about 7 or less, about 5 or less, about 4 or less, about 3 or less, or about 2 or less). The polishing composition can have a pH of about 1 or more (e.g., about 4 or more, about 6 or more, about 8 or more, or about 9 or more). The pH can be, for example, from about 1 to about 11 (e.g., from about 2 to about 10, from about 3 to about 9, from about 4 to about 8, or from about 5 to about 7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The pH of the polishing composition can be achieved and/or maintained by any suitable means. More specifically, the polishing composition can further comprise a pH adjustor, a pH buffering agent, or a combination thereof. The pH adjustor can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any suitable pH-adjusting compound. For example, the pH adjustor can be any suitable acid, such as an inorganic or an organic acid, or combination thereof. For example, the acid can be nitric acid. The pH buffering agent can be any suitable buffering agent, for example, phosphates, acetates, borates, sulfonates, carboxylates, ammonium salts, and the like. The polishing composition can comprise any suitable amount of a pH adjustor and/or a pH buffering agent, provided such amount is sufficient to achieve and/or maintain the desired pH of the polishing composition, e.g., within the ranges set forth herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The polishing composition optionally comprises a chelating or complexing agent. The complexing agent is any suitable chemical additive that enhances the removal rate of the substrate layer being removed, or that removes trace metal contaminants in silicon polishing. Suitable chelating or complexing agents can include, for example, carbonyl compounds (e.g., acetylacetonates and the like), simple carboxylates (e.g., acetates, aryl carboxylates, and the like), carboxylates containing one or more hydroxyl groups (e.g., glycolates, lactates, gluconates, gallic acid and salts thereof, and the like), di-, tri-, and poly-carboxylates (e.g., oxalates, oxalic acid, phthalates, citrates, succinates, tartrates, malates, edetates (e.g., dipotassium EDTA), mixtures thereof, and the like), carboxylates containing one or more sulfonic and/or phosphonic groups, and the like. Suitable chelating or complexing agents also can include, for example, di-, tri-, or polyalcohols (e.g., ethylene glycol, pyrocatechol, pyrogallol, tannic acid, and the like), polyphosphonates such as Dequest 2010, Dequest 2060, or Dequest 2000 (available from Solutia Corp.), and amine-containing compounds (e.g., ammonia, amino acids, amino alcohols, di-, tri-, and polyamines, and the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">It will be appreciated that many of the aforementioned compounds can exist in the form of a salt (e.g., a metal salt, an ammonium salt, or the like), an acid, or as a partial salt. For example, citrates include citric acid, as well as mono-, di-, and tri-salts thereof; phthalates include phthalic acid, as well as mono-salts (e.g., potassium hydrogen phthalate) and di-salts thereof; perchlorates include the corresponding acid (i.e., perchloric acid), as well as salts thereof. Furthermore, certain compounds or reagents may perform more than one function. For example, some compounds can function both as a chelating agent and an oxidizing agent (e.g., such as iron (II) nitrate, iron (III) nitrate, and the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The polishing composition optionally further comprises one or more other additives. Such additives include acrylates comprising one or more acrylic subunits (e.g., vinyl acrylates and styrene acrylates), and polymers, copolymers, and oligomers thereof, and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The polishing composition can comprise a surfactant and/or rheological control agent, including viscosity enhancing agents and coagulants (e.g., polymeric rheological control agents, such as, for example, urethane polymers). Suitable surfactants can include, for example, cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, mixtures thereof, and the like. Preferably, the polishing composition comprises a nonionic surfactant. An example of a suitable nonionic surfactant is an ethylenediamine polyoxyethylene surfactant. The amount of surfactant in the polishing composition typically is about 0.0001 wt. % to about 1 wt. % (preferably about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. % and more preferably about 0.005 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The polishing composition can comprise an antifoaming agent. The antifoaming agent can be any suitable anti-foaming agent. Suitable antifoaming agents include, but are not limited to, silicon-based and acetylenic diol-based antifoaming agents. The amount of anti-foaming agent in the polishing composition typically is about 10 ppm to about 140 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The polishing composition can comprise a biocide. The biocide can be any suitable biocide, for example, an isothiazolinone biocide. The amount of biocide in the polishing composition typically is about 1 to about 50 ppm, preferably about 10 to about 20 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The polishing composition preferably is colloidally stable. The term colloid refers to the suspension of the particles in the liquid carrier. Colloidal stability refers to the maintenance of that suspension through time. A polishing composition is considered colloidally stable if, when the polishing composition is placed into a 100 ml graduated cylinder and allowed to stand unagitated for a time of 2 hours, the difference between the concentration of particles in the bottom 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([B] in terms of g/ml) and the concentration of particles in the top 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([T] in terms of g/ml) divided by the initial concentration of particles in the polishing composition ([C] in terms of g/ml) is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., {[B]â[T]}/[C]â¦0.5). Preferably, the value of [B]â[T]/[C] is less than or equal to 0.3, more preferably is less than or equal to 0.01, even more preferably is less than or equal to 0.05, and most preferably is less than or equal to 0.01.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The polishing composition can be prepared by any suitable technique, many of which are known to those skilled in the art. The polishing composition can be prepared in a batch or continuous process. Generally, the polishing composition can be prepared by combining the components thereof in any order. The term âcomponentâ as used herein includes individual ingredients (e.g., oxidizing agent, abrasive, etc.) as well as any combination of ingredients (e.g., water, halogen anion, surfactants, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The polishing composition can be supplied as a one-package system comprising the liquid carrier, the abrasive, the oxidizing agent, and optionally other additives. Alternatively, some of the components, such as an oxidizing agent, can be supplied in a first container, either in dry form, or as a solution or dispersion in the liquid carrier, and the remaining components, such as the abrasive and other additives, can be supplied in a second container or multiple other containers. Other two-container, or three or more container combinations of the components of the polishing composition are within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Solid components, such as the abrasive, can be placed in one or more containers either in dry form or as a solution in the liquid carrier. Moreover, it is suitable for the components in the first, second, or other containers to have different pH values, or alternatively to have substantially similar, or even equal, pH values. The components of the polishing composition can be partially or entirely supplied separately from each other and can be combined, e.g., by the end-user, shortly before use (e.g., 1 week or less prior to use, 1 day or less prior to use, 1 hour or less prior to use, 10 minutes or less prior to use, or 1 minute or less prior to use).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The polishing composition also can be provided as a concentrate which is intended to be diluted with an appropriate amount of liquid carrier prior to use. In such an embodiment, the polishing composition concentrate can comprise a liquid carrier and optionally other components in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with an appropriate amount of liquid carrier, each component will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the appropriate range recited above for each component. For example, each component can be present in the concentrate in an amount that is about 2 times (e.g., about 3 times, about 4 times, or about 5 times) greater than the concentration recited above for each component in the polishing composition so that, when the concentrate is diluted with an appropriate volume of liquid carrier (e.g., an equal volume of liquid carrier, 2 equal volumes of liquid carrier, 3 equal volumes of liquid carrier, or 4 equal volumes of liquid carrier, respectively), each component will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the ranges set forth above for each component. Furthermore, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the concentrate can contain an appropriate fraction of the liquid carrier present in the final polishing composition in order to ensure that the other components of the polishing composition are at least partially or fully dissolved or suspended in the concentrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The inventive method of polishing a substrate is particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus. Typically, the apparatus comprises a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving with the platen when in motion, and a carrier that holds a substrate to be polished by contacting and moving relative to the surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with the polishing pad and the polishing composition (which generally is disposed between the substrate and the polishing pad), with the polishing pad moving relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Desirably, the polishing end-point is determined by monitoring the weight of the silicon carbide substrate, which is used to compute the amount silicon carbide removed from the substrate. Such techniques are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Polishing refers to the removal of at least a portion of a surface to polish the surface. Polishing can be performed to provide a surface having reduced surface roughness by removing gouges, crates, pits, and the like, but polishing also can be performed to introduce or restore a surface geometry characterized by an intersection of planar segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The method of the invention can be used to polish any suitable substrate comprising at least one layer of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide can be removed at any suitable rate to effect polishing of the substrate. For example, silicon carbide can be removed at a rate of about 5 nm/hr or more (e.g., about 10 nm/hr or more, about 20 nm/hr or more, about 50 nm/hr or more, about 70 nm/hr or more, about 100 nm/hr or more, or about 200 nm/hr or more). The silicon carbide can be removed at a rate of about 800 nm/hr or less (e.g., about 500 nm/hr or less, about 300 nm/hr or less, about 250 nm/hr or less, or about 200 nm/hr or less). Accordingly, the silicon carbide can be removed from the substrate at a rate of about 5 nm/hr to about 1500 nm/hr (e.g., about 10 nm/hr to about 1000 nm/hr, about 20 nm/hr to about 800 nm/hr, about 30 nm/hr to about 500 nm/hr, about 40 nm/hr to about 300 nm/hr, or about 50 nm/hr to about 180 nm/hr). More preferably, the silicon carbide can be removed from the substrate at a rate of about 20 nm/hr to about 180 nm/hr, about 70 nm/hr to about 180 nm/hr, about 100 nm/hr to about 180 nm/hr, about 30 nm/hr to about 1000 nm/hr, about 100 nm/hr to about 500 nm/hr, or about 200 nm/hr to about 400 nm/hr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.</div>
