<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-294163 filed on Nov. 13, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">A method for polishing an SiC wafer has been proposed in, for example, JP-A-2006-121111 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,835,120) and JP-A-H10-144638. Specifically, JP-A-2006-121111 discloses a polishing apparatus, in which a polishing cloth is attached to a polishing platen, and a wafer holding table is located above the polishing cloth. An SiC wafer is placed on the polishing cloth, and placed between the polishing cloth and the wafer holding table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The polishing apparatus can be used as follows. Such an SiC wafer is prepared that a trench is formed in one surface of the SiC wafer and a trench filling layer is formed in the trench. A groove formed in a surface portion of the trench filling layer is flattened and eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In the above operation, the SiC wafer is interposed between the polishing cloth and the wafer holding table so that the trench filling layer of the SiC wafer faces the polishing cloth. The wafer holding table and the polishing platen are respectively rotated while a chemical solution including abrasive grains is being dropped from an injector located above the polishing cloth. Thereby, a surface portion of the trench filling layer of the SiC wafer is flattened and polished while the SiC wafer is being pressed to the polishing cloth by the wafer holding table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">JP-A-H10-144638 discloses the followings. A pattern for step adjustment is disposed in a periphery of an element region of a semiconductor wafer to flatten irregularities on a film surface. The film surface is target for planarization by polishing or grinding. Thereby, a pressure in grinding or polishing can become constant, and planarizing is uniformly performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Since an SiC wafer is hard next to diamond, even if an oxidation film that functions as stopper is disposed on an SiC wafer, the oxidation film is abraded prior to the SiC wafer. Accordingly, in planarizing and polishing an SiC wafer, it is difficult to selectively polish the SiC wafer by using an oxidation film that functions as a stopper. Thus, the planarizing will be performed without using the oxidation film that functions as a stopper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">When the groove of the trench filling layer of the SiC wafer is attempted to be flattened by using the polishing apparatus according to the JP-A-2006-121111, if a step exists on one surface of the SiC wafer, it is difficult to planarize the one surface with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Even when a pattern for step adjustment is disposed in a periphery of an element region of a semiconductor wafer in such a manner as disclosed in JP-A-H10-144638, if a semiconductor wafer to be grinded or polished is hard one (e.g., SiC wafer), it is difficult to abrade the SiC wafer so that a step on a surface of the SiC wafer is made small. The above difficulty is similar to the case associated with JP-A-2006-121111.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Moreover, the planarizing of an SiC wafer only by polishing according to the above manners results in the SiC wafer having a periphery portion that is polished more than a center portion. It is difficult to planarize the SiC wafer uniformly.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In view of the above and other difficulties, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing an SiC semiconductor apparatus, the method provides an SiC wafer planarized with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor apparatus is provided. The method includes: preparing a semiconductor substrate made of silicon carbide, having a plate shape, and having a front surface and a rear surface; forming an element structure on a front surface side of the semiconductor substrate; placing the semiconductor substrate on a table having a flat surface, so that the front surface of the semiconductor substrate faces the flat surface of the table, after the element structure is formed; grinding or polishing the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate in a direction parallel to the flat surface of the table; grinding and polishing the front surface of the semiconductor substrate in a direction parallel to the rear surface after the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate is grinded or polished.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading>Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">As a related art, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, explanation is given below on reasons why, if a step exists on the surface of the SiC wafer, it is difficult to planarize a surface of an SiC wafer with high accuracy in such a manner as disclosed in JP-A-2006-121111.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a trench <b>51</b> is formed in one surface of a SiC wafer <b>50</b>. A trench filling layer <b>52</b> is formed so as to fill in the trench <b>51</b>. When the trench filling layer <b>52</b> is flattened, abrasive grains located between the polishing cloth and the trench filling layer <b>52</b> can abrade the groove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">When the SiC wafer <b>50</b> has a step region, which is indicated by a dashed line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the planarization is made along the step region. Since the surface and the step are made of the same SiC, it is difficult to selectively remove and flatten a groove that has not a stopper film. Also, when the polishing is performed by using a hard polishing cloth or the like, a damaged layer is left. After the planarizing, it is required to perform polishing again by using a soft polishing cloth. When the polishing is again performed by using the soft polishing cloth, even if the trench filling layer <b>52</b> located on the SiC wafer <b>50</b> is abraded, it is difficult to abrade the SiC wafer <b>50</b> so that the step is made smaller, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Also, when the step is attempted to be eliminated, thinning or dishing may take places to form a recess in the SiC wafer. Accordingly, it is difficult to achieve planarization with high accuracy. In view of the above and other difficulties, exemplary embodiments according to the present invention are presented below.</div>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">A first embodiment according to the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are cross sectional diagrams illustrating manufacturing processes of an SiC semiconductor apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment. Referring to the above FIGS. a method for manufacturing the SiC semiconductor apparatus according to the present embodiment is explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">An SiC wafer <b>10</b> is provided by sublimating SiC powder, re-crystallizing the sublimated SiC and growing a seed crystal to form a bulk single-crystal SiC, cutting the bulk single-crystal SiC into a wafer shape, and mirror-finishing a front surface <b>11</b> (i.e., cutting plane) of the wafer. An SiC layer or a GaN layer is epitaxially grown on the front surface <b>11</b>, and then, a device is formed. In order to obtain an epitaxial layer with high crystallinity, the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is required to be substantially free from defects and be substantially smooth at an atomic level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In the present disclosure, the SiC wafer <b>10</b> corresponds to a semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Then, a process of forming a semiconductor device is performed. In the process, a semiconductor device is formed on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a trench <b>13</b> is formed on a front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> by dry-etching such as reactive ion etching (RIE) or the like. Then, a trench filling layer <b>14</b> is formed in the trench <b>13</b>. The trench <b>13</b> is for an element having a trench filling structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The trench filling layer <b>14</b> may be formed by, for example, epitaxial growth. The trench filling layer <b>14</b> may have a conductivity type different from that of the substrate. The trench filling layer <b>14</b> may have impurity concentrations that vary continuously. Such filling layers can vary according to desired semiconductor elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">When the trench filling layer <b>14</b> is formed in this process, a surface of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> has a morphology originating from a shape of the trench <b>13</b>. That is, a groove <b>15</b> is located on a surface of the trench filling layer <b>14</b>. A structure formed on the surface of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is, for example, the trench <b>13</b>, the trench filling layer <b>14</b>, the groove <b>15</b> of the trench filling layer <b>14</b>, or the like. Such a structure corresponds to an element structure in the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished. In forming the trench filling layer <b>14</b> as described above, the trench filling layer <b>14</b> is formed so as to extend from the front surface <b>11</b> to the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is not parallel to the front surface <b>11</b>. Thus, a difference TTV (total thickness variation) between maximum thickness and minimum thickness of the SiC wafer is large. Accordingly, as shown <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a grinder <b>30</b> having a cylindrical shape is rotated and moved by a driving mechanism (not shown). Thereby, the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished to form a reference plane used for planarizing the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. Since the front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is to be abraded later, the rear surface <b>12</b> is abraded parallel to the front surface <b>11</b> with reference to the front surface <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">A grinding wheel having a cup shape can be used as the grinder <b>30</b>. The grinding wheel having a cup shape has a grinding surface that is located at an open end of a case. Alternatively, a straight cup shaped wheel, a tapered cup shaped wheel, a bowl shaped wheel or the like can be used as the grinding wheel having a cup shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The whole rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished by changing a grain size of the grinder <b>30</b>. Thereby, the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished in a direction parallel to a flat surface and the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> can be adopted as a reference plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished through the above manners, and thereby, it is possible to remove an unwanted film, which is formed in a device process and which extends to the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. Further it is possible to set a difference TTV between the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> and the surface of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> to TTV≦1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a portion of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> has a thickness of, for example, 4 μm with respect to the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. In a subsequent process, the portion of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> located above the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded, and a step on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a grinding process is performed using super-fine abrasive grains having a grain size of, for example, #8000, so that the trench filling layer <b>14</b> located above the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is removed. In the above case, the trench filling layer <b>14</b> is grinded in, for example, such a manner that the grinder <b>40</b> having a cylindrical shape is pressed to the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> while the grinder <b>40</b> having a cylindrical shape is being rotated. According to the above manners, when a step is located on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, the SiC wafer <b>10</b> as well as the trench filling layer <b>14</b> is grinded. The front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded in a direction parallel to the rear surface <b>12</b>. In the present embodiment, the grinding process is performed using super-fine abrasive grains #8000 until the step becomes smaller than 1 μm, the step smaller than 1 μm causing little influence in a subsequent chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing a remnant step on the front surface <b>11</b> after the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to a conventional manner, there is a step left after the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized. According to the present embodiment, however, there is little step left, and further, a surface roughness of the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is 2 nm. This is because it is possible to reliably remove a convex portion of the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> with reference to the reference plane since and because the reference plane is the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, the rear surface <b>12</b> which has been grinded in a direction parallel to the flat plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">After the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded in the above manners, the mirror-finished front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> can be inspected by using, for example, a makyoh. Thereby, it is possible to check whether the whole of the front surface <b>11</b> is grinded and whether there is a step left.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a crushed layer is removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), the crushed layer which is formed on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> in grinding as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. A damaged layer, which causes degradation of an electric property of the semiconductor element from the front surface <b>11</b>, is removed. In the above case, minute removal amount control that involves, for example, a capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement method is employed. The minute removal amount control is performed through the following manners. A small piece of the crushed layer is abraded. It is electrically determined by C-V measurement method whether it is abraded. A removal rate is calculated. In accordance with the removal rate, the crushed layer on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is removed, and the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is polished. In the present embodiment, in order to obtain an electric property of the semiconductor element, the CMP process is performed so that a removal amount due to the CMP process corresponds to 0.1 μm to 1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Through the above manners, the planarization of the front and rear surfaces of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The inventors has studied a thickness variation of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> in a direction parallel to an orientation flat of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows results. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a filling depth of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> corresponding to a depth of the trench <b>13</b> is in a range between 4.35 μm and 5.65 μm. The thickness variation of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> is less than or equal to 1 μm. The results also show that the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded and polished with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Then, a protection film, an electrode and the like are formed on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. An electrode or the like is formed on the rear surface <b>12</b>. Then, the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is divided into individual chips by dicing-cut. Through the above manners, the silicon carbide semiconductor apparatus is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The performing of the above processes is referable to parallel the rear surface <b>12</b> with reference to the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. The rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is paralleled by grinding the rear surface <b>12</b>. If the rear surface <b>12</b> is not paralleled, the front surface <b>11</b> side can be nonuniformly processed, and it becomes difficult to uniformly flatten a small surface step less than or equal to 5 μm. In order to minimize process variation of the groove <b>15</b> of the trench filling layer <b>14</b>, degree of parallelization in grinding the rear surface <b>12</b> is required to be less than or equal to 1 μm. The grinding process easily controls the degree of parallelization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">According to the present embodiment as described above, the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized parallel to the flat surface before the trench filling layer <b>14</b> located on the front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized. Then, the front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized parallel to the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Accordingly, in grinding and polishing the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, the grinding and the polishing can be performed in a direction parallel to the planarized rear surface <b>12</b>. Therefore, it is possible to grind and polish the front surface <b>11</b> so that the step on the front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In the above case, the polishing is performed not along the step of the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> but the grinding and polishing are performed by using super-fine abrasive grains in a direction parallel to the rear surface <b>12</b> that is the reference plane of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. It is therefore possible to planarize the front surface <b>11</b> without generation of the thinning and the dishing. Accordingly, it is possible to planarize the front surface <b>11</b> and the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The planarization of the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> leads to removal of a portion of the trench filling layer <b>14</b>, the portion extending to the rear surface <b>12</b>. Thereby, it is possible to improve accuracy of planarization of the rear surface <b>12</b>, and consequently, it is possible to improve accuracy of planarization of the front surface <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Moreover, since the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is planarized parallel to the planarized rear surface <b>12</b>, it is not required to measure a condition of the front surface <b>11</b>. It is possible to achieve an efficient and short-time planarization.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In the first embodiment, explanation is given on a case where the surface of the trench filling layer <b>14</b> of the element structure is planarized, wherein the element structure is provided by forming the trench <b>13</b> on the front surface <b>11</b> side of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> and by forming the trench filling layer <b>14</b> in the trench <b>13</b>. In the present embodiment, explanation is given on a case where a surface of another element structure is grinded or polished, wherein the another element structure is provided by forming an electrode or the like on a surface of the SiC wafer and by forming a protection film on the electrode or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross sectional diagram illustrating a manufacturing process of a silicon carbide semiconductor apparatus according to the present embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pattern of a line <b>16</b> is formed on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, and a protection film <b>17</b> including a nitride film is formed so as to cover the line <b>16</b>. A surface of the protection film <b>17</b> has a step originating from a step due to the line <b>16</b> and has irregularities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In the present disclosure, a structure formed on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, which is for example the line <b>16</b> or the protection film <b>17</b>, corresponds to an element structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Subsequent processes for planarizing the front surface <b>11</b> and the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC are similar to those according to the first embodiment. That is, the rear surface <b>12</b> is planarized in such a manner that the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished, like a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. After planarizing the rear surface <b>12</b>, the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded and polished with reference to the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>, and thereby, the front surface <b>11</b> is planarized, like a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">As described above, the method according to the first embodiment makes it possible to planarize the front surface <b>11</b> and the rear surface of the SiC wafer that has the line <b>16</b> and the protection film <b>17</b> as the element structure.</div>
<heading>Other Embodiments</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In the above embodiment, explanation is given on flattening the trench filling layer <b>14</b> formed in the SiC wafer <b>10</b>. The method according to the above embodiments can be applied to a case where a hard substance, which is for example sapphire, diamond or the like, is planarized</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The above method can be applied to a wafer manufacturing process. It is possible to provide a high-precision SiC wafer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In the above embodiments, the rear surface <b>12</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> is grinded or polished with reference to the front surface <b>11</b>. Alternatively, a protection tape may be attached to the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> to protect the front surface <b>11</b>. More specifically, a protection tape having adhesive power may be prepared, and an SiC wafer may be fixed to the protection tape. One example of such a protection film is as follows. A base material is thin. The protection tape can absorb a step on the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b> while an adhesive layer is protecting the front surface <b>11</b> of the SiC wafer <b>10</b>.
