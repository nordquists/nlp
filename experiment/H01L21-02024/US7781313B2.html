<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator) wafer having a high degree of flatness when bonded and an epitaxial silicon wafer, and a method for manufacturing a silicon wafer serving as a support substrate for these wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">A highly integrated COMS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor), an IC, a high-withstand voltage device, and others have been conventionally fabricated by utilizing an SOI wafer. The SOI wafer in which a single-crystal silicon layer used as a device forming region is formed on an insulating layer is effective for prevention of latch-up (an abnormal oscillation phenomenon due to a parasitic circuit) in case of a highly integrated circuit and insulative isolation from a base substrate in case of a high-withstand voltage device. As a method for manufacturing this SOI wafer, a method of bonding silicon wafers to each other through a silicon dioxide layer, i.e., an insulating layer is known, an SOI wafer fabricated by this bonding method has very excellent crystallinity of an SOI layer, and hence this method appears promising.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, since the insulating layer formed of the silicon oxide layer has a smaller thermal expansion coefficient than single-crystal silicon, there is an inconvenience. For example, the SOI layer side warps into a convex shape and an adsorption error occurs in a device process when an oxide film is not formed on a backside surface of a support substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In order to eliminate this problem, there have been proposed method for manufacturing an SOI wafer heating both wafers to a predetermined temperature to be bonded to each other, then performing a thermal oxidation processing with respect to these wafers to form an oxide film on an entire surface thereof, polishing a surface of one wafer which is preferably a wafer having an oxide film formed thereon before bonding, and reducing a thickness of this wafer, thereby obtaining a bonded wafer (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 250615-1991 (claims)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Further, in an epitaxial silicon wafer having an epitaxial layer grown on an epitaxial growth silicon wafer formed of silicon single crystal, it is known that warpage occurs when a resistivity value in the epitaxial growth silicon wafer is different from a resistivity value in the epitaxial layer. That is because elastic deformation due to misfit in grating constant between the epitaxial layer and the epitaxial growth silicon wafer as a substrate occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In order to solve this problem, there has been proposed a method for manufacturing an epitaxial silicon wafer identifying irregularities in a warped shape of an epitaxial growth silicon wafer, estimating warpage that occurs when an epitaxial layer is formed on a surface of this wafer, and forming the epitaxial layer on the concave surface of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 112120-1994 (claims)). According to this method for manufacturing, warpage of the surface of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer is identified in advance, a direction of this warpage is set to a direction opposite to a direction of a warping change that occurs in epitaxial growth, and the warping change in epitaxial growth is thereby canceled out, thus reducing an absolute value of warpage of the epitaxial silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, the SOI wafer avoids warpage by providing the oxide film on upper and lower surfaces of a support substrate silicon wafer thereof. Therefore, presence of the oxide film on the lower surface of the SOI wafer is necessarily the premise for avoiding warpage, but the oxide film present on the lower surface of the SOI wafer may be removed in a subsequent device process in some cases. This SOI wafer still has a problem to be solved. Namely, when the oxide film on the lower surface is removed in the device process, unevenness in thermal shrinkage amounts on the upper and lower surfaces of the support substrate silicon wafer occurs, and the SOI wafer newly warps in the device process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Further, in the epitaxial silicon wafer, when an ingot formed of a silicon single crystal is sliced into a thin discoid shape by using, e.g., an inner diameter slicer or a wire saw device, warpage can be given to the wafer in advance. On the other hand there is an inconvenience that an amount of warpage is relatively large and becomes uneven in a moving direction perpendicular to a moving direction of the inner diameter slicer or a traveling direction of a wire for slicing the ingot. Moreover, there is still a problem to be solved. That is, obtaining a flat epitaxial silicon wafer is difficult even if an epitaxial layer is formed on a surface of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer having such uneven warpage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a silicon wafer, which can obtain an SOI wafer or an epitaxial silicon wafer having a high degree of flatness.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">A first aspect of the present invention pertains to a method for manufacturing a silicon wafer, wherein a thin discoid silicon wafer is subjected to one or both of grinding and polishing to give bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at a central part to a wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">When such an SOI wafer is obtained based on a method for bonding using the silicon wafer according to the first aspect, forcible warpage given to this silicon wafer by grinding/polishing can assuredly cancel out warpage that is newly produced in the SOI wafer when the SOI wafer is obtained, thereby acquiring the flat SOI wafer.</div>

Thus a finished silicon wafer becomes flat.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">An embodiment for carrying out the present invention will now be explained hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a silicon wafer characterized in that a thin discoid wafer is subjected to one or both of grinding and polishing to give bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at a central part to a wafer surface. That is, the bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part is given to the silicon wafer to be obtained by performing one or both of grinding and polishing in such a manner that a central point of a thickness at the wafer central part is placed at a position lower than the central point of the thickness at a wafer outer peripheral part. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when obtaining an SOI wafer <b>21</b> based on a bonding method using this silicon wafer <b>12</b>, an amount of the warpage is less than 0 μm (a negative value) in a so-called bow value. That is, when a surface having a concave shape is determined as a front surface side (an upper side), the concave warpage is formed so that a displacement amount (a distance A) from a three-point reference surface of a best-fit reference surface of a backside surface of a support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> that is not adsorbed and fixed to the central point in a thickness direction at the central part of the wafer <b>12</b> becomes less than 0 μm (a negative value).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part is formed to previously give warpage to the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> so as to cancel out warpage that is produced in the SOI wafer <b>21</b> when performing a heat treatment at the time of bonding, then effecting cooling, and grinding or polishing a surface of one bonding silicon wafer <b>11</b> or when removing an oxide film on the backside surface of the SOI wafer. Furthermore, as to an amount of warpage provided to the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b>, in case of the general SOI wafer <b>21</b> in which a diameter is 150 mm, a thickness of an SOI layer is 2 μm, a thickness of a Box layer as a buried oxide film layer is 1.0 μm, and a thickness of the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> is 675 μm, it has been revealed from experiences that warpage of approximately 60 μm in a warp value is produced. Therefore, warpage of approximately −30 μm in the bow value must be given to the support substrate wafer <b>12</b> in advance. This amount of warpage fluctuates depending on respective thicknesses of the SOI layer, the Box layer, the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b>, and the backside surface oxide layer of the SOI wafer <b>21</b> to be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">It is to be noted that the warp is a value represented as a difference between a maximum displacement and a minimum displacement from the three-point reference surface or the best-fit reference surface to a central surface in the wafer thickness direction of the backside surface of the wafer that is not adsorbed and fixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">On the other hand, uniformity of a thickness of this support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> is also important to obtain the SOI wafer <b>21</b> having a high degree of flatness. Therefore, the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> according to the present invention must have a uniform thickness, and it is preferable for a specific variation of the thickness to fall within the range of 1 μm or below in a GBIR evaluation. That is because, when the GBIR exceeds 1 μm, a degree of flatness in the obtained SOI wafer <b>21</b> cannot be sufficiently increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">On the other hand, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) show cross-sectional views of an example of obtaining an epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b>. In this case, an epitaxial layer <b>111</b> is formed on a surface of a silicon wafer <b>112</b> having bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at a central part, thereby obtaining the epitaxial silicon wafer. This silicon wafer <b>112</b> is manufactured by performing one or both of grinding and polishing to a thin discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4)</figref> that is acquired by using, e.g., an inner diameter slicer or a wire saw device to slice a silicon single-crystal ingot which has boron doped therein to have a specific resistivity of 0.001 Ωcm to 0.1 Ωcm and is pulled up by a CZ method or an FZ method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part is forcibly given to the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> by performing one or both of grinding and polishing in such a manner that a central point in a central surface of the thin discoid wafer in the thickness direction is placed at a position lower than a central point of a wafer circumference in the thickness direction, and a specific resistivity of this wafer falls within the range of 0.005 to 0.01 Ωcm. Furthermore, it is preferable for its amount of warpage to fall within the range of −5 μm to −60 μm in a so-called bow value. That is, the concave warpage is formed so that a displacement amount (a distance A) from a three-point reference surface or a best-fit reference surface of a backside surface of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> that is not adsorbed and fixed to a central point at the central part of the wafer <b>112</b> in the thickness direction falls within the range of −5 μm to −60 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Forming the concave warpage in the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> corresponds to previously giving warpage to cancel out warpage that is produced in the epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b> due to formation of an epitaxial layer <b>111</b> when the epitaxial layer <b>111</b> is formed on a surface of this silicon wafer <b>112</b> to obtain the epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">On the other hand, uniformity of a thickness of this epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> is also important to obtain the epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b> having a high degree of flatness. Therefore, the thickness of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> according to the present invention must be uniform. As a specific variation of the thickness, a difference between the thickest part and the thinnest part preferably falls within the range of 1.0% of the thickest part, and more preferably falls within the range of 0.5%. That is because, when a difference between the thickest part and the thinnest part exceeds 1.0% of the thickest part, the warpage of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> has such a shape that a part of the surface of this wafer is not uniform, or geometric conical warpage is not produced, and the degree of flatness in the obtained epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b> cannot be sufficiently increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>)-(<i>d</i>) show cross-sectional views of a procedure of obtaining the silicon wafer <b>12</b> or <b>112</b> having the bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part. Although obtaining the silicon wafer <b>12</b> having the bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part will be described as a representative example with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the procedure is the same when obtaining the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b>. That is, this silicon wafer <b>12</b> is obtained by grinding and polishing a discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> by using a grinding device <b>31</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref> show the grinding device <b>31</b> that is used to obtain this support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b>. This grinding device <b>31</b> includes a tabular holding table <b>32</b> which sucks the discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> mounted on a flat upper surface and maintains the silicon wafer <b>13</b> in a state where its lower surface is forcibly flattened, a plurality of quadratic-prism-like grinding wheel <b>33</b> that grind an upper surface of the silicon wafer <b>13</b> held by this table <b>32</b>, a grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> that holds these grinding wheel <b>33</b> so as to be placed on the same circumference with a rotary shaft <b>34</b> at the center, a rotating motor <b>37</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8)</figref> that rotates the grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> via the rotary shaft <b>34</b>, and non-illustrated sliding means that holds this rotating motor <b>37</b> to allow its elevating motion. Here, as the grinding wheel <b>33</b>, one obtained by bonding abrasive grains each having a grain size of approximately #300 through a metal bond is used for primary grinding, and one obtained by bonding abrasive grains each having a grain size of #1500 (an average particle diameter: 7.5 μm) to #10000 (an average particle diameter: 0.5 μm) through resin bond or a vitrifying bond is used for secondary grinding. This grinding wheel <b>33</b> functions as damage reducing means that suppresses a damage on a ground surface of the discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> to 5 μm or below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the holding table <b>32</b> is a circular plate formed of porous ceramics, and this holding table <b>32</b> is embedded in a support base <b>38</b>. The support base <b>38</b> is supported by one fixed shaft <b>41</b> and two elevating shafts <b>42</b> and <b>42</b> above a fixed base <b>39</b>. When a supporting point of the support base <b>38</b> is moved up and down by the two elevating shafts <b>42</b> and <b>42</b> to incline the support base <b>38</b>, and a horizontal upper surface of the holding table <b>32</b> embedded in the support base <b>38</b> can be inclined at a desired angle. Further, non-illustrated rotating means that rotates the holding table <b>32</b> is provided to the support base <b>38</b>, and this the holding table <b>32</b> can be rotated without changing an angle of the inclined upper surface in a state where the upper surface of the holding table <b>32</b> is inclined. Here, although the example where the holding table <b>32</b> is inclined has been explained, the rotary shaft <b>34</b> of the grinding wheel <b>33</b> may be inclined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method of grinding and polishing the discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> by the thus configured grinding device <b>31</b> to manufacture the silicon wafer <b>12</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one main surface of the silicon wafer <b>13</b> is adsorbed and held and the other main surface of the same is subjected to one or both of grinding and polishing to manufacture a convex wafer <b>14</b> whose thickness is increased from a wafer outer periphery toward the water center, then the other main surface formed into a convex shape is adsorbed and held to protrude the center of one main surface side based on elastic deformation, the one main surface is subjected to one or both of grinding and polishing to provide the flat main surface, and adsorption and holding are released, thereby obtaining the wafer having bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part. These steps will now be explained specifically hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">&lt;Backside Surface Grinding Step&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">First, the discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> is prepared. This discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> can be fabricated by slicing a silicon single-crystal rod pulled up based on a CZ method or an FZ method. As indicated by a broken line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>), the surface of this discoid silicon wafer <b>13</b> is mounted on the tabular holding table <b>32</b>, and the silicon wafer <b>13</b> is adsorbed by the holding table <b>32</b> with a backside surface of the silicon wafer <b>13</b> being determined as an upper surface. Then, the support base <b>38</b> having the holding table <b>32</b> embedded therein is inclined together with this holding table <b>32</b>. The support base <b>38</b> is inclined by moving up and down the supporting point of the support base <b>38</b> by using the two elevating shafts <b>42</b> and <b>42</b> that support this supporting table <b>38</b>, and the horizontal upper surface of the holding table embedded in this support base <b>38</b> is inclined at a desired angle as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this state, the holding table <b>32</b> is rotated together with the silicon wafer <b>13</b> in a direction indicted by a solid line arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> is rotated in a direction of a broken line arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the rotating motor <b>37</b>. Subsequently, the grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> is moved down to bring the grinding wheel <b>33</b> into contact with the backside surface of the silicon wafer <b>13</b>, and this silicon wafer <b>13</b> is ground by the grinding wheel <b>33</b> from the backside surface side. Further, since the holding table <b>32</b> is inclined, the ground backside surface has an angular shape as indicated by a solid line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>), and this silicon wafer <b>13</b> becomes an intermediate wafer <b>14</b> whose backside surface has a protruding center so that the center thereof has a large thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In case of obtaining the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b>, since the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> having a conical concave surface like a sharpened central edge formed thereon has a tendency that the nano-topography is degraded at the wafer central part in a surface flatness evaluation after epitaxial growth, it is desirable to grind the wafer into a concave shape in such a manner that the entire concave surface has a gentle curved shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">&lt;Surface Grinding Step&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Then, the silicon wafer <b>13</b> is ground from the front surface side. To perform this step, the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> ground to protrude the center of the backside surface thereof is removed from the holding table <b>32</b>. Further, the backside surface having the protruding center is mounted on the holding table <b>32</b> as indicated by a solid line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>b</i>), the backside surface is adsorbed to hold the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> on the flat upper surface of the holding table <b>32</b> as indicated by broken line arrows. Then, as indicated by a broken line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>b</i>), since the upper surface of the holding table <b>32</b> is flat, the backside surface of the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> is elastically deformed to become flat in a state where it is adsorbed by the holding table, and the center of the front surface of the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> contrarily protrudes upward. Moreover, before or after the backside surface of the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> is adsorbed and held by the holding table <b>32</b>, the supporting point of the support base <b>38</b> is moved up and down by the two elevating shafts <b>42</b> and <b>42</b> that support the support base <b>38</b> to restore the support base <b>38</b> to the horizontal state as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and the upper surface of the holding table <b>32</b> embedded in the support base <b>38</b> is restored to the horizontal state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Then, the holding table <b>32</b> is rotated together with the intermediate wafer <b>14</b>, and the grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> is also rotated by the rotating motor <b>37</b>. Subsequently, the grinding wheel holder <b>36</b> is moved down in a direction of a solid line arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>c</i>), and the grinding wheel <b>33</b> are brought into contact with the front surface of the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> to grind the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> with the grinding wheel <b>33</b> from the front surface side. Additionally, since the holding table <b>32</b> is restored to the horizontal state, the ground surface becomes parallel to the holding table <b>32</b> and has a uniform thickness as indicated by a broken line. When the intermediate wafer <b>14</b> having such a uniform thickness is removed from the holding table <b>32</b>, the wafer <b>14</b> is restored by elasticity as indicated by an arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>d</i>), thus obtaining the silicon wafer <b>12</b> having the bowl shape that is concave at the center of the front surface thereof and also having the uniform thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Here, the bowl-shaped silicon wafer <b>12</b> that is concave at the central part includes a wafer that is ground into a concave shape in such a manner that an entire concave surface has a gentle curved surface, a wafer having a concave shape that is slightly corrugated in a circumferential direction, a wafer having a substantially conical shape, and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">According to such a manufacturing method of a silicon wafer, it is possible to obtain the silicon wafer <b>12</b> with the concave warpage given thereto in such a manner that a central point of a thickness at the wafer central part is placed at a position lower than a central point of a thickness at the wafer outer peripheral part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">It is to be noted that the procedure of the surface grinding step when manufacturing the convex intermediate wafer <b>14</b> whose backside surface protrudes at the center in such a manner that the center of the silicon wafer <b>13</b> has a large thickness and the backside surface grinding step when using this convex wafer has been explained as the surface grinding step and the backside surface grinding step in the embodiment according to the present invention. However, even if the concave intermediate wafer <b>14</b> whose backside surface is hollow at the center in such a manner that the silicon wafer <b>13</b> has a small wall thickness at the center is first fabricated and then the convex silicon wafer <b>14</b> with the uniform thickness is manufactured, this wafer can be used as the same concave silicon wafer <b>12</b> when inverted. Contrary, when the concave wafer is fabricated and then inverted, this wafer can be used as the convex wafer. In short, using a wafer having warpage in a direction opposite to a direction of warpage of the SOI wafer as a support substrate can suffice in manufacture of the SOI wafer, and using a wafer having warpage in a direction opposite to warpage of the epitaxial wafer as a front-surface-side wafer can suffice in epitaxial growth processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Moreover, the example of using the grinding device <b>31</b> to process the wafer at each grinding step has been explained.

In this case, a mirror polishing step before fabrication of the SOI wafer can be omitted, and the mirror polishing step before epitaxial growth processing can be also omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A manufacturing method of the SOI wafer <b>21</b> using the silicon wafer <b>12</b> having the bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the central part as the support substrate will now be explained in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Then, a silicon single-crystal ingot pulled up by the CZ method was sliced by a wire saw to additionally prepare <b>25</b> bonding silicon wafers <b>11</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">The bonding silicon wafer <b>11</b> having the insulating layer <b>11</b> <i>a </i>formed thereon and the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> were cleaned with an SC1 (Standard Cleaning 1) cleaning liquid which was prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of NH<sub>4</sub>OH having a specific gravity of 0.9, an aqueous solution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>having a specific gravity of 1.1, and H<sub>2</sub>O at a capacity ratio of NH<sub>4</sub>OH:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O=1:2:7 and maintained at approximately 80° C., and then the bonding silicon wafer <b>11</b> was superimposed on and bonded to the surface of the support substrate silicon wafer <b>12</b> that is concave at the center with the insulating layer <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>11</b> being determined as a bonding surface as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>c</i>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Although not shown, a silicon single-crystal ingot pulled up by the CZ method was sliced by a wire saw to additionally prepare <b>25</b> thin discoid support substrate silicon wafers.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">On the other hand, the same <b>25</b> bonding silicon wafers as Example 1 were prepared, and an insulating layer made of a silicon oxide layer (SiO<sub>2</sub>) with a thickness of 0.5 μm was formed on an entire surface of each bonding silicon wafer under the same conditions as Example 1.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Warpage of each of the 25 SOI wafers <b>21</b> according to Example 1 and the 25 SOI wafers according to Comparative Example 1 was measured by the flatness-measuring instrument manufactured by ADE Corporation, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>) show their distributions. The warpage distributions in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>) show warpage distributions represented by so-called warp values, and this warp value is a value represented as a difference between a maximum displacement and a minimum displacement from a three-point reference surface or a best-fit reference surface of a backside surface of a wafer that is not adsorbed and fixed to a central surface in a wafer thickness direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Here, the warpage distribution in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>) is represented by bow values so that a height level of irregularities can be recognized and the warpage distribution in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>) is represented by warp values because a warp value in which the warpage distribution of the entire wafer is reflected is generally used as a specification of the wafer warpage. As apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>), warpage (bow values) of the silicon wafers serving as the support substrates falls within the range of −5 μm to +5 μm and its average value is −2.3 μm in Comparative Example 1. However, in Example 1, warpage is concentrated in the range of −20 μm to −30 μm and its average value is −28.1 μm, thereby obtaining a warpage amount that is relatively stable on a negative side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">On the other hand, as apparent from results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>), warpage of the SOI wafers <b>21</b> represented by so-called warp values in Example 1 is concentrated on 20 μm, and its average value is 18.5 μm. However, warpage of the SOI wafers represented by so-called warp values in Comparative Example 1 is concentrated on 50 μm that is a larger value than that in Example 1, and its average value is 48.9 μm. That is, it can be understood that each SOI wafer <b>21</b> according to Example 1 has a smaller flat warpage (warp) value than that of each SOI wafer according to Comparative Example 1.

<heading>Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">First, a silicon single-crystal ingot having boron doped therein was pulled up by the CZ method.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Thereafter, each intermediate wafer <b>14</b> having the uniform thickness was removed from the holding table <b>32</b> and restored based on resistivity, thereby obtaining 50 epitaxial growth silicon wafers <b>112</b> each having a bowl-like shape that is concave at a central part of the front surface and also having a uniform thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">When a specific resistivity of each of the 50 epitaxial growth silicon wafers <b>112</b> was measured by a four-probe resistivity measuring instrument, a result was 0.006 to 0.009 Ωcm, and this value falls within the range of 0.05 to 0.01 Ωcm.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Further, a warpage status of a surface of arbitrary one selected from the 50 wafers was observed by using the flatness-measuring instrument manufactured by the ADE Corporation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows this warpage situation.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Then, the surface of each of these epitaxial growth silicon wafers was mirror-polished so as to have a thickness of 775 μm.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Subsequently, an epitaxial layer <b>111</b> was formed on a the concave surface of the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>112</b> having the bowl-shaped warpage that is concave at the center as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, thereby obtaining an epitaxial silicon wafer <b>121</b>.

It can be considered that such a surface shape is provided because an amount of warpage in a moving direction perpendicular to a traveling direction of a wire for slicing the ingot is relatively large even though an amount of warpage in the traveling direction of the wire in the wire saw device used to slice the ingot is relatively small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Subsequently, an epitaxial layer having a specific resistivity of approximately 1 Ωcm and a thickness of 3 μm was formed on the surface of each epitaxial growth silicon wafer based on the same conditions and the same procedure as Example 2, thereby obtaining each epitaxial silicon wafer. Each of the 50 epitaxial silicon wafers was determined as Comparative Example 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0014">&lt;Comparative Test and Evaluation&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Warpage of each of the 50 epitaxial silicon wafers according to Example 2 and the 50 epitaxial silicon wafers according to Comparative Example 2 was measured by the flatness-measuring instrument manufactured by ADE Corporation, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>12</b>(<i>b</i>) show their distributions. The warpage distribution in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>12</b>(<i>b</i>) shows a warpage distribution represented by so-called warp values, and this warp value is a value represented as a difference between a maximum displacement and a minimum displacement from a three-point reference surface or a best-fit reference surface of a backside surface of the wafer that is not adsorbed and fixed to a central surface in a wafer thickness direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Here, the warpage distribution in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <b>12</b>(<i>a</i>) is represented in the form of bow values so that a height level of irregularities can be recognized and the warpage distribution in each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>12</b>(<i>b</i>) is represented in the form of warp values because the warp value in which the warpage distribution of the entire wafer is reflected is generally used as a specification of the wafer warpage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">As apparent from the result depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>) and <b>12</b>(<i>b</i>), the warpage of each epitaxial silicon wafer <b>21</b> according to Example 2 represented by a so-called warp value is concentrated on 13 μm, and its average value is 13.0 μm. However, the warpage of each epitaxial silicon wafer according to Comparative Example 2 represented by a so-called warp value is concentrated on 23 μm that is a larger value than that in Example 2, and its average value is 23.0 μm. That is, it can be understood that the warpage of the epitaxial silicon wafer <b>21</b> according to Example 2 is 10 μm reduced as compared with the epitaxial silicon wafer according to Comparative Example 2. It can be considered that this reduction occurs because the bowl-shaped warpage concave at the central part that is formed to the epitaxial growth silicon wafer <b>12</b> according to Example 2 cancels out warpage that is produced when the epitaxial silicon wafer <b>21</b> is obtained, and the effect of the present invention was confirmed.</div>
