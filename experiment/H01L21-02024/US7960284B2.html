<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Technical Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to methods of manufacturing Group III-V compound semiconductor substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">III-V compound semiconductor substrates are manufactured by slicing off substrates from an ingot, and polishing and thereafter cleaning the substrate surfaces. (Cf. Japanese Unexamined Pat. App. Pub. No. H05-291231.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Polishing the surface of a III-V compound semiconductor substrate, however, subjects the surface to damage. As a consequence, the substrate's photoluminescence intensity (PL intensity) is degraded. Forming semiconductor devices on the surface of a III-V compound substrate that carries damage is a futile exercise, if outstanding device characteristics are sought.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Given that polishing produces superficial damage on III-V compound substrates, the present inventors investigated dry-etching the post-polished surface as a means of removing the damage-affected material. The results of their investigations confirmed improvement in the PL intensity of III-V compound substrates. Nevertheless, further improvement in III-V semiconductor substrate PL intensity is being sought, in order yield prevailing superior device characteristics.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">An object of the present invention, brought about in view of the circumstances described above, is to make available a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method whereby the PL intensity of the III-V substrates can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In order to resolve the issues discussed above, a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method of the present invention includes: a polishing step of polishing a surface of a platelike III-V compound semiconductor crystal; a cleaning step, subsequent to the polishing step, of cleaning said surface of the III-V compound semiconductor crystal; a first dry-etching step, subsequent to the cleaning step, of applying first bias power to an electrode for carrying the III-V compound semiconductor crystal, and meanwhile subjecting said III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface to first dry-etching employing a first halogen-containing gas; and a second dry-etching step, subsequent to the first dry-etching step, of applying to the electrode second bias power that is less than the first bias power, and meanwhile subjecting said III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface to second dry-etching employing a second halogen-containing gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Herein, the first and second halogen-containing gases employed respectively in the first and second dry-etching steps may be of the same type, or may be different from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method of the present invention, the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface is damaged during the polishing step. The damage can be subsequently removed by carrying out the first and second dry-etching steps following the cleaning step. Furthermore, the fact that bias power in the second dry-etching is smaller than that in the first dry-etching means that the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface less is likely to be damaged by the second dry-etching itself. The III-V compound semiconductor substrate PL intensity therefore can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Furthermore, in the polishing step, the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface is preferably polished until the arithmetic-mean roughness of the surface decreases to 50 Å or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">It will be appreciated that the arithmetic-mean roughness can be decreased in the polishing step by, for example, decreasing the mean grain diameter of the abrasive particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Performing polishing in the manner as described above makes the arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra<sub>2</sub>) after the second dry-etching step smaller than arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra<sub>1</sub>) before the first dry-etching step. For this reason, the planarity of the III-V compound semiconductor substrate surface can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Moreover, it is preferable that: the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface has an elemental Group III-substance face and an elemental Group V-substance face; the polishing step includes a chemical polishing process of chemically polishing the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface; and as at least one of a chemical solution employed in the chemical polishing process and a cleaning solution employed in the cleaning step, a solution containing at least one among aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and hydrofluoric acid is utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Herein, the term “chemical polishing” means that so-called chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Employing such a solution makes it possible to prevent the elemental V-substance face (such as the N face) from being etched selectively relative to the elemental III-substance face by at least one of the chemical solution and the cleaning solution, in at least one of the chemical polishing step and the cleaning step. Preventing such selective etching keeps difference in height between the elemental III-substance and the elemental V-substance faces from increasing, meaning that the III-V compound semiconductor substrate surface planarity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Furthermore, the III-V compound semiconductor crystal preferably contains as the elemental III substance at least one among Ga, In, and Al, and as the elemental V substance at least one among As, P, and N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In such a III-V compound semiconductor crystal, the atomic weights of the elemental III substance and the elemental V substance are comparatively small, which facilitates polishing and dry-etching the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The present invention affords III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing methods that enable improvement of III-V compound semiconductor substrate PL intensity.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Hereinafter, referring to the accompanying drawings, an explanation of embodiments of the present invention will be made in detail. It should be understood that in describing the drawings, with the same reference marks being used for identical or equivalent features, reduplicating description will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic perspective view showing a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufactured by the III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method involving embodiments of the present invention. An orientation flat <b>10</b> <i>e </i>is formed on the edge of a III-V compound semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (substrate <b>10</b>, hereinafter) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In place of the orientation flat <b>10</b> <i>e</i>, a notch may be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The substrate <b>10</b> preferably contains as the elemental III substance at least one of Ga, In, and Al, and as the elemental V substance at least one of As, P and N. The substrate <b>10</b> may be, to cite exemplary substrates, a GaAs, GaP or InP substrate, or a nitride semiconductor substrate (III-V compound semiconductor substrate containing N as the elemental V substance) such as a GaN, AlN or InN substrate. The substrate <b>10</b> may be an impurity-doped substrate, a substrate composed of a ternary III-V compound semiconductor, or a substrate composed of a quaternary III-V compound semiconductor such as GaInNAs. Also, the substrate <b>10</b> may be a single-crystal substrate, or a polycrystalline substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart representing steps of a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method involving embodiments of the present invention. The substrate <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is manufactured in the following manner, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In an exemplary implementation in which the substrate <b>10</b> is a GaAs substrate or an InP substrate, an ingot is first created by, for example, the liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) method, by vapor-phase epitaxy such as the halogen transport method, or by the horizontal Bridgeman (HB) method. Next, the ingot is peripherally processed so as to have the desired diameter. Subsequently, a crystallographic orientation of the ingot is determined by X-ray diffraction, and then an orientation flat (OF) and an index flat (IF) are formed on the ingot. Furthermore, the ingot is sliced with a wire saw, outer diameter saw, internal diameter saw, or like cutting tool to separate wafers (platelike III-V compound semiconductor crystals) from the ingot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Meanwhile, in an exemplary implementation in which the substrate <b>10</b> is a nitride semiconductor substrate, nitride semiconductor crystal is grown by vapor phase techniques on a non-native crystal substrate whose thermal expansion coefficient is close to that of the nitride semiconductor of which the nitride semiconductor substrate is composed. Examples of non-native substrates include Si, GaAs, SiC and sapphire. After that, a wafer may be produced from the nitride semiconductor crystal by separating away the non-native substrate, or wafers may be cut from the vapor-phase-grown nitride semiconductor crystal by slicing it employing, for example, a wire saw, outer diameter saw, internal diameter saw, or other cutting tool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Next, the surface of the produced wafer is planarized. Planarization is carried out by putting the wafer through the process steps represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The wafer surface that is planarized is at least one of either the principal face or the back side (face on the opposite side from the principal face) of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">Grinding Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">First, the wafer surface is ground (grinding step S<b>1</b>). In the grinding step S<b>1</b>, the wafer is attached with wax to, for example, a ceramic plate, and a diamond grinding wheel is while being rotated pressed against the wafer surface, while grinding fluid is supplied to between the wafer and the diamond wheel. In this manner, the wafer surface is ground with the diamond wheel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">Polishing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Second, the wafer surface is polished. It is preferable that the wafer surface is mechanically polished (mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b>), and then is chemically polished (chemical polishing process S<b>5</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In the mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b>, a copper or tin platen is pressed against the wafer surface while being rotated, while a polishing agent (for example, diamond slurry) is supplied to between the surface of the wafer attached to the ceramic plate and the platen. In this manner, the wafer surface is polished with the polishing agent. Herein, it is preferable that the mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b> is repeated more than once, and every time the mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b> is repeated, the mean grain diameter of the abrasive particles contained in the polishing agent is gradually decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the chemical polishing step S<b>5</b>, a polishing pad (for example, a suede-like pad) is pressed against the wafer surface while being rotated, while a chemical solution is supplied to between the surface of the wafer attached to the ceramic plate and the polishing pad. As a result, the contaminants (for example, the wax and polishing agent) and metal ions adhering to the wafer surface can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The chemical solution employed in the chemical polishing step S<b>5</b> preferably has no, or little, reactivity with III-V compound semiconductor substrates, and preferably removes metal ions and contaminants. Examples of such chemical solutions include solutions containing at least among aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and hydrofluoric acid. In particular, aqueous hydrogen peroxide is preferable because it has mild acidity, and thus its damage on the polishing device and associated components is slight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Generally, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, aqueous ammonia, potassium hydrate, and sodium hydrate are well known as etchants for III-V compound semiconductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">For example, when employed singly, with the exception of hydrochloric acid, etchants such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid etch GaAs crystal and InP crystal only slightly; GaAs and InP crystals are etched with a combination of the above etchants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">On the other hand, as to GaN crystal, AlN crystal and other nitride semiconductor crystals, employing, for example, etchants such as phosphoric acid, aqueous ammonia, potassium hydrate, or sodium hydrate results in that the N faces of the nitride semiconductor crystals are readily etched, but their elemental III-substance faces, such as Ga and Al faces, are etched only slightly. For this reason, on the wafer surface having both an elemental III-substance face and a N face, there is a risk that the difference in height between the elemental III-substance face and the N face increases. Compared with these etchants, utilizing as etchant a liquid containing at least one of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, or hydrofluoric acid results in that both the elemental III-substance face and the N face are etched only slightly, preventing difference in height between the elemental III-substance face and the N face from increasing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">First Cleaning Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Next, the wafer surface is cleaned (a first cleaning step S<b>7</b>). In the first cleaning step S<b>7</b>, first, the wafer is detached from the ceramic plate. Next, in order to remove wax and polishing agent clinging to the wafer surface, ultrasonic cleaning in which as solvent, ethanol, for example, is utilized is performed. Furthermore, the wafer is soaked in, for example, hydrochloric acid, and is oscillated, to remove metal ions clinging to the wafer surface. To oscillate the wafer, the cleaning jig is vibrated and ultrasonic cleaning is performed; in particular, performing ultrasonic cleaning is preferable. Subsequently, the wafer surface is rinsed under flowing ultrapure water. Next, the wafer is dried employing, for example, isopropyl alcohol vapor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">As cleaning solution employed for wafers such as GaAs substrates and InP substrates in the first cleaning step, a cleaning fluid employed to clean Si substrates may utilized, and a chemical solution may be combined with the cleaning fluid. Furthermore, as cleaning solution employed for GaN substrates, AlN substrates and other nitride semiconductor substrates in the first cleaning step, a liquid containing, similarly to the chemical solution employed in the chemical polishing process S<b>5</b>, at least one of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, or hydrofluoric acid is preferably utilized. Utilizing such a solution lessens difference between the speed at which the elemental III-substance face (for example, Ga face or Al face) is etched, and the speed at which the N face is etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">First Dry-Etching Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Next, the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of a wafer <b>3</b> is subjected to first dry-etching, employing a plasma etching apparatus <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (first dry-etching (high bias) step S<b>9</b>). It is preferable that the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> is entirely dry-etched. Furthermore, reactive dry etching (RIE) is preferably adopted as the dry etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a plasma etching apparatus. A plasma etching apparatus <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is provided with a chamber <b>21</b>, an antenna <b>22</b>, a high-frequency power source <b>23</b> <i>a</i>, a bias supply <b>23</b> <i>b</i>, a chuck <b>24</b>, and RF matching circuitry <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and <b>25</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The chamber <b>21</b> is a unit for housing the wafer <b>3</b>, and the interior of the chamber <b>21</b> is kept high-temperature and low-pressure. The antenna <b>22</b>, which is one electrode for generating plasma within the chamber <b>21</b>, is disposed in the upper part of the chamber <b>21</b>. The antenna <b>22</b> is in the form of a flat or spiral coil. The antenna <b>22</b> is electrically linked via the RF matching circuitry <b>25</b> <i>a </i>to the high-frequency power source <b>23</b> <i>a </i>for generating high RF power at, for example, 13.56 MHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The chuck <b>24</b> is a constituent element for carrying and holding the wafer <b>3</b>. The chuck <b>24</b> is electrically linked via the RF matching circuitry <b>25</b> <i>b </i>to the bias supply <b>23</b> <i>b</i>. The bias supply <b>23</b> <i>b </i>applies to the chuck <b>24</b> high-frequency bias power of, for example, 13.56 MHz. The chuck <b>24</b> acts as an electrode for applying bias power to the wafer <b>3</b>. Between the antenna <b>22</b> and the chuck <b>24</b>, plasma is generated by the high-frequency power supply <b>23</b> <i>a</i>. The generated plasma is accelerated toward the chuck <b>24</b> by an electric field set up by the bias power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Within the chamber <b>21</b>, shields <b>21</b> <i>b </i>and <b>21</b> <i>c </i>for blocking electromagnetic waves generated by the high-frequency voltage are provided so as to surround the chuck <b>24</b>. Additionally, an exhaust duct <b>21</b> <i>a </i>for discharging exhaust gas produced from the reaction between the reaction gas fed into the chamber <b>21</b> and the wafer <b>3</b> is provided on a sidewall of the chamber <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The plasma etching apparatus <b>20</b> is employed as follows. First, the interior of the chamber <b>21</b> is kept high-temperature and low-pressure, and the wafer <b>3</b> is held on the chuck <b>24</b>. Subsequently, the reaction gas is fed to the interior of the chamber <b>21</b>. Additionally, the high-frequency voltage is applied to the antenna <b>22</b>, and the bias voltage to the chuck <b>24</b>, to generate plasma within the chamber <b>21</b>. In the plasma, the reaction gas is converted into active species including radicals and ions, which are accelerated toward the wafer <b>3</b> by the bias voltage. As a result, the radicals and ions in the plasma react with the wafer <b>3</b>, and thus dry etching progresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b>, first bias power (high bias) is applied to the chuck, and meanwhile the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> is subjected to the first dry-etching, <b>24</b> employing a halogen-containing gas. Examples of halogens contained in the reaction gas include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">Second Dry-Etching Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Subsequent to the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b>, a second dry etching step (low bias) S<b>11</b> is carried out. In the second dry-etching step S<b>11</b>, second bias power (low bias) lower than the first bias power is applied to the chuck <b>24</b>, and meanwhile the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> is subjected to the second dry-etching, employing as reaction gas a halogen-containing gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Examples of the reaction gas employed in the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b> and second dry-etching step S<b>11</b> include gaseous fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>), gaseous chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), gaseous iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), gaseous boron trichloride (BCl<sub>3</sub>), and a gaseous mixture (BCl<sub>3</sub>+CF<sub>4</sub>) of gaseous boron trichloride (BCl<sub>3</sub>) and gaseous carbon tetrafluoride (CF<sub>4</sub>). The types of reaction gases employed in the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b> and in the second dry-etching step S<b>11</b> may be the same as, or be different from, each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In dry etching, more than one wafer <b>3</b> can be processed simultaneously. When the wafer <b>3</b> is arranged in the plasma etching apparatus <b>20</b>, from within the atmosphere it is introduced into a vacuum processing chamber. A tray made of, for example, Al, for housing the wafer <b>3</b> can be employed in order to arrange, transport, and process the wafer. The tray is preferably resistant to the halogen-containing gases. Examples of such a tray include an Al tray coated with alumina and other ceramics, a tray made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>grass such as quarts, a tray made of polycrystalline silicon, silicon nitride, silicon carbide and other Si-base materials, a tray made of carbon composite, diamond and other C-base materials, a boron nitride tray, and a tungsten carbide tray. The diamond tray, due to its high thermal conductivity, can lessen the influence of temperature rise during dry etching. Therefore, the wafer <b>3</b> can be stably dry-etched. Trays made of Si-based material are also preferable because they have high thermal conductivity and relatively high durability, are inexpensive, and have fewer mixed-in impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">Second Cleaning Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Next, the wafer surface is cleaned (a second cleaning step S<b>13</b>). The second cleaning step S<b>13</b> may be a similar step to the first cleaning step S<b>7</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> is manufactured in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">As described above, in the III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method involving the embodiments of the present invention, the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> is damaged in the mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b> and chemical polishing step S<b>5</b>. The damage can be subsequently removed by carrying out the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b> and second dry-etching step S<b>11</b> following the first cleaning step S<b>7</b>. Furthermore, the fact that bias power in the second dry-etching is lower than that in the first dry-etching makes the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface less likely to be damaged by the second dry-etching itself. The PL intensity of the manufactured substrate <b>10</b> therefore can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Moreover, in the mechanical polishing step S<b>3</b> and chemical polishing step S<b>5</b>, the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> is preferably polished until arithmetic-mean roughness of the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> decreases to 50 Å or less. Performing polishing in this manner makes arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra<sub>2</sub>) after the second dry-etching step S<b>11</b> smaller than arithmetic-mean roughness (Ra<sub>1</sub>) before the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b>. For this reason, planarity of the surface of the manufactured substrate <b>10</b> can be heightened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Furthermore, in the wafer <b>3</b> whose surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>has elemental III-substance face and N face, carrying out the first dry-etching step S<b>9</b> and second dry-etching step S<b>11</b> lessens the difference in height between the elemental III-substance face and the N face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In addition, it is preferable that: the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b> has a elemental III-substance face and a N face; the polishing process includes the chemical polishing step S<b>5</b>; and as at least one of a chemical solution employed in the chemical polishing process S<b>5</b> and a cleaning solution employed in the first cleaning step S<b>7</b>, a solution containing at least one of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and hydrofluoric acid is utilized. Employing such a liquid prevents the elemental V-substance face (for example, N face) from being etched selectively relative to the elemental III-substance face by at least one of the chemical solution and cleaning solution in at least one of the chemical polishing process S<b>5</b> and first cleaning step S<b>7</b>. Preventing this selective etching keeps the difference in height between the elemental III-substance face and the elemental V-substance face from increasing, meaning that the planarity of the surface of the manufactured substrate <b>10</b> can be heightened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Moreover, the wafer <b>3</b> preferably contains as the elemental III substance at least one of Ga, In, and Al, and contains as the elemental V substance at least one of As, P, and N. In such a wafer <b>3</b>, the atomic weights of the elemental III substance and the elemental V substance are comparatively small, which facilitates polishing and dry-etching the surface <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the wafer <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In the foregoing, an explanation has been made of preferable modes for embodying the present invention, but the present invention is not limited to them. For example, in the polishing step, the chemical polishing process S<b>5</b> may not be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">While the following explains the present invention more specifically on the basis of embodiments and comparative examples, the present invention is not limited the following embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">First, the inventors of the present invention conducted the following Experiments 1 through 3.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Specular-polished GaAs substrates 2 inches in diameter and specular-polished GaN substrates 2 inches in diameter were prepared. Additionally, as trays for housing the substrates while they were etched, Al trays, quartz trays, silicon carbide trays, polycrystalline Si trays, and polycrystalline Si trays coated with polycrystalline diamond (diamond trays hereinafter) were prepared. In each of the five types of trays, three of the GaAs substrates were cleaned, and then arranged in a circle so that the centers of the GaAs substrates were spaced 8 cm from the center of each tray. In the same manner, three of the GaN substrates were cleaned, and then arranged in a circle so that the centers of the GaN substrates were spaced 8 cm from the center of each of the five types of the trays.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The substrate surfaces that had been dry-etched were analyzed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES). As a result, when the Al trays were employed, a prominent Al peak was observed. Furthermore, when the Al tray after dry etching was left in the open air for one hour, and discoloration caused by tray corrosion was found. With the trays other than the Al trays, Si that is main component of the trays was not observed, and no discoloration was found even after the trays were left in the open air for one hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Moreover, planarity of the substrate surfaces that had been dry-etched was measured with a contact-type surface roughness gauge, and the in-plane flatness uniformity was calculated. The calculation of the in-plane flatness uniformity was performed for that of the three substrates which was arranged in the same position in each tray. The in-plane flatness uniformity was calculated in the following manner. First, arithmetic-mean roughness was measured in a scan field of 1 mm at a total of five points—one of which was in proximity to the substrate center point, and four of which were points 10 mm inward from the substrate outer periphery. Next, the difference between the maximum and the minimum in the measured five arithmetic-mean roughnesses in the scanning range of 1 mm totally was calculated, and the difference was defined as the in-plane flatness uniformity. As a result, it was verified that the in-plane flatness uniformities decrease in the order: (1) diamond tray; (2) silicon carbide tray; (3) Al tray; (4) polycrystalline Si tray; and (5) quartz tray. That is, the diamond tray was most high in in-plane flatness uniformity. The result demonstrates that the higher the thermal conductivity, the higher the in-plane flatness uniformity. Among the four types of trays except for the Al tray, form the perspective of durability and in-plane flatness uniformity, the diamond trays and silicon carbide trays are preferable. For this reason, silicone carbide trays, readily-available at low cost, were employed in the following experiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Above-described Experiment 3 demonstrated the advantageousness of a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method including: a polishing step of polishing the surface of platelike III-V compound semiconductor crystal; a cleaning step, subsequent to the polishing step, of cleaning the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface; and a dry-etching step, subsequent to the cleaning step, of placing the III-V compound semiconductor crystal in the silicon carbide tray to dry-etch the III-V compound semiconductor crystal surface. Such a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method improves tray durability, and enhances in-plane flatness uniformity of the substrate surface.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Because GaN substrates have polarity, the extents to which Ga face was etched and to which N face was etched were separately measured by a contact type surface roughness measuring instrument. The results are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph demonstrating the relationship between the bias power and the etching extents. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, line G<b>1</b> represents the extent to which the N face was etched per given time, and line G<b>2</b> represents the extent to which the Ga face is etched per given time. The graph indicates that at a bias power of less than 300 W, the extent to which N face is etched per given time is greater than the extent to which Ga face is etched per given time. At a bias power of less than 300 W, the action of chlorine radicals predominates. On the other hand, the graph shows that at a bias power of more than 300 W, the extent to which N face is etched for the predetermined time is smaller than the extent to which Ga face is etched for the predetermined time. At a bias power of more than 300 W, the action of chlorine ions predominates. As just described, varying the bias power makes it possible to control which of the speed at which Ga face is etched and the speed at which N face is etched is higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">As just described, Experiment 4 demonstrated the difference in height between the elemental III-substance face and the N face can be controlled by means of a III-V compound semiconductor substrate manufacturing method in which the wafer surface has an elemental III-substance face and N face, and that includes: a polishing step of polishing the wafer surface; a cleaning step, subsequent to the polishing step, of cleaning the wafer surface; and a dry etching step, subsequent to the cleaning step, of subjecting the wafer surface to dry etching employing a halogen-containing gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">GaN substrates 2 inches in diameter and AlN substrates 10 square mm were prepared. Next, with the substrates being attached to the ceramic plate, polishing was performed employing aqueous hydrogen peroxide of 10 mass percent concentration with a suede-like polishing pad, in order to remove the contaminants (for example, wax and polishing agent) and metal ions clinging to the substrate surfaces. The reason why aqueous hydrogen peroxide was selected as the chemical solution is that with aqueous hydrogen peroxide, the N face is not selectively etched (eroded), and the mild acidity of the aqueous hydrogen peroxide is less likely to damage the polishing system. The conditions under which polishing was performed are shown below.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">As demonstrated in Table IV, utilizing for the chemical polish the alkaline solutions of KOH, NaOH, NH<sub>4</sub>, and OH with a pH of 10 or more, or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>as the chemical solution, led to a tendency for the N face to be selectively etched, and for the difference in height to increase. On the other hand, utilizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HF, and HCl, did not lead increased height difference. In particular, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is preferable because it has weak corrosiveness, and thus the polishing system is unlikely to be damaged.</div>
