<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a division of application Ser. No. 11/108,906 filed on Apr. 19, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,365,363 which is based on Japanese Patent Applications No. 2004-122796 filed on Apr. 19, 2004, and No. 2004-185521 filed on Jun. 23, 2004, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a silicon carbide semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor device.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Conventionally, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. H11-266017 (which corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,534) discloses a power MOSFET as a silicon carbide semiconductor device operated in an accumulation mode. In this power MOSFET, an N<sup>−</sup> conductive type layer is disposed on a surface of a N<sup>−</sup> conductive type base region and disposed under a gate oxide film made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>so that the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type layer connects between a N<sup>+</sup> conductive type source region and a N<sup>+</sup> conductive type epitaxial layer (i.e., a N<sup>+</sup> conductive type epi-layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The silicon carbide semiconductor device having the above construction becomes an off-state when the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type layer becomes a depletion layer before a voltage is applied to the gate electrode. When the voltage is applied to the gate electrode, a channel region is formed at an interface between the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type layer and the gate insulation film. The channel region extends from the N<sup>+</sup> conductive type source region <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>to two directions of the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type drift regions. Thus, the device switches from the off-state to an on-state so that the device flows current therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Thus, the above power MOSFET is operated in an accumulation mode so that the channel is induced without reversing the conductive type of the channel formation layer. Thus, the above MOSFET is capable of enlarging channel mobility so that an on-state resistance is reduced, compared with a MOSFET operated in a reverse mode for reversing the conductive type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In the above power MOSFET having the above construction, the gate insulation film is made of an oxide film (i.e., SiO<sub>2</sub>). However, an interface state is formed between the gate insulation film and the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type layer for forming the channel in a case where the gate insulation film is composed of the oxide film. Further, the interface state is formed near a conduction band of energy space, in which an electron current flows. Therefore, the charged interface state affects current flow so that the channel mobility is reduced. Further, the on-state resistance of the power MOSFET is increased. Thus, it is confirmed that this problem is occurred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Further, in general, an eight-degree offset substrate is used in a process for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate. A film is epitaxially grown on the eight-degree offset substrate by a step growth method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">However, the eight-degree offset surface of the SiC substrate is not a stable surface. Therefore, a defect caused by polishing is easily generated when a wafer is processed. Thus, it is difficult to form homogeneous surface state in a wafer surface. Therefore, for example, a device fault is occurred at a portion of a substrate having bad surface state such as a defect caused by polishing in a MOS transistor. The MOS transistor includes a source region, a drain region, a gate oxide film, and a gate electrode formed on a surface portion of the substrate. In detail, when the defect caused by polishing is disposed on the surface of the substrate, current leakage is easily occurred at the gate oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Further, when a device is formed in the SiC substrate after epitaxial growth, for example, a crystal defect due to the defect caused by polishing on the surface of the substrate may generate in the epitaxial layer of the device (i.e., diode), so that current leakage (i.e., a PN junction leakage) is easily occurred. The device has the epitaxial layer on the substrate, in which a P conductive type region is formed, and has an anode electrode and a cathode electrode.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In view of the above-described problem, it is an object of the present invention to provide a silicon carbide semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor device, the device having small on-state resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate and a method for manufacturing the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate, the substrate having excellent surface state and excellent regularity with suppressing a defect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">To accomplish the above object, a silicon carbide semiconductor device has a gate insulation film including a high dielectric constant film. The device has a stack type channel layer contacting the gate insulation film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Thus, the high dielectric constant film is formed on the surface of the channel layer, so that the interface state is not concentrated with high density near the conduction band. Accordingly, the problem of reducing the channel mobility caused by the interface state affecting to the current flow can be solved. Thus, the channel mobility is improved. Thus, the device has small on-state resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Preferably, a stack construction of the high dielectric constant film and the oxide film formed on the surface of the high dielectric constant film provides the gate insulation film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Thus, the interface state is not concentrated with high density near the conduction band at a portion of the gate insulation film contacting the channel layer. Further, the oxide film is formed on the high dielectric constant film so that a difference ΔEc measured from an edge of an energy level Ec of the silicon carbide can become larger. Thus, an energy threshold of generation of a gate leakage current is increased, so that the gate leakage current is prevented from generating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Preferably, the semiconductor substrate is a single crystal silicon carbide substrate having the principal surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from a (0001)-Si surface. Here, semiconductor substrates having various off-set angles are prepared, and a correlation between the off-set angle and a density of defects caused by polishing is studied. It is confirmed that the polishing defects are dominantly reduced when the off-set angle is equal to or larger than 10 degrees. Further, it is confirmed that the roughness on the surface is reduced so that the semiconductor substrate having small amount of crystal defects is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Accordingly, when the surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface is used, the interface state is reduced, compared with other surfaces. The (0001)-Si surface can provide small amount of crystal defects. Thus, the influence of the interface state to the current flow is reduced. Thus, the channel mobility of the power MOSFET is further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Preferably, the semiconductor substrate is a single crystal silicon carbide substrate with the principal surface having at least two surfaces, one of which is tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from a (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is the (0001)-Si surface. The single crystal silicon carbide substrate with the one surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface and the (0001)-Si surface as the principal surface provides to reduce the interface state, compared with the single crystal silicon carbide substrate having other surface as the principal surface. Thus, the influence of the interface state to the current flow is much reduced. Thus, the channel mobility of the power MOSFET is further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Preferably, the one surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface has an area larger than an area of the (0001)-Si surface. In this case, the above influence is effectively much reduced. Further, as described in claim <b>6</b>, the one surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface is tilted toward a &lt;11-20&gt;-direction. In this case, the above influence is effectively much reduced, so that it is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">More preferably, the one surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface is a (11-2N)-surface, wherein N satisfies a relationship of 17≦N≦38. In this case, the above influence is effectively much reduced, so that it is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Further, in a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate, a principal surface of the substrate is a surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from a (0001)-Si surface. Therefore, the surface has excellent surface state and excellent regularity with suppressing a defect, compared with an eight-degree offset substrate, which is a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate having a principal surface tilted by 8 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. Thus, the surface has homogeneous and stable surface state in an area of a substrate surface so that the surface provides a semiconductor-device-to-be-formed surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Here, preferably, an angle equal to or larger than 10 degrees of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate is in a range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees. More preferably, the angle equal to or larger than 10 degrees is in a range between 13 degrees and 20 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Further, an epitaxial layer is formed on the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate. In this case, the epitaxial layer has excellent surface state, and further, generation of crystal defect can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Further, in a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate, a principal surface of the substrate is composed of two surface, one of which is a (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is a surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface. Therefore, the surface has excellent surface state and excellent regularity with suppressing a defect, compared with an eight-degree offset substrate, which is a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate having a principal surface tilted by 8 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. Thus, the surface has homogeneous and stable surface state in an area of a substrate surface so that the surface provides a semiconductor-device-to-be-formed surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">It is preferred that, regarding to an area of the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface and an area of the (0001)-Si surface, the area of the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface is larger than the area of the (0001)-Si surface in the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">It is preferred that the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface is a (11-2N)-surface, wherein the N satisfies a relationship of 17≦N≦38 in the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Further, a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate includes the steps of: a first step of preparing a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate having a principal surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from a (0001)-Si surface by a scribing method; a second step of mirror-polishing the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate; and a third step of forming an epitaxial layer on the principal surface in such a manner that the epitaxial layer is epitaxially grown on the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate.</div>

<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a normally off type N channel planer type MOSFET (i.e., a vertical type power MOSFET) according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The device is suitably used for a rectifier of an alternator or an inverter of an automotive vehicle. The construction of the planer type MOSFET is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as follows. Specifically, the device provides an insulation gate type field effect transistor for large amount of power.</div>

<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">A second embodiment of the present invention is described. In this embodiment, the construction of the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is changed, compared with the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a partially enlarged view showing a part of the gate insulation film <b>7</b> of the power MOSFET according to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">As shown in this drawing, in this embodiment, the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is composed of a stacked film, which is provided by stacking the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and the oxide film <b>7</b> <i>b</i>. Specifically, the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is formed in such a manner that the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the surface of the surface channel layer <b>5</b>, and then, the oxide film <b>7</b> <i>b </i>is formed on the surface of the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an energy band structure in the above case. As shown in this drawing, in the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a </i>formed on the surface of the surface channel layer <b>5</b> made of silicon carbide, the interface state does not concentrate near the conduction band with high density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">However, when the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is formed of only the high dielectric constant film, a gate leakage current may flow largely under the high gate voltage application at a high temperature, compared with a case where the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is made of only the oxide film. This is because the difference ΔEc between the edge Ec of the energy level of silicon carbide on the conduction band side and the energy level Ec of the high dielectric constant film becomes smaller than the difference ΔEc between the energy level Ec of silicon carbide and the energy level Ec of the oxide film. Therefore, the energy barrier is easily exceeded, so that the gate leakage current flows largely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Therefore, in this embodiment, a portion of the gate insulation film <b>7</b>, which contacts the surface channel layer <b>5</b> is composed of the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a</i>. Further, the oxide film <b>7</b> <i>b </i>is formed on the surface of the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, the interface state at the portion of the gate insulation film <b>7</b>, which contacts the surface channel layer <b>5</b>, does not concentrate near the conduction band with high density. Further, since the oxide film <b>7</b> <i>b </i>is formed on the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a</i>, the difference ΔEc from the edge of the energy level of the silicon carbide becomes higher. Thus, the energy barrier, which is necessitated for generating the gate leakage current, becomes higher; and therefore, the gate leakage current is prevented from generating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Here, the power MOSFET having the above construction can be manufactured by a method obtained by adding a well-known oxide film formation process to the manufacturing method described in the first embodiment. For example, the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a </i>made of the HfAlOx film is formed at 500° C. in O<sub>2 </sub>gas atmosphere by MO-CVD method. Then, the substrate is annealed at 700° C. Further, the oxide film <b>7</b> <i>b </i>is deposited on the surface of the high dielectric constant film <b>7</b> <i>a </i>by the CVD method. Thus, the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is formed. Further, a HfSiON film can be used as the high dielectric constant film. For example, the HfSiON film is formed by a reactive sputtering method. After that, the substrate is performed with heat treatment at a temperature between 950° C. and 1100° C. in N<sub>2 </sub>gas atmosphere so that the gate insulation film <b>7</b> is formed.</div>

Thus, the surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface is the surface tilted along with a &lt;11-20&gt;-direction, so that the interface state becomes smaller. Therefore, the channel mobility of the power MOSFET can be improved more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">When the N<sup>−</sup> conductive type semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> having the surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface is used, preferably, the surface is a (11-2N)-surface, wherein N satisfies a relationship of 17≦N≦38.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a result of measurement of a relationship between the offset angle and the density of defect caused by polishing. Here, various substrates having different offset angles are prepared. The horizontal axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> represents the offset angle of the substrate, and the vertical axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> represents the density of defect caused by polishing. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when the offset angle becomes equal to or larger than 10 degrees, the defect caused by polishing is rapidly reduced. Further, when the offset angle becomes equal to or larger than 10 degrees, the roughness of the substrate surface is reduced. Further, when the offset angle becomes equal to or larger than 13 degrees, the defect caused by polishing disappears.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">Accordingly, the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate is designed to be the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface, so that the principal surface becomes stable.

More preferably, the principal surface is designed to be the surface tilted by 13 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. By using this surface, the epitaxial growth layer having small amount of the crystal defect is formed. Specifically, when the epitaxial substrate is manufactured, the defect caused by polishing can be reduced (i.e., the roughness is reduced) so that the well-regulated surface state is formed before the epitaxial film is grown. Thus, the epitaxial film is grown under the condition that the generation of the crystal defect is limited. That is, the process yielding ratio of the device is improved (i.e., the generation ration of the chip failure in the wafer is reduced).</div>

<heading>Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">Next, a sixth embodiment is explained as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">A silicon carbide semiconductor substrate and a method for manufacturing the same are explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> is composed of at least two surface, one of which is the (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is a surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface. Here, preferably, the principal surface is composed of at least two surfaces, one of which is the (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is a-surface tilted by 10 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. More preferably, the principal surface is composed of at least two surfaces, one of which is the (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is a surface tilted by 13 degrees to 20 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. This is derived from the ground of the relationship between the density of defect caused by polishing and the angle from the (0001)-Si surface, as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the epitaxial layer <b>2</b> is formed on the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> as a single crystal. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the substrate <b>1</b> having the substrate surface, on which two surfaces of the (0001)-Si surface and the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface are formed, is prepared. The epitaxial layer <b>2</b> is grown on the substrate <b>1</b> by using the CVD equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">To obtain the substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the following process is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14F</figref>, the SiC substrate <b>601</b> such as an eight-degree offset substrate is prepared. The substrate <b>601</b> has the principal surface tilted by a predetermined angle from the (0001)-Si surface. The, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the surface of the substrate <b>601</b> is polished to be a mirror-finished surface. At this time, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a defect caused by polishing remains on the surface portion of the substrate <b>601</b> (i.e., the surface portion shown as Al in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a LTO film <b>620</b> is formed on the surface of the substrate <b>601</b>. Then, the LTO film <b>620</b> is removed so that the substrate becomes a state shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. After that, the surface of the SiC substrate <b>601</b> is cleaned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>, a Si layer <b>630</b> having a thickness of about 5 nm is deposited on the surface of the SiC substrate <b>601</b> by an evaporation method and the like. Successively, an ultra high vacuum chamber is heated so that the temperature of the SiC substrate <b>601</b> becomes constant in a range between 500° C. and 1500° C. (i.e., the temperature of the substrate <b>601</b> becomes higher). At this time, preferably, the temperature is set to be 1050° C. This temperature increasing provides a step bunching on the substrate surface, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">The detail is described as follows. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which is obtained by enlarging the substrate surface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> (i.e., a portion shown as A<b>2</b>), the eight-degree offset substrate has the surface construction shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The substrate in this state is performed with high temperature treatment, so that the step bunching is formed, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which is obtained by enlarging the substrate surface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref> (i.e., a portion shown as A<b>3</b>). Thus, the substrate surface becomes the surface construction shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Thus, the step bunching having a relationship of tan<sup>−1</sup>(b/a)≦10 degrees concerning to the (0001)-Si surface is formed. Thus, the new surface of the step bunching is tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">At this time, the area of the (0001)-Si surface and the area of the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface are determined as follows. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, it is preferred that the area of the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface is larger than the area of the (0001)-Si surface, compared with a case where the area of the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface is smaller than the area of the (0001)-Si surface, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Further, when the step bunching is formed, the surface construction is restructured so that the defect caused by polishing disappears. Thus, the surface becomes stable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>, the Si layer <b>630</b> is deposited on the substrate surface before the temperature of the substrate becomes higher. This is because the substrate surface is protected from being carbonized when the temperature of the substrate is increased in the ultra high vacuum. Although the method for depositing the Si on the surface is used, other methods such as increasing vapor pressure of silicon near the surface of a specimen by silicon flux and the like can be used. Any method can be used as long as the substrate is performed with heat treatment in vacuum and atmosphere including silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the substrate having the surface composed of two surfaces is obtained. One surface is the (0001)-Si surface and the other surface is the surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from the (0001)-Si surface. Specifically, the substrate having the well-regulated surface state is obtained before the epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Then, the vertical type power MOS transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is formed by using the substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. Or, the MOS transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is formed by using the substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. Preferably, the substrate <b>601</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is made of 4H or 6H single crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">Thus, this embodiment has the following characteristics.</div>

Thus, the surface has excellent surface state and excellent regularity with suppressing a defect, compared with an eight-degree offset substrate, which is a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate having a principal surface tilted by 8 degrees from the (0001)-Si surface. Thus, the surface has excellent surface state. Specifically, the surface has a homogeneous and stable surface state in an area of a substrate surface so that the surface provides a semiconductor-device-to-be-formed surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Here, preferably, the angle equal to or larger than 10 degrees is in a range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">(V) As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the epitaxial layer <b>2</b> is formed on the principal surface of the silicon carbide single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> so that the epitaxial substrate is provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">(VI) As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14F</figref>, a method for manufacturing a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate includes the steps of: a first step of preparing a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate having a principal surface composed of at least two surfaces, one of which is a surface tilted by 10 degrees or more from a (0001)-Si surface, and the other one of which is the (0001)-Si surface, wherein two surfaces are formed in such a manner that the mirror-polished silicon carbide semiconductor substrate <b>601</b> is performed with heat treatment in vacuum and atmosphere including silicon so that two surfaces are formed on the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate <b>601</b> by a step bunching method; and a second step of forming an epitaxial layer <b>2</b> on the principal surface in such a manner that the epitaxial layer <b>2</b> is epitaxially grown on the principal surface of the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. Thus, the silicon carbide semiconductor substrate described in (V) is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">Here, preferably, the angle equal to or larger than 10 degrees is in a range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In the sixth embodiment described above, although the mirror-finished silicon carbide semiconductor substrate is processed with heat treatment in the vacuum and atmosphere including silicon, instead, the mirror-finished silicon carbide semiconductor substrate can be processed with heat treatment in the vacuum, hydrogen atmosphere and hydrogen chloride atmosphere.
