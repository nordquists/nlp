<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">Semiconductors with the ability to operate more efficiently in order to achieve a significant reduction in power consumption are highly desirable. Typically, silicon substrates are used in the manufacture of such devices; however, further development is limited due to the inherent characteristics of silicon. Development of the next generation of semiconductor devices has emphasized the use of materials having a greater hardness and other unique properties. For example, silicon carbide, when compared with silicon oxide, has a higher thermal conductivity, a greater tolerance for radiation, and a higher dielectric strength, and is able to withstand greater temperatures, which makes it suitable for a variety of applications. The use of silicon carbide has been limited to some extent by semiconductor fabrication technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">In order to produce silicon carbide semiconductors, the surfaces of the silicon carbide substrates must be polished in order to provide smooth surfaces and to obtain precise dimensions for the surfaces. The properties which make silicon carbide such a useful substrate provide unique challenges in the polishing process. Due to the hardness of silicon carbide, diamond grit is typically used to mechanically polish silicon carbide substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques are widely used throughout the semiconductor industry in order to polish the current generation of silicon devices. CMP involves the use of a polishing composition (also known as a polishing slurry) containing an abrasive and an aqueous material, which is applied to a surface by contacting the surface with a polishing pad saturated with the polishing composition. The polishing composition may also contain an oxidizing agent, which allows for less aggressive mechanical abrasion of the substrate, thus reducing mechanical damage to the substrate caused by the abrading process. The use of such techniques to polish silicon carbide substrates could greatly reduce the costs of manufacturing semiconductors by decreasing polish time and reducing damage to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Adaptation of CMP techniques for silicon carbide polishing has been relatively unsuccessful. Polishing compositions containing colloidal silica resulted in low silicon carbide removal rates, thus requiring a lengthy polishing cycle lasting several hours at temperatures of around 50Â° C., which is likely to result in damage to the silicon carbide substrate. Zhou, et al., <i>J. Electrochemical Soc., </i>144: L161-L163 (1997); Neslen, et al., <i>J. Electronic Materials, </i>30: 1271-1275 (2001). The long polishing cycle adds considerable cost to the process and is a barrier preventing widespread use of silicon carbide within the semiconductor industry. Thus, there remains a need for alternative polishing systems and methods of polishing substrates comprising silicon carbide.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The invention provides a method of chemically-mechanically polishing a substrate comprising (i) providing a substrate comprising at least one layer of single crystal silicon carbide, (ii) contacting the substrate with a chemical-mechanical polishing composition comprising (a) a liquid carrier, (b) an abrasive, (c) a catalyst comprising a metal composition, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of transition metals, and (d) an oxidizing agent that oxidizes silicon carbide, (iii) moving the composition relative to the substrate, and (iv) abrading at least a portion of the silicon carbide of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The invention is directed to a method of polishing a substrate containing at least one layer of single crystal silicon carbide. The substrate comprising at least one layer of single crystal silicon carbide is contacted with a chemical-mechanical polishing composition. The chemical-mechanical polishing composition comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of (a) a liquid carrier, (b) an abrasive, (c) a catalyst comprising a metal composition, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of transition metals, and (d) an oxidizing agent that oxidizes silicon carbide. At least a portion of the silicon carbide then is abraded to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The substrate to be polished using the method of the invention can be any suitable substrate which comprises at least one layer of silicon carbide. Suitable substrates include, but are not limited to, flat panel displays, integrated circuits, memory or rigid disks, metals, interlayer dielectric (ILD) devices, semiconductors, micro-electro-mechanical systems, ferroelectrics, and magnetic heads. The silicon carbide can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any suitable silicon carbide, many of which are known in the art. The silicon carbide can be single crystal. Silicon carbide has many different types of crystal structures, each having its own distinct set of electronic properties. Only a small number of these polytypes, however, can be reproduced in a form acceptable for use as semiconductors. Such polytypes can be either cubic (e.g., 3C silicon carbide) or non-cubic (e.g., 4H silicon carbide, 6H silicon carbide). The properties of these polytypes are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The abrasive can be any suitable abrasive, many of which are well known in the art. The abrasive can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of one or more metal oxides. The metal oxide can be selected from the group consisting of alumina, ceria, germania, magnesia, silica, titania, zirconia, co-formed products thereof, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The abrasive preferably comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of alumina. For example, the alumina can be seeded gel process alpha alumina, which is available from manufacturers such as Saint Gobain (alpha alumina).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The abrasive desirably is suspended in the liquid carrier (e.g., water). The abrasive typically is in particulate form. The abrasive particles can have any suitable particle size. The abrasive particles can have an average particle size of about 10 nm or more, about 20 nm or more, about 30 nm or more, about 40 nm or more, or about 50 nm or more. Alternatively, or in addition, the abrasive particles can have an average particle size of about 500 or less, about 200 nm or less, about 180 nm or less, about 170 nm or less, about 160 nm or less, about 150 nm or less, about 130 nm or less, about 110 nm or less, or about 100 nm or less. For example, the abrasive particles can have an average particle size of about 40 nm to about 130 nm, about 45 nm to about 125 nm, about 50 nm to about 120 nm, about 55 nm to about 115 nm, or about 60 nm to about 110 nm. The particle size of a particle is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encompasses the particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Any suitable amount of abrasive can be present in the polishing composition. The amount of abrasive in the polishing composition can be about 0.01 wt. % or more, about 0.05 wt. % or more, about 0.1 wt. % or more, about 0.2 wt. % or more, about 0.3 wt. % or more, about 0.5 wt. % or more, about 1 wt. % or more, about 5 wt. % or more, about 7 wt. % or more, about 10 wt. % or more, or about 12 wt. % or more. Alternatively, or in addition, the amount of abrasive in the polishing composition can be about 50 wt. % or less, about 40 wt. % or less, about 15 wt. % or less, about 10 wt. % or less, about 5 wt. % or less, about 3 wt. % or less, about 1 wt. % or less, about 0.8 wt. % or less, about 0.7 wt. % or less, about 0.6 wt. % or less, or about 0.5 wt. % or less. For example, the amount of abrasive in the polishing composition can be about 0.05 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, about 0.1 wt. % to about 0.8 wt. %, or about 0.5 wt. % to about 0.7 wt. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">A liquid carrier is used to facilitate the application of the abrasive and any optional additives to the surface of a suitable substrate to be polished (e.g., planarized). The liquid carrier can be any suitable liquid, e.g., solvent, including lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc.), ethers (e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.), water, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the liquid carrier comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of water, more preferably deionized water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of approach to equilibrium of a chemical reaction without being substantially consumed itself. Advantageously, a catalyst can be present in less than stoichiometric amounts. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the catalyst in conjunction with the oxidizing agent promotes the oxidation of silicon carbide to silicon dioxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The catalyst comprises a metal composition, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of transition group metals. The metal composition typically is a transition metal salt or complex having two or more oxidation states. The phrase âtwo or more oxidation statesâ refers to an atom and/or compound that has a valence number that is capable of being augmented as the result of a loss of one or more negative charges in the form of electrons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The metal composition advantageously comprises a transition metal chosen from the group comprising Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Mn, Nb, Ni, Os, Pd, Ru, Ir, Re Rh, Sn, Ti, V, Zr and combinations thereof. Preferably, the transition metal is Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Ag, Pd, Pt, or Rh. More preferably, the transition metal is Pt or Co.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The metal composition typically comprises an anion or ligand in addition to the transition metal. The anion and ligand can be any suitable anion and any suitable ligand, respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The catalyst can be homogeneous or heterogenous. The metal composition is advantageously at least partially soluble in the liquid carrier under the conditions under which the polishing is carried out, or are carried by, absorbed onto, or attached to an inert support such as, for example, silica or alumina. By âat least partially solubleâ is meant that the metal composition has a solubility in the liquid carrier of at least 1 Î¼g/mL or more, i.e., at least 1 Î¼g of metal composition dissolves completely in 1 mL of liquid carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The catalyst comprising a metal composition can be present in the polishing composition in any suitable amount. The polishing composition can comprise about 5 ppm or more, 50 ppm or more, 100 ppm or more, about 250 ppm or more, about 500 ppm or more, about 1000 ppm or more, about 1500 ppm or more, about 2000 ppm or more, about 2500 ppm or more, or about 3000 ppm or more catalyst.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The polishing composition employs an oxidizing agent in conjunction with a catalyst. The oxidizing agent can be any suitable oxidizing agent that oxidizes silicon carbide. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, oxone, ammonium cerium nitrate, periodates, iodates, persulfates, chlorates, chromates, permanganates, bromates, perbromates, ferrates, perrhenates, perruthenates, and mixtures thereof. The permanganates, periodiates, and persulfates can be any periodate, iodate, persulfate or combination of periodates, iodates, and persulfates, such as, for example, potassium periodate, periodic acid, ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, or potassium permanganate. More preferably, the oxidizing agent is potassium persulfate, potassium permanganate, or periodic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The oxidizing agent can be present in the polishing composition in any suitable amount. The polishing composition can comprise about 0.001 wt. % or more, about 0.005 wt. % or more, about 0.01 wt. % or more, about 0.05 wt. % or more, about 0.1 wt. % or more, or about 0.2 wt. % or more oxidizing agent.

For example, the polishing composition can comprise about 0.01 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, about 0.05 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, about 0.1 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. %, or about 0.2 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The polishing composition, specifically the liquid carrier with any components dissolved or suspended therein, can have any suitable pH. The actual pH of the polishing composition will depend, in part, on the type of substrate being polished. The polishing composition can have a pH of about 11 or less, about 9 or less, about 7 or less, about 6 or less, about 5 or less, about 4 or less, about 3 or less, or about 2 or less. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can have a pH of about 1 or more, about 2 or more, about 3 or more, about 4 or more, about 6 or more, about 8 or more, or about 9 or more. For example, the pH can be from about 1 to about 11, from about 2 to about 10, from about 2 to about 6, from about 3 to about 9, from about 4 to about 8, from about 5 to about 7, or from about 3 to about 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The pH of the polishing composition can be achieved and/or maintained by any suitable means. More specifically, the polishing composition can further comprise a pH adjustor, a pH buffering agent, or a combination thereof. The pH adjustor can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any suitable pH-adjusting compound. For example, the pH adjustor can be any suitable acid, such as an inorganic or an organic acid, or combination thereof. For example, the acid can be nitric acid. The pH buffering agent can be any suitable buffering agent, for example, phosphates, acetates, borates, sulfonates, carboxylates, and the like. The polishing composition can comprise any suitable amount of a pH adjustor and/or a pH buffering agent, provided such amount is sufficient to achieve and/or maintain the desired pH of the polishing composition, e.g., within the ranges set forth herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">It will be appreciated that many of the aforementioned compounds can exist in the form of a salt, an acid, or as a partial salt. Furthermore, certain compounds or reagents may perform more than one function. For example, some compounds can function both as a chelating agent and an oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The polishing composition can comprise a surfactant and/or rheological control agent, including viscosity enhancing agents and coagulants (e.g., polymeric rheological control agents, such as, for example, urethane polymers). Suitable surfactants can include, for example, cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, mixtures thereof, and the like. The amount of surfactant in the polishing composition typically is about 0.0001 wt. % to about 1 wt. % (preferably about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.1 wt. % and more preferably about 0.005 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. %).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The polishing composition can comprise an antifoaming agent. The antifoaming agent can be any suitable anti-foaming agent. Suitable antifoaming agents include, but are not limited to, silicon-based and acetylenic diol-based antifoaming agents. The amount of anti-foaming agent in the polishing composition typically is about 10 ppm to about 140 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The polishing composition can comprise a biocide. The biocide can be any suitable biocide, for example, an isothiazolinone biocide. The amount of biocide in the polishing composition typically is about 1 to about 500 ppm, preferably about 2 to about 20 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The polishing composition can be prepared by any suitable technique, many of which are known to those skilled in the art. The polishing composition can be prepared in a batch or continuous process. Generally, the polishing composition can be prepared by combining the components thereof in any order. The term âcomponentâ as used herein includes individual ingredients (e.g., oxidizing agent, abrasive, etc.) as well as any combination of ingredients (e.g., water, catalyst, surfactant, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The polishing composition can be supplied as a one-package system comprising the liquid carrier, the abrasive, the oxidizing agent, and optionally other additives. Alternatively, some of the components, such as an oxidizing agent, can be supplied in a first container, either in dry form, or as a solution or dispersion in the liquid carrier, and the remaining components, such as the abrasive and other additives, can be supplied in a second container or multiple other containers. Other two-container, or three- or more container combinations of the components of the polishing composition are within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Solid components, such as the abrasive, can be placed in one or more containers either in dry form or as a solution in the liquid carrier. Moreover, it is suitable for the components in the first, second, or other containers to have different pH values, or alternatively to have substantially similar, or even equal, pH values. The components of the polishing composition can be partially or entirely supplied separately from each other and can be combined, e.g., by the end-user, shortly before use (e.g., 1 week or less prior to use, 1 day or less prior to use, 1 hour or less prior to use, 10 minutes or less prior to use, or 1 minute or less prior to use).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The polishing composition also can be provided as a concentrate which is intended to be diluted with an appropriate amount of liquid carrier prior to use. In such an embodiment, the polishing composition concentrate can comprise a liquid carrier and optionally other components in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with an appropriate amount of liquid carrier, each component will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the appropriate range recited above for each component. For example, each component can be present in the concentrate in an amount that is about 2 times (e.g., about 3 times, about 4 times, about 5 times, or at least about 10 times) greater than the concentration recited above for each component in the polishing composition so that, when the concentrate is diluted with an appropriate volume of liquid carrier (e.g., an equal volume of liquid carrier, 2 equal volumes of liquid carrier, 3 equal volumes of liquid carrier, or 4 equal volumes of liquid carrier, respectively), each component will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the ranges set forth above for each component. Furthermore, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the concentrate can contain an appropriate fraction of the liquid carrier present in the final polishing composition in order to ensure that the other components of the polishing composition are at least partially or fully dissolved or suspended in the concentrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The inventive method of polishing a substrate is particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus. Typically, the apparatus comprises a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving with the platen when in motion, and a carrier that holds a substrate to be polished by contacting and moving relative to the surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with the polishing pad and the polishing composition (which generally is disposed between the substrate and the polishing pad), with the polishing pad moving relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Desirably, the polishing end-point is determined by monitoring the weight of the silicon carbide substrate, which is used to compute the amount of silicon carbide removed from the substrate. Polishing end-point determination techniques are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Polishing refers to the removal of at least a portion of a surface to polish the surface. Polishing can be performed to provide a surface having reduced surface roughness by removing gouges, crates, pits, and the like (i.e., to planarize the surface), but polishing also can be performed to introduce or restore a surface geometry characterized by an intersection of planar segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The method of the invention can be used to polish any suitable substrate comprising at least one layer of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide can be removed at any suitable rate to effect polishing of the substrate. For example, silicon carbide can be removed at a rate of about 50 nm/hr or more, about 70 nm/hr or more, about 100 nm/hr or more, about 200 nm/hr or more, about 500 nm/hr or more, about 1000 nm/hr or more, or about 2000 nm/hr or more.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">This example demonstrates the effect on the removal rate of silicon carbide by the presence of different transition metal compositions in the polishing composition of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">An on-axis 4HPSI single crystal silicon carbide wafer was polished with 11 different polishing compositions. Each of the polishing compositions contained water, 0.6 wt. % seeded gel process alpha alumina, a catalyst as indicated below, and 0.3 wt. % of potassium persulfate (KPS), and was adjusted to a pH of 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The silicon carbide removal rate (nm/hr) was determined for each polishing composition, and the results are shown in Table 1.</div>
