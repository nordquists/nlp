<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is based upon and claims benefit/priority of prior Chinese patent application No. 200910001587.7, filed Jan. 15, 2009, published as CN 101781526A the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present disclosure relates to chemical polishing solutions and chemical polishing methods using the chemical polishing solutions for gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Information</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">GaAs is an important semiconductor material, developed more recently than Ge and Si to meet performance demands in semiconducting and semi-insulating devices. In certain applications and fields, GaAs crystals perform better than Ge and Si. For example, GaAs has an electron mobility about 6 times higher and can operate at higher frequencies than Si, and is thus a good material for high-speed integrated circuits and electronic devices. Monocrystalline GaAs wafers are mainly used in microwave and mm-wave communication fields, such as mobile phone, satellite transmission broadcast, radar system and other related areas of advanced electronics. Owing to its excellent photoelectric properties, GaAs is also used extensively in laser devices and light emission diode (LED) applications. Developments in these technologies coupled with the expanding use of monocrystalline GaAs has fostered a rapid increase in demand for GaAs products of higher quality and lower cost. GaAs manufacturers have made efforts to improve product quality and reduce cost, including attempts to reduce adverse environmental impacts such as pollution stemming from chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) volatilization of wafer polishing solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In general, GaAs wafers are cut from a GaAs crystal ingot by a metal saw or a wire saw, which then undergo further processing, including grinding, chemical mechanical polishing, chemical polishing, and special cleaning before being packaged for delivery. The processed GaAs crystal wafers have smooth, mirror-like main surfaces. Consumers of these processed GaAs crystals typically add different monocrystalline layers of various thicknesses onto the surface to provide devices with different functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">During the chemical mechanical polishing and chemical polishing processes, polishing solutions are used, which are referred to as “chemical polishing solutions.” The existing chemical polishing solutions often leave the GaAs crystal wafers contaminated with metal ions. Accordingly, electrical devices prepared using these wafers may suffer a variety of drawbacks and defects such as increased leakage current, reduced service life, and failures, and the like. As such, there is a need in the art for improved chemical polishing solutions that enable creation of GaAs crystal wafers of high quality, while minimizing production costs, pollution and/or related problems.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In one implementation, the chemical polishing solution for chemical polishing of GaAs wafers, may comprise dichloroisocyanurate, sulfonate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate, excluding the solvent (aqueous solvent/water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In another implementation, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may comprise, based on weight, about 29 to about 40% dichloroisocyanurate, about 0.20 to about 0.45% sulfonate, about 18 to about 35% acid pyrophosphate, about 17 to about 24% bicarbonate, and about 15 to about 23% carbonate, by weight based on the solute, excluding aqueous solvent (water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The percentage values herein are expressed “by weight based on the solute, excluding the aqueous solvent,” meaning that the numerical values refer to the quantity of substance dissolved in the water/solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In another implementation, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may comprise about 31 to about 37% dichloroisocyanurate, about 0.28 to about 0.42% sulfonate, about 20 to about 32.3% acid pyrophosphate, about 17.5 to about 22% bicarbonate, and about 16 to about 23.00% carbonate, by weight based on the solute, excluding aqueous solvent/water.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In the disclosed chemical polishing solutions, the total percentages by weight of dichloroisocyanurate, sulfonate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate, not considering solvent/water, may be 100%. To the extent that it has no negative effects on GaAs wafers, the total percentage by weight of the chemical components (i.e. dichloroisocyanurate, sulfonate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate), after having been dissolved in solvent/water, is not limited and may be of various percentages, although values not higher than about 3%, not higher than about 2.5%, not higher than about 2%, and also not higher than about 1.8% are consistent with the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">For the purpose of preparing chemical polishing solutions, dichloroisocyanurate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate may be any one of their water-soluble salts, respectively. Further, dichloroisocyanurate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate may be any one of their water-soluble alkali metal salts or ammonium salts, respectively, and/or any one of their sodium salts or ammonium salts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In some of the disclosed chemical polishing solutions, sulfonate may be any one of water-soluble sulfonates, a water-soluble alkali metal or ammonium sulfonate, or a sodium or ammonium sulfonate. Further, sulfonate may be bisulfonate or monosulfonate of a C<sub>6-16</sub>aryl group (i.e. an aromatic group containing 6 to 16 carbon atoms, including substituted phenyl) (such as C<sub>4-10</sub>alkylbenzene sulfonate, benzene sulfonate, naphthalene sulfonate, anthracene sulfonate, C<sub>4-10</sub>alkylbenzene disulfonate bi-salt, benzene disulfonate bi-salt, naphthalene di-sulfonate bi-salt or anthracene di-sulfonate bi-salt, for example, 1,2-benzenedisulfonic bi-salt, 1,3-benzenedisulfonic bi-salt, benzene sulfonate or naphthalene sulfonate), alkyl sulfonate such as a sulfonate of an alkyl group of 4 to 10 carbon atoms, including butyl sulfonate, pentyl sulfonate, hexyl sulfonate, heptyl sulfonate, octyl sulfonate, nonyl sulfonate and decyl sulfonate) and phenolic sulfonate, or sulfonate may be 1,3-benzenedisulfonic, benzene sulfonate, naphthalene sulfonate or hexyl sulfonate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">For the preparation of the disclosed chemical polishing solutions, all of the chemical components may be directly introduced into, and dissolved in deionized water, and uniformly mixed. The chemical components may also be mixed thoroughly, introduced into and dissolved in deionized water, and uniformly mixed. Alternatively, the chemical components may be introduced, one after another, into deionized water, dissolved therein, and uniformly mixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">As shown by analysis and testing, when the disclosed chemical polishing solutions are stored in a sealed container, the chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) gas that vaporizes from the solution into the space air of the container is not higher than 55.3 ml/m<sup>3</sup>. Thus, it may be concluded that, compared with existing solutions, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may decrease the vaporizing Cl<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the air space of a container and reduce the environment pollution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Surprisingly, further analysis and test results show that the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may be used after being stored for 24 hours after their preparation without compromising their effectiveness. Accordingly, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may not require ‘on the spot’ preparation; instead, they may be prepared beforehand and stored as stock solution. Thus, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions allow for longer timeframes for their preparation and use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The disclosed chemical polishing solutions make it possible to achieve excellent polishing quality of a GaAs wafer at low concentrations. For example, based on the total weight of the chemical polishing solution, the total percentage of all the chemical components is not higher than about 1.8%. Thus, reduced amounts of the chemical components may be used, resulting in less crystallization of the chemical components in the chemical polishing solution and further contributing to reduced damages and scratches on the GaAs wafers, whereby production rates are increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Also, it is unexpectedly found that the disclosed chemical polishing solutions contribute to a substantially reduced content of contaminating metal ions on the polished wafers, and thus avoid any negative effect of the metal ions on the wafer surfaces. This facilitates enhancing the quality of the extended layers of the devices deposited on the wafers. Indeed, TXRF (x-ray reflection fluorescence test) shows that by employing the disclosed chemical polishing solutions, there is no Cu identified on the polished GaAS wafer surface. Regarding existing chemical polishing solutions, it is difficult to avoid Cu contamination on the polished wafer surface. Without being limited to any theory, it is believed that Cu present on the polished wafer surface is attributable to the colloidal silica contained in previous chemical polishing solutions as SiO<sub>2</sub>, which entrains metal ions and other impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Additional tests show that, with colloidal silica introduced into it, the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may be used in chemical-mechanical rough polishing processes, a process that may be conducted before the chemical polishing processes discussed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Consistent with the innovations herein, chemical polishing methods for performing chemical polishing of GaAs crystal wafers comprise polishing said wafer in a double-sided or single-sided chemical polishing apparatus in the presence of a chemical polishing solution comprising, excluding solvent/water, dichloroisocyanurate, sulfonate, acid pyrophosphate, bicarbonate and carbonate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In another implementation of the disclosed chemical polishing solutions, the total percentage by weight of the chemical components in water may be: not higher than about 3%, not higher than about 2.5%, not higher than about 2%, or not higher than about 1.8%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The disclosed chemical polishing solutions described herein, may be used in the chemical polishing methods for GaAs wafers. The contents of the components described in connection with the disclosed chemical polishing solutions may be combined with each other to constitute differing aspects of the chemical polishing solutions and methods, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a representative chemical polishing method may be implemented as follows. A GaAs wafer <b>3</b> to be polished is loaded into a single-sided polishing equipment. The polishing equipment includes two parts, one above the other: the lower polishing plate <b>1</b> and the polishing head <b>4</b>, with the lower polishing plate <b>1</b> lined with a polishing pad <b>2</b>. GaAs wafer <b>3</b> is placed between the polishing head <b>4</b> and the polishing pad <b>2</b>. Parts <b>1</b> and <b>4</b> are rotated by driving shafts R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. For the purpose of carrying out the polishing process, the chemical polishing solution is supplied by a pipe <b>5</b>, dripping to the polishing pad <b>2</b> through dripping holes <b>6</b>; pipe <b>5</b> includes a horizontal section that is closed at its end and provided at its lower side with several evenly distributed dripping holes <b>6</b> of desired diameter, e.g. 3 mm, etc. After being polished for a pre-determined time, the GaAs wafer is taken out from the polishing equipment, and then cleaned and dried, to provide the final product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The disclosed chemical polishing methods may be applied to any product that has undergone a chemical-mechanical rough polishing method. The chemical polishing method may be carried out after a chemical-mechanical rough polishing is performed using a different polishing solution. For example, before the disclosed chemical polishing method is carried out, a chemical-mechanical rough polishing method may first be performed. Here, such rough polishing may be carried out with a chemical-mechanical rough polishing solution formed by mixing the disclosed chemical polishing solutions with colloidal silica. Moreover, it should be noted that all such combinations of processes are encompassed within the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The disclosed chemical polishing solutions and methods may make it possible to improve wafer quality, decrease cost, and/or reduce associated environmental pollution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">For further illustration of various aspects of the present disclosure, several specific examples will now be described. It should be understood however that these examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading>Examples 1-3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The components of the chemical polishing solutions are provided according to the formulations provided in Table 1 (with numerical values based on the total weight of the chemical components). These formulations may be uniformly mixed with deionized water (with concentration being based on the total weight of the resulting solution), thus producing the chemical polishing solutions. 10 L of each fresh chemical polishing solution was stored in a 20 L sealed container for 24 hours. The Cl<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the air space of each container may be measured using a chlorine-methyl orange spectrophotometric method. The results for the three solutions show that Cl<sub>2 </sub>vaporizes into the air space in each container is less than 55.3 ml/m<sup>3 </sup>(calculated as under a normal condition). These values confirm that the disclosed chemical polishing solutions are stable and may be used within 24 hours after their preparation without negative effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The disclosed chemical polishing solutions formulated within 24 hours may be used to carry out the chemical polishing of 150.04 mm (6 inch) diameter, 710 μm thick GaAs wafers in the single-sided polishing equipment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The wafers are loaded as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, 4 pieces in a batch, and undergo chemical polishing for 6 minutes, with the lower polishing plate and the polishing head rotating in the same direction at 30 rpm. The wafers are taken out, cleaned with deionized water, dried, and subjected to further measurement.</div>
