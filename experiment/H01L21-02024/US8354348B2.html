<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">One of technical fields of the invention to be disclosed relates to a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. In addition, the invention to be disclosed relates to a method for manufacturing a reprocessed semiconductor substrate with the use of the method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, and relates to a method for manufacturing an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">In recent years, integrated circuits using an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate that includes a thin single crystal silicon layer formed on an insulating surface have been developed instead of those using a bulk silicon wafer. The characteristics of the thin single crystal silicon layer formed on the insulating surface make it possible to completely separate transistors formed in the integrated circuit from each other. Further, since fully-depleted transistors can be formed, a semiconductor integrated circuit with high added values such as high integration, high speed driving, and low power consumption can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">As a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, a hydrogen ion implantation separation method is known. The hydrogen ion implantation separation method is a method by which a single crystal silicon layer is obtained in the following manner: a single crystal silicon substrate (a bond substrate) into which hydrogen ions are implanted is bonded to another substrate (a base substrate) with an insulating layer interposed between the substrates, and then the single crystal silicon substrate (the bond substrate) is separated along an ion implantation region by heat treatment. With the above hydrogen ion implantation separation method, an SOI substrate in which a single crystal silicon layer is provided over an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate can be manufactured (see Patent Document 1 as an example).</div>

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">When a hydrogen ion implantation separation method is employed as a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, a plurality of SOI substrates can be manufactured from one bond substrate; therefore, there is an advantage that cost for the bond substrate in manufacturing an SOI substrate can be reduced. This is because, when the bond substrate from which a single crystal silicon layer is separated is subjected to reprocessing treatment, the used bond substrate can be reused for manufacturing another SOI substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Here, a peripheral portion of the bond substrate such as a single crystal silicon substrate, which is used for the above hydrogen ion implantation separation method, has a region called an edge roll off (E. R. O.) that is caused by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) treatment during manufacture of the bond substrate. This region is formed when an edge of the bond substrate is polished with a polishing cloth. The edge roll off region of the bond substrate has a curved surface and a thickness smaller than that in a central region of the bond substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">When an SOI substrate is manufactured by the ion implantation separation method, a bond substrate and a base substrate are bonded to each other by a mechanism of intermolecular force or the Van der Waals force; therefore, surfaces to be bonded need to have a predetermined degree of planarity. It is natural that the bond substrate and the base substrate be not bonded in the edge roll off region where the surface planarity is not secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Thus, in a region of the bond substrate from which the single crystal silicon layer is separated, which corresponds to the above edge roll off region, an unseparated single crystal silicon region and an insulating layer are left as a projection. This projection becomes a problem in a stage of reprocessing treatment of the bond substrate. The difference in height between the projection and the other region (a region where the bonding is performed properly) is several hundred nanometers at most. However, in order to remove the projection by polishing a surface by a CMP method so that the reprocessed substrate can be used for manufacturing an SOI substrate again as a bond substrate, a semiconductor needs to be removed by approximately 10 Î¼m, and thus a sufficient number of times of reprocessing and use of the bond substrate cannot be secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In view of the foregoing problem, an object of an embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is to provide a method suitable for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. Another object of an embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is to manufacture a reprocessed semiconductor substrate with the use of the method suitable for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate. Still another object of an embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is to manufacture an SOI substrate with the use of the reprocessed semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In an embodiment of the invention to be disclosed, a projection is removed using a method by which a semiconductor region damaged due to addition of ions or the like can be selectively removed. Further, the above method is used to manufacture a reprocessed semiconductor substrate, and an SOI substrate is manufactured using the reprocessed semiconductor substrate. Detailed description is made below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">An embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, including the steps of: performing etching treatment on a semiconductor substrate which has a projection including a damaged semiconductor region and an insulating layer in a peripheral portion, whereby the insulating layer is removed; and performing etching treatment of the semiconductor substrate with the use of a mixed solution which includes a substance that oxidizes a semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate, a substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, whereby the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed with a non-damaged semiconductor region left.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Another embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, including the steps of: performing etching treatment on a semiconductor substrate in which a projection including a damaged semiconductor region and an insulating layer is left in a peripheral portion after part of the semiconductor substrate is separated as a semiconductor layer through ion irradiation and heat treatment, whereby the insulating layer is removed; and performing etching treatment of the semiconductor substrate with the use of a mixed solution which includes a substance that oxidizes a semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate, a substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, whereby the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed with a non-damaged semiconductor region left.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Still another embodiment of the invention to be disclosed is a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate, including the steps of: performing etching treatment on a semiconductor substrate in which a projection including a damaged semiconductor region and an insulating layer is left in a peripheral portion and in which a damaged semiconductor region which is thinner than the damaged semiconductor region in the peripheral portion is left in the other region after part of the semiconductor substrate is separated as a semiconductor layer through ion irradiation and heat treatment, whereby the insulating layer is removed; and performing etching treatment of the semiconductor substrate with the use of a mixed solution which includes a substance that oxidizes a semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate, a substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, whereby the damaged semiconductor regions are selectively removed with a non-damaged semiconductor region left.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In the above methods, the ion irradiation is preferably performed without mass separation. Further, the ions preferably include an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In the etching treatment by which the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed, etching selectivity of the damaged semiconductor region to the non-damaged semiconductor region is preferably 2 or higher. Further, it is preferable that the etching treatment by which the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed be stopped after etching selectivity of the projection to the other region is reduced to lower than 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In addition, at least a region where an angle between a tangent plane of the projection and a back surface of the semiconductor substrate is 0.5Â° or less is preferably removed by the etching treatment. Further, a surface of the semiconductor substrate is preferably polished after the etching treatment by which the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In the above methods, it is preferable that nitric acid be used as the substance that oxidizes the semiconductor material included in the semiconductor substrate, hydrofluoric acid be used as the substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and acetic acid be used as the substance that controls the speed of oxidization of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">By the above methods, a reprocessed semiconductor substrate can be manufactured from the semiconductor substrate. Furthermore, an SOI substrate can be manufactured in the following manner: ions are added to the reprocessed semiconductor substrate manufactured by any of the above methods so that an embrittlement region is formed, the reprocessed semiconductor substrate and a base substrate are bonded with an insulating layer interposed therebetween, and the reprocessed semiconductor substrate is separated by heat treatment so that a semiconductor layer is formed over the base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Note that in this specification and the like, an SOI substrate refers to a substrate in which a semiconductor layer is formed on an insulating surface, and is not limited to a structure where a silicon layer is provided on an insulating layer. For example, an SOI substrate may have a structure where a silicon layer is directly formed on a glass substrate, a structure where a silicon carbide layer is formed on an insulating layer, or the like.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Embodiments and examples will be described below with reference to the drawings. Note that the invention can be implemented in many different modes, and it is clear to those skilled in the art that the modes and details can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention should not be construed as being limited to the description of the embodiments and examples. Note that the same portions or portions having a similar function are denoted by the same reference numerals in this specification and the like, and explanation thereof is omitted in some cases.</div>
<heading>Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In this embodiment, a method for reprocessing a semiconductor substrate will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">&lt;Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an example of a structure of a semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> before reprocessing treatment (a semiconductor substrate from which a semiconductor layer is separated). A projection <b>126</b> exists in a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>. The projection <b>126</b> includes an insulating layer <b>123</b>, an unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b>, and a semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added. Note that both the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added are damaged and include many crystal defects, voids, or the like, due to adding treatment of ions or the like in a manufacturing process of an SOI substrate. Therefore, the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added can be collectively referred to as a damaged semiconductor region. The damaged semiconductor region refers to a region part of which includes disorder of alignment of atoms in a crystal (a crystal structure), a crystal defect, a distortion of a crystal lattice, or the like, which is caused by addition of ions or the like, while a single crystal semiconductor region is a region in which atoms in a crystal are aligned in a spatially regular manner. In addition, a non-damaged semiconductor region refers to a single crystal semiconductor region in which atoms in a crystal are aligned in a spatially aligned manner and which has the same quality as a single crystal semiconductor region to which ions and the like are not added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The above projection <b>126</b> includes a so-called edge roll off (E. R. O.) region of the semiconductor substrate. The edge roll off region is caused by surface treatment (CMP treatment) of the semiconductor substrate. Since the thickness in the edge roll off region of the semiconductor substrate is smaller than that in a central region of the semiconductor substrate, bonding is not performed in the edge roll off region in manufacturing an SOI substrate. As a result, the projection <b>126</b> is left in the edge roll off region of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Note that a semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added exists in a region of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>, other than the projection <b>126</b>, (especially in a region surrounded by the above edge roll off region). The semiconductor region <b>129</b> is formed in such a manner that a region to which ions are added, which is formed in the manufacturing process of the SOI substrate, is left in the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> after the semiconductor layer is separated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Here, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> is thin enough as compared to the semiconductor regions (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b>) in the projection <b>126</b>. Further, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> is damaged by adding treatment of ions or the like and includes many crystal defects or the like. Therefore, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> as well as the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> can be referred to as a damaged semiconductor region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">&lt;Projection of Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a schematic view in which the projection <b>126</b> is enlarged. The projection <b>126</b> includes a region corresponding to the edge roll off region and a region corresponding to a chamfer portion. In this embodiment, the edge roll off region refers to a set of points at which an angle Î¸ between a tangent plane of a surface of the projection <b>126</b> and a reference surface is 0.5Â° or less. Here, as the reference surface, a plane parallel to a front surface or a back surface of the semiconductor substrate is employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Alternatively, by setting a region of approximately 0.2 mm from the end of the substrate as the chamfer portion, the edge roll off region can be defined as a region which is inside the chamfer portion and in which bonding is not performed. Specifically, for example, a region of approximately 0.2 mm to 0.9 mm from the end of the substrate can be referred to as the edge roll off region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Note that the chamfer portion does not affect the bonding between a base substrate and a bond substrate; therefore, the planarity of the chamfer portion does not matter in reprocessing treatment of the substrate. On the other hand, the vicinity of the edge roll off region has an influence on the bonding between the base substrate and the bond substrate. Therefore, depending on the planarity of the edge roll off region, a reprocessed semiconductor substrate cannot be used in a manufacturing process of an SOI substrate in some cases. For this reason, it is very important to remove the projection <b>126</b> in the edge roll off region so that the planarity thereof is improved in the reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">&lt;Reprocessing Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate includes at least two etching treatments, etching treatment (hereinafter referred to as first etching treatment) for removing the insulating layer <b>123</b> and etching treatment (hereinafter referred to as second etching treatment) for removing the damaged semiconductor region. These are described in detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0012">&lt;First Etching Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">First, the first etching treatment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. As described above, the first etching treatment is etching treatment for removing the insulating layer <b>123</b> from the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>. Here, the insulating layer <b>123</b> can be removed by wet etching treatment using a solution containing hydrofluoric acid as an etchant. As the solution containing hydrofluoric acid, a mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, ammonium fluoride, and a surfactant (e.g., product name: LAL 500, produced by Stella Chemifa Corporation) or the like is preferably used. This wet etching treatment is preferably performed for 120 seconds to 1200 seconds, for example, approximately 600 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Since wet etching treatment can be performed in such a manner that the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is soaked in a solution in a treatment tank, a plurality of semiconductor substrates <b>121</b> can be processed at one time. Accordingly, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment can be increased. Further, since the insulating layer <b>123</b> is removed by the first etching treatment and does not need to be removed by the second etching treatment, the etching time can be shortened. Furthermore, since the semiconductor is hardly etched by the first etching treatment, the amount of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> removed by the etching can be reduced and the number of times of reprocessing can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">By the first etching treatment, the insulating layer <b>123</b> needs to be removed, and dry etching treatment may be employed. Alternatively, wet etching treatment and dry etching treatment may be used in combination. For the dry etching treatment, a parallel plate reactive ion etching (RIE) method, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0013">&lt;Second Etching Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Next, the second etching treatment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. In the second etching treatment, the damaged semiconductor regions, that is, the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added, which are included in the projection <b>126</b>, and the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added, are selectively removed. More specifically, wet etching treatment is performed using, as an etchant, a mixed solution which includes a substance that oxidizes a semiconductor material, a substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and a substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material. This etching treatment is preferably performed for approximately 1 minute to 10 minutes, for example, approximately 2 minutes to 4 minutes. In addition, the temperature of the mixed solution is preferably set at approximately 10Â° C. to 30Â° C., for example, 25Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In the above treatment, nitric acid is preferably used for a chemical solution including the substance that oxidizes the semiconductor material. Hydrofluoric acid is preferably used for a chemical solution including the substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material. Acetic acid is preferably used for a chemical solution including the substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material. The composition of the etchant is preferably set as follows: the volume of 70 weight % nitric acid is more than 0.01 times and less than one time as large as that of 97.7 weight % acetic acid and is more than 0.1 times and less than 100 times as large as that of 50 weight % hydrofluoric acid, and the volume of 50 weight % hydrofluoric acid is more than 0.01 times and less than 0.5 times as large as that of 97.7 weight % acetic acid. For example, it is preferable that the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid be 1:3:10, 1:2:10, 1.5:3:10, or the like. Note that the volume ratio 1:3:10 is expressed as HF:HNO<sub>3</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>COOH:H<sub>2</sub>O=2.1:3.3:12:7.5 in a molar ratio of molecules. There is no particular limitation on the composition of the other molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">In the above expressions using a ratio, the chemical solutions or the molar numbers each have a margin of error of Â±10%. For example, in the expression that the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid is 1:3:10, x:y:z (hydrofluoric acid (x), nitric acid (y), and acetic acid (z)) may be in a range of x=0.9 to 1.1, y=2.7 to 3.3, and z=9 to 11. Similarly, in the expression that the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid is 1:2:10, x:y:z (hydrofluoric acid (x), nitric acid (y), and acetic acid (z)) may be in a range of x=0.9 to 1.1, y=1.8 to 2.2, and z=9 to 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Crystal defects, voids, and the like due to addition of ions exist in the damaged semiconductor region, and an etchant penetrates easily thereinto. Accordingly, in the damaged semiconductor region, wet etching treatment progresses not only from a surface but also from the inside. Specifically, the etching tends to progress in such a manner that a deep hole is formed in a direction perpendicular to the plane surface of the substrate and then the hole is expanded. In other words, in the damaged semiconductor region, etching treatment progresses at a higher etching rate than in a less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region. Here, âetching rateâ means the etching amount (amount etched) per unit time. That is, âa film whose etching rate is highâ represents a film which is easily etched, and âa film whose etching rate is lowâ represents a film which is difficult to be etched. In addition, âto obtain etching selectivityâ means that, for example, a layer A and a layer B are etched under the condition where there is a sufficient difference between the etching rate of the layer A and the etching rate of the layer B. In addition, the less-damaged semiconductor region refers to a semiconductor region in which the degree of damage is relatively low as compared to that of the unseparated semiconductor region <b>125</b>, the semiconductor region <b>127</b> to which ions are added, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">More specifically, the etching rate of the damaged semiconductor region is twice or more as high as that of the non-damaged semiconductor region (or the less-damaged semiconductor region). That is, the etching selectivity of the damaged semiconductor region to the non-damaged semiconductor region (or the less-damaged semiconductor region) is 2 or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In this manner, when the wet etching treatment is performed using, as an etchant, the mixed solution which includes the substance that oxidizes the semiconductor material, the substance that dissolves the oxidized semiconductor material, and the substance that controls the speed of oxidation of the semiconductor material and the speed of dissolution of the oxidized semiconductor material, the damaged semiconductor region can be selectively removed. Accordingly, the amount of the semiconductor removed in the reprocessing treatment can be reduced, and the number times of reprocessing and use can be increased. Further, by the wet etching treatment, a plurality of semiconductor substrates <b>121</b> can be processed at one time; therefore, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment can be increased. Furthermore, since the second etching treatment can be performed in a short time, efficiency of the reprocessing treatment can be increased also for this reason.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Note that the thickness of the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b>) is largely different from that of the damaged semiconductor region in the other region (the semiconductor region <b>129</b>). Therefore, the etching selectivity of the projection <b>126</b> (the peripheral portion) to the other region (the central portion) is not uniform during the second etching treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Specifics are described below. Immediately after the second etching treatment is started, the damaged semiconductor region is first etched both in the projection <b>126</b> and in the other region; thus, the etching selectivity is approximately 1. After the damaged semiconductor region in the region other than the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>129</b>) is etched to be removed, the less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region is exposed in the region other than the projection <b>126</b>; thus, the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> is preferentially removed, and the etching selectivity becomes 2 or higher. After the damaged semiconductor region in the projection <b>126</b> (the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b>) is etched to be removed, the less-damaged semiconductor region or the non-damaged semiconductor region is exposed also in the projection <b>126</b>; thus, the etching selectivity returns to approximately 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In this manner, since the etching selectivity varies during the second etching treatment, the etching can be finished in consideration of this. For example, by stopping the etching treatment at the stage where the etching selectivity is reduced to lower than 2, the damaged semiconductor region can be removed while the amount of the semiconductor removed by the second etching treatment is reduced. In this case, the reprocessing treatment can be surely performed and a sufficient number of times of reprocessing can be secured. Note that the etching selectivity may be a value (a difference value) obtained by comparing the amounts of reduced thickness in a predetermined time (e.g., 30 seconds or 1 minute) or a value (a differential value) obtained by comparing the amounts of reduced thickness in an instant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In the above manner, the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is reprocessed, and a reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> is completed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Although most part of the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is removed by the above second etching treatment, part thereof is left in some cases. In such a case, other surface treatment is preferably performed after the second etching treatment so that the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added is completely removed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Alternatively, surface treatment such as laser beam irradiation treatment may be performed after the second etching treatment.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">In this embodiment, another example of a method of reprocessing treatment for a semiconductor substrate will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0016">&lt;First Etching Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">First, the first etching treatment is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The above embodiment may be referred to for details thereof. By this treatment, the insulating layer on a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0017">&lt;Second Etching Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Next, the second etching treatment is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). The above embodiment can also be referred to for details of the second etching treatment. By this treatment, a semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> from which the semiconductor region <b>125</b>, the semiconductor region <b>127</b>, and the semiconductor region <b>129</b> are removed is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0018">&lt;Planarization Treatment&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">In this embodiment, planarization treatment is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> after the second etching treatment, so that the reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> is manufactured (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). This treatment is performed because the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> cannot be used in a manufacturing process of an SOI substrate when a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> after the second etching treatment does not have enough planarity as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Note that in this embodiment, a case where the semiconductor region <b>129</b> is completely removed by the second etching treatment is described; however, in the case where the semiconductor region <b>129</b> cannot be sufficiently removed by the second etching treatment, it is preferable that the remaining semiconductor region <b>129</b> be removed together by planarization treatment described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Polishing treatment or laser beam irradiation treatment can be performed as the planarization treatment. The polishing treatment and the laser beam irradiation treatment may be performed a plurality of times, and may be performed in combination. In addition, the order of the treatment steps can be determined as appropriate without limitation. Irradiation treatment with lamp light may be performed instead of the irradiation treatment with a laser beam. In this embodiment, an example in which polishing treatment is performed as the planarization treatment is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">As a polishing method of the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b>, it is preferable to employ a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method. Here, the CMP method refers to a method by which a surface of an object is planarized by a combination of chemical and mechanical actions. For example, CMP is performed in the following manner: a polishing cloth is attached to a polishing stage, and the stage and the object are each rotated or vibrated while slurry (an abrasive) is supplied between the object and the polishing cloth. Consequently, the surface of the object is polished by chemical reaction between the slurry and the surface of the object and by an action of mechanical polishing of the object with the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">The polishing treatment using a CMP method may be performed one time or a plurality of times. When the polishing treatment is performed a plurality of times, for example, it is preferable that first polishing with a high polishing rate be performed and then finishing polishing with a low polishing rate be performed. At the first polishing, a polyurethane polishing cloth is preferably used, and the grain diameter of the slurry is preferably 120 nm to 180 nm, for example, approximately 150 nm. At the finishing polishing, a suede polishing cloth is preferably used, and the grain diameter of the slurry is preferably 45 nm to 75 nm, for example, approximately 60 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In this manner, when the polishing treatment using a CMP method is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> in addition to the above reprocessing method, the reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> can be formed to have a planarized surface whose average surface roughness is approximately 0.2 nm to 0.5 nm. Further, when the polishing treatment is performed a plurality of times at different polishing rates, the semiconductor substrate <b>130</b> can be planarized in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In this manner, the semiconductor region <b>125</b>, the semiconductor region <b>127</b>, and the semiconductor region <b>129</b> are removed by the first etching treatment and the second etching treatment and then the surface polishing treatment using a CMP method is performed, whereby the reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> with more favorable planarity can be obtained.</div>

<heading>Embodiment 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate of this embodiment, an SOI substrate is manufactured by bonding a semiconductor layer separated from a semiconductor substrate which is a bond substrate to a base substrate. The semiconductor substrate from which the semiconductor layer has been separated is subjected to reprocessing treatment and reused as a bond substrate. An example of a method for manufacturing the SOI substrate of this embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>, and a manufacturing process chart of an SOI substrate of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0020">&lt;Treatment for Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">First, a process of forming an embrittlement region <b>104</b> in a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to prepare for bonding with a base substrate <b>120</b> is described. This process relates to treatment for the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and corresponds to Process A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">First, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is prepared (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and the step A-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, for example, a single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate of silicon or the like can be used. Typical examples of commercially available silicon substrates include circular silicon substrates which are 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, and 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter. Further, in a peripheral portion of a silicon substrate, there is a chamfer portion for preventing chipping or cracking as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Note that the shape is not limited to the circular shape, and a silicon substrate which is processed into a rectangular shape or the like can also be used. The case where a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate is used as the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Note that a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is preferably cleaned using a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide water, and pure water (FPM), or the like, as appropriate. Further, dilute hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately to clean the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">After the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is cleaned, an insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and the step A-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The insulating layer <b>102</b> may be formed using a single insulating film or a stacked layer including a plurality of insulating films. The insulating layer <b>102</b> can be formed using an insulating film which contains silicon as a component, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film. In this embodiment, the case of using a silicon oxide film as the insulating layer <b>102</b> is described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Note that in this specification or the like, a silicon oxynitride film means a film that contains more oxygen atoms than nitrogen atoms, and contains oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 50 atomic % to 70 atomic %, 0.5 atomic % to 15 atomic %, 25 atomic % to 35 atomic %, and 0.1 atomic % to 10 atomic %, respectively, when they are measured by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering spectrometry (HFS). Further, a silicon nitride oxide film means a film that contains more nitrogen atoms than oxygen atoms, and contains oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 5 atomic % to 30 atomic %, 20 atomic % to 55 atomic %, 25 atomic % to 35 atomic %, and 10 atomic % to 30 atomic %, respectively, when they are measured by RBS and HFS. Note that percentages of nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and hydrogen fall within the ranges given above when the total number of atoms contained in the silicon oxynitride film or the silicon nitride oxide film is defined as 100 atomic %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In the case of using a silicon oxide film as the insulating layer <b>102</b>, the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be formed by a vapor deposition method such as a thermal CVD method, a plasma CVD method, an atmospheric pressure CVD method, or a bias ECRCVD method using a mixed gas of silane and oxygen, a mixed gas of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and oxygen, or the like. In this case, a surface of the insulating layer <b>102</b> may be densified by oxygen plasma treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">Alternatively, a silicon oxide film deposited by a chemical vapor deposition method using an organosilane gas may be used as the insulating layer <b>102</b>. For an organosilane gas, a silicon-containing compound such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylsilane (TMS) (chemical formula: Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), triethoxysilane (chemical formula: SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), or trisdimethylaminosilane (chemical formula: SiH(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Further alternatively, the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be formed using an oxide film obtained by oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Thermal oxidation treatment for forming the oxide film may be dry oxidation, and may be performed in an oxidation atmosphere to which a halogen-containing gas is added. As the halogen-containing gas, one or plural kinds of gases selected from HCl, HF, NF<sub>3</sub>, HBr, Cl<sub>2</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, and the like can be used. Note that the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed to cover the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>; however, this embodiment is not limited to this structure. In the case where the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed by a CVD method or the like over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, the insulating layer <b>102</b> may be formed over only one of the surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">As an example of formation conditions of the thermal oxide film, heat treatment is performed at higher than or equal to 700Â° C. and lower than or equal to 1100Â° C. (typically at approximately 950Â° C.) in an atmosphere containing HCl at a rate of 0.5 volume % to 10 volume % (preferably 3 volume %) with respect to oxygen. Treatment time may be 0.1 hour to 6 hours, preferably 0.5 hour to 1 hour. The thickness of the oxide film to be formed can be set in the range of 10 nm to 1100 nm (preferably 50 nm to 150 nm), for example, 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">By such thermal oxidation treatment in an atmosphere containing a halogen element, the oxide film can contain the halogen element. By containing the halogen element at a concentration of 1Ã10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1Ã10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, the oxide film captures heavy metal that is an extrinsic impurity (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, or Mo), so that contamination of the semiconductor layer to be formed later can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Further, the insulating layer <b>102</b> containing a halogen element such as chlorine can serve to getter impurities (e.g., mobile ions of Na or the like) which adversely affect the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Specifically, by heat treatment which is performed after the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed, impurities contained in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are separated out to the insulating layer <b>102</b>, reacted with the halogen atom (e.g., a chlorine atom), and captured. Accordingly, the impurities captured in the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be fixed and prevented from contaminating the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Further, when the insulating layer <b>102</b> is bonded to a glass substrate, the insulating layer <b>102</b> can also function as a film for fixing impurities such as Na contained in glass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In particular, the inclusion of halogen such as chlorine in the insulating layer <b>102</b> by heat treatment in an atmosphere containing halogen is effective in removing contaminants of the semiconductor substrate when cleaning of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is insufficient or when the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is repeatedly subjected to reprocessing treatment and used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Moreover, the halogen element contained in the oxidation treatment atmosphere terminates defects on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>; as a result, the local level density of an interface between the oxide film and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">The halogen element contained in the insulating layer <b>102</b> makes distortions in the insulating layer <b>102</b>. As a result, water absorption rate of the insulating layer <b>102</b> is improved and diffusion rate of water is increased. That is, when water is present on the surface of the insulating layer <b>102</b>, the water present on the surface can be rapidly absorbed and diffused into the insulating layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">In the case of using, as a base substrate, a glass substrate which contains impurities which decrease reliability of a semiconductor device, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, the insulating layer <b>102</b> preferably includes at least one or more films which can prevent the impurities in the base substrate from diffusing into the semiconductor layer of the SOI substrate. Examples of such a film include a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, and the like. With such a film included in the insulating layer <b>102</b>, the insulating layer <b>102</b> can function as a barrier film (also referred to as a blocking film).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">For example, a silicon nitride film can be formed using a mixed gas of silane and ammonium by a vapor deposition method such as a plasma CVD method. In addition, for example, a silicon nitride oxide can be formed using a mixed gas of silane, ammonia, and dinitrogen monoxide by a vapor deposition method such as a plasma CVD method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">For example, in the case of forming a barrier film having a single-layer structure as the insulating layer <b>102</b>, the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be formed using a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride oxide film with a thickness of greater than or equal to 15 nm and less than or equal to 300 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">In the case of forming a two-layer barrier film as the insulating layer <b>102</b>, the upper layer is formed using an insulating film with a high barrier property. An insulating film of the upper layer can be formed using, for example, a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride oxide film having a thickness of 15 nm to 300 nm. These films have a high blocking effect for preventing impurity diffusion, but their internal stress is also high. Therefore, as an insulating film of the lower layer that is in contact with the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, a film that has an effect of relieving the stress of the insulating film of the upper layer is preferably selected. As the insulating film with an effect of relieving the stress of the insulating film of the upper layer, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, a thermal oxide film formed by thermally oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and the like are given. The thickness of the insulating film of the lower layer can be greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">For example, in order for the insulating layer <b>102</b> to function as a barrier film, the insulating layer <b>102</b> is preferably formed using a combination of a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film and a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film and a silicon nitride oxide film, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">Next, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with an ion beam containing ions accelerated by an electric field through the insulating layer <b>102</b>, as indicated by arrows. Thus, the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed in a region at a desired depth from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> and the step A-<b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed is substantially the same as the average penetration depth of the ions, and can be adjusted by the acceleration energy of the ion beam and the incident angle of the ion beam. In addition, the acceleration energy can be adjusted by acceleration voltage, dosage, or the like. The thickness of a semiconductor layer <b>124</b> which is separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> later is determined by the depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed. The depth at which the embrittlement region <b>104</b> is formed can be set in the range of, for example, greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 500 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 50 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>; for example, the depth is preferably approximately 100 nm from the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Note that irradiation with ions is performed after formation of the insulating layer <b>102</b> in this embodiment; however, without being limited thereto, the irradiation with ions may be performed before the formation of the insulating layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">The embrittlement region <b>104</b> can be formed by ion doping treatment. The ion doping treatment can be performed with an ion doping apparatus. A typical example of an ion doping apparatus is a non-mass-separation apparatus with which an object placed in a chamber is irradiated with all ion species generated by excitation of a process gas into plasma. The non-mass-separation apparatus is an apparatus with which an object is irradiated with all ion species without mass separation of ion species in plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">Main components of an ion doping apparatus are as follows: a chamber in which an object is placed; an ion source for generating desired ions; and an acceleration mechanism for acceleration of ions for irradiation therewith. The ion source includes a gas supply device which supplies a source gas to generate desired ion species, an electrode for exciting the source gas to generate plasma, and the like. As the electrode for generating plasma, a capacitively-coupled high-frequency discharge electrode, a filament electrode, or the like is used. The acceleration mechanism includes electrodes such as an extraction electrode, an acceleration electrode, a deceleration electrode, and a ground electrode; a power source for supplying power to these electrodes; and the like. These electrodes included in the acceleration mechanism are provided with a plurality of openings or slits, through which ions that are generated from the ion source are accelerated. Note that components of the ion doping apparatus are not limited to those described above and may be changed as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">In this embodiment, the case where ions generated from a hydrogen gas are added to the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> with an ion doping apparatus is described. A hydrogen-containing gas such as H<sub>2 </sub>is supplied as a plasma source gas. A hydrogen gas is excited to generate plasma, ions contained in plasma are accelerated without mass separation, and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with the accelerated ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">In the above ion addition treatment, the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions to the total amount of ion species (H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>) that are generated from a hydrogen gas is set to 50% or higher. Preferably, the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions is set to 80% or higher. This is because increase in the percentage of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions in plasma enables hydrogen ions to be efficiently added to the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Note that the mass of an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion is three times as large as that of an H<sup>+</sup> ion; therefore, when one hydrogen atom is added to a depth, the acceleration voltage for an H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ion can be three times as high as that of an H<sup>+</sup> ion. For this reason, the takt time in the ion irradiation step can be shortened, and productivity and throughput can be improved. By irradiation with ions having the same mass, ions can be added in a concentrated manner to the same depth in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Ion doping apparatuses are inexpensive and excellent in use for large-area treatment. Therefore, by irradiation with H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions using an ion doping apparatus, significantly large effects such as improvement in semiconductor characteristics, increase in area, reduction in cost, and improvement in productivity can be obtained. Further, in the case where an ion doping apparatus is used, heavy metal may also be introduced at the time of the ion irradiation; however, by irradiation with ions through the insulating layer <b>102</b> containing chlorine atoms, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be prevented from being contaminated by the heavy metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">Further, the embrittlement region <b>104</b> may be formed by ion implantation treatment using an ion implantation apparatus. The ion implantation apparatus is a mass-separation apparatus with which an object that is placed in a chamber is irradiated with a specific ion species through mass separation of a plurality of ion species that are generated by plasma excitation of a source gas. In the case of using an ion implantation apparatus, H<sup>+</sup> ions, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions which are generated by excitation of a hydrogen gas or PH<sub>3 </sub>are mass-separated, and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is irradiated with any of these ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">With an ion implantation apparatus, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be irradiated with one kind of ions and ions can be added in a concentrated manner to the same depth of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Therefore, the profile of the added ions can be sharpened, and thus the surface planarity of the semiconductor layer to be separated can be easily increased. Moreover, the ion implantation apparatus is preferable because, owing to its electrode structure, contamination by heavy metal is relatively low and thus deterioration of characteristics of the semiconductor layer can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">Next, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> over which the insulating layer <b>102</b> is formed is cleaned. This cleaning step can be performed by ultrasonic cleaning with the use of pure water, by two-fluid jet cleaning with the use of pure water and nitrogen, or the like. The ultrasonic cleaning is preferably megahertz ultrasonic cleaning (megasonic cleaning). After the above ultrasonic cleaning or the two-fluid jet cleaning, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may be further cleaned with ozone water. By the cleaning with ozone water, removal of organic substances and surface activation treatment for improving the hydrophilicity of a surface of the insulating layer <b>102</b> can be performed.</div>

In an atmosphere containing oxygen, irradiation with ultraviolet light having a wavelength of less than 200 nm and ultraviolet light having a wavelength of greater than or equal to 200 nm is performed, whereby ozone can be generated and singlet oxygen can be generated by ozone.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Next, a process of preparing for bonding the base substrate <b>120</b> to the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is described. This process relates to treatment for the base substrate <b>120</b> and corresponds to Process B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">First, the base substrate <b>120</b> is prepared (see the step B-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As the base substrate <b>120</b>, a variety of glass substrates used in the electronics industry, such as a substrate of aluminosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass, or aluminoborosilicate glass; a quartz substrate; a ceramic substrate; a sapphire substrate; or the like can be used. Further, a ceramic substrate which contains silicon nitride and aluminum nitride as its main components and whose coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of silicon may be used. In addition, as the base substrate <b>120</b>, a single crystal semiconductor substrate (e.g., a single crystal silicon substrate) or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate (e.g., a polycrystalline silicon substrate) may be used. For example, a polycrystalline silicon substrate has advantages of being less expensive than a single crystal silicon substrate and having higher heat resistance than a glass substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">In the case where a glass substrate is used as the base substrate <b>120</b>, for example, a mother glass substrate which is developed for manufacturing liquid crystal panels is preferably used. As a mother glass substrate, substrates having the following sizes are known: the third generation (550 mmÃ650 mm), the 3.5-th generation (600 mmÃ720 mm), the fourth generation (680 mmÃ880 mm or 730 mmÃ920 mm), the fifth generation (1100 mmÃ1300 mm), the sixth generation (1500 mmÃ1850 mm), the seventh generation (1870 mmÃ2200 mm), the eighth generation (2200 mmÃ2400 mm), the ninth generation (2400 mmÃ2800 mm), the tenth generation (2850 mmÃ3050 mm), and the like. By manufacturing an SOI substrate with the use of a large-sized mother glass substrate as the base substrate <b>120</b>, the SOI substrate can have a large area. Increase in the area of the SOI substrate allows many ICs to be manufactured all at once, and thus the number of semiconductor devices manufactured from one substrate is increased; therefore, productivity can be dramatically increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Further, an insulating layer <b>122</b> is preferably formed over the base substrate <b>120</b> (see the step B-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Needless to say, the insulating layer <b>122</b> is not necessarily provided over the base substrate <b>120</b>; however, by forming a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, an aluminum nitride film, an aluminum nitride oxide film, or the like, which functions as a barrier film, over the base substrate <b>120</b> as the insulating layer <b>122</b> for example, impurities such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in the base substrate <b>120</b> can be prevented from entering the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">Since the insulating layer <b>122</b> is used as a bonding layer, a surface of the insulating layer <b>122</b> is preferably planarized in order to avoid defective bonding.

The thickness can be set as appropriate in the range of greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 50 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">A surface of the base substrate <b>120</b> is cleaned before the bonding.

Further, megahertz ultrasonic cleaning, two-fluid jet cleaning, cleaning with ozone water, or the like can be performed. In a manner similar to that of the insulating layer <b>102</b>, surface activation treatment such as irradiation treatment with an atomic beam or an ion beam, ultraviolet treatment, ozone treatment, plasma treatment, plasma treatment with bias application, or radical treatment is preferably performed on the surface of the insulating layer <b>122</b> before the bonding (see the step B-<b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">Next, a process of bonding the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to the base substrate <b>120</b> and separating the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> into the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is described. This process corresponds to Process C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">First, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> processed through the above process is bonded to the base substrate <b>120</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and the step C-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Here, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and the base substrate <b>120</b> are bonded to each other with the insulating layer <b>102</b> and the insulating layer <b>122</b> interposed therebetween; however, this embodiment is not limited to this structure in the case where the insulating layers are not formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The bonding can be performed by applying pressure of approximately 0.001 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 100 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably approximately 1 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 20 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>to one part at an end of the base substrate <b>120</b> so that bonding surfaces are close to each other. When pressure is applied so that the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> approaches or closely attached to the base substrate <b>120</b>, bonding of the substrates starts and spreads spontaneously to the entire surface. In this manner, the bonding between the base substrate <b>120</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is completed. This bonding is based on a principle of the Van der Waals force or the like, and strong bonding can be achieved even at room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Note that a region called an edge roll off region exists in a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. In the edge roll off region, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (the insulating layer <b>102</b>) is not in contact with the base substrate <b>120</b> (the insulating layer <b>122</b>) in some cases. Also in a chamfer portion which exists outside the edge roll off region (on an end side of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>), the base substrate <b>120</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are not in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">In a CMP method used for manufacturing the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, owing to its principle, polishing tends to progress in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate at higher speed than in a central portion thereof. Accordingly, in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, a region where the thickness of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is smaller than that in the central portion and the planarity is low is formed. This is the region called an edge roll off region. Even in the case where an end portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is not chamfered, bonding with the base substrate <b>120</b> is not performed in such an edge roll off region in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">In the case where a plurality of semiconductor substrates <b>100</b> are bonded to one base substrate <b>120</b>, pressure is preferably applied to each of the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b>. This is because a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> which is not in contact with the base substrate <b>120</b> may be formed due to differences in the thickness of the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b>. Note that even in the case where there are slight differences in the thickness of the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b>, bonding can be favorably performed when the semiconductor substrates <b>100</b> can be closely attached to the base substrate <b>120</b> owing to bend of the base substrate <b>120</b> or the like; therefore, this embodiment is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">After the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is bonded to the base substrate <b>120</b>, heat treatment for increasing the bonding strength is preferably performed (see the step C-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The temperature of the heat treatment is preferably set to a temperature at which a crack is not caused in the embrittlement region <b>104</b>, for example, higher than or equal to 200Â° C. and lower than or equal to 450Â° C. Alternatively, when the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is bonded to the base substrate <b>120</b> while being heated in this temperature range, a similar effect can be obtained. Note that it is preferable that the above heat treatment be successively performed in an apparatus or a place where the bonding has been performed. This is for prevention of separation of the substrates owing to transportation thereof before the heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Note that when a particle or the like is attached to the bonding surface in bonding the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to the base substrate <b>120</b>, the portion where the particle or the like is attached is not bonded. In order to avoid attachment of a particle, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and the base substrate <b>120</b> are preferably bonded in a treatment chamber where air tightness is secured. At the time of bonding the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to the base substrate <b>120</b>, the process chamber may be in a state of reduced pressure (e.g., approximately 5.0Ã10<sup>â3 </sup>Pa) so that the atmosphere of the bonding treatment is cleaned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">Next, heat treatment is performed so that the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is separated along the embrittlement region <b>104</b>, and thus the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is formed over the base substrate <b>120</b> while the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and the step C-<b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Since the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and the base substrate <b>120</b> are bonded to each other in a region other than the edge roll off region and the chamfer portion, the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> which is separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is fixed over the base substrate <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">Here, the heat treatment for separating the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is performed at a temperature below the strain point of the base substrate <b>120</b>. This heat treatment can be performed using a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) apparatus, a resistance heating furnace, a microwave heating apparatus, or the like. Examples of RTA apparatuses include a gas rapid thermal anneal (GRTA) apparatus, a lamp rapid thermal anneal (LRTA) apparatus, and the like. In the case of using a GRTA apparatus, the temperature can be set at higher than or equal to 550Â° C. and lower than or equal to 650Â° C., and the treatment time can be set to longer than or equal to 0.5 minute and shorter than or equal to 60 minutes. In the case of using a resistance heating furnace, the temperature can be set at higher than or equal to 200Â° C. and lower than or equal to 650Â° C., and the treatment time can be set to longer than or equal to 2 hours and shorter than or equal to 4 hours. Further, after the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is separated, heat treatment may be performed at a temperature of 500Â° C. or higher so that the concentration of hydrogen that remains in the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">Further, the above heat treatment may be performed by irradiation with a microwave or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">In interfaces along which the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> have been separated, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> to which ions are added and a semiconductor region <b>133</b> to which ions are added are left. These regions correspond to the embrittlement region <b>104</b> before the separation.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">Further, the projection <b>126</b> exists in a region of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b>, in which the bonding is not performed (specifically a region corresponding to the edge roll off region and the chamfer portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>).

The semiconductor region <b>127</b>, as well as the semiconductor region <b>129</b> and the like, has been part of the embrittlement region <b>104</b>, and thus includes a lot of hydrogen and crystal defects.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Next, a process of planarizing a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> which is bonded to the base substrate <b>120</b> to recover crystallinity is described.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">The semiconductor region <b>133</b> over the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> which is closely attached to the base substrate <b>120</b> has crystal defects and the planarity is lowered owing to formation of the embrittlement region <b>104</b> and separation of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> along the embrittlement region <b>104</b>. Therefore, the semiconductor region <b>133</b> may be removed by polishing or the like so that the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is planarized (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and the step D-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The planarization is not necessarily performed; however, the planarization enables improvement in characteristics of an interface between the semiconductor layer and a layer (e.g., an insulating layer) formed on a surface of the semiconductor layer in a later step. Specifically, polishing can be performed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), liquid jet polishing, or the like. Here, simultaneously with the removal of the semiconductor region <b>133</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is polished to be a thin film in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">Further, the semiconductor region <b>133</b> can be removed by etching so that the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is planarized.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Furthermore, by the polishing and the etching, in addition to the planarization of the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> can be reduced in thickness so as to have a thickness which is suitable for the semiconductor element that is completed later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">Laser irradiation may be performed on the semiconductor region <b>133</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> in order to reduce crystal defects and improve the planarity (see the step D-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">In the case where the semiconductor region <b>133</b> is removed and the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is planarized by dry etching before the laser irradiation, defects might occur in the vicinity of the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Since increase in the temperature of the base substrate <b>120</b> can be suppressed in the laser irradiation step, a substrate having low heat resistance can be used as the base substrate <b>120</b>. It is preferable that the semiconductor region <b>133</b> be completely melted and the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> be partially melted by the laser irradiation. This is because when the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is completely melted, recrystallization of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is accompanied with disordered nucleation of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> in a liquid phase and the crystallinity of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is lowered. By partially melting the semiconductor layer <b>124</b>, crystal growth progresses from a solid phase portion which is not melted; thus, crystal defects in the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> are reduced and the crystallinity is recovered. Note that complete melting of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> indicates that the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> is melted up to the interface between the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> and the insulating layer <b>102</b> to be in a liquid state. On the other hand, partial melting of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> indicates that a part of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> (here an upper layer) is melted to be in a liquid phase while another part thereof (here a lower layer) remains in a solid phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">After the laser irradiation, the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>124</b> may be etched.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">Next, the second etching treatment is performed, so that the semiconductor region <b>125</b> and the semiconductor region <b>127</b> which are included in the projection <b>126</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> are selectively removed and the reprocessed semiconductor substrate <b>132</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and the step E-<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). At this time, the semiconductor region <b>129</b> is also removed. The above embodiments can also be referred to for details of this step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">Here, in the case where the planarity of the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> after the second etching treatment is not enough, the semiconductor substrate <b>121</b> can be planarized by polishing (see the step E-<b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">As described in this embodiment, the semiconductor substrate processed through the reprocessing treatment process is repeatedly used, whereby manufacturing cost for an SOI substrate can be reduced.

<heading>Embodiment 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">In this embodiment, the case where an SOI substrate is manufactured using a silicon substrate with high heat resistance or the like as a base substrate will be described. Note that a method described in this embodiment is common to the above embodiment in many points. Therefore, different points will be mainly described in this embodiment. Drawings will not be particularly shown in this embodiment because those of the above embodiment can be commonly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0026">&lt;Treatment for Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">In a semiconductor substrate that is used as a bond substrate, an insulating layer and an embrittlement region are formed. Treatment for the semiconductor substrate, which includes the formation of the insulating layer and the embrittlement region, is similar to that in the above embodiment. Therefore, description in the above embodiment may be referred to for such treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0027">&lt;Treatment for Base Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">In this embodiment, a substrate with high heat resistance is used as a base substrate. Examples of a substrate with high heat resistance include a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, semiconductor substrates (e.g., a single crystal silicon substrate and a polycrystalline silicon substrate), and the like. In this embodiment, the case where a single crystal silicon substrate is used as the base substrate is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">A typical example of a single crystal silicon substrate is a circular substrate which is 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, or 16 inches (400 mm) in diameter. Note that the shape is not limited to the circular shape, and a silicon substrate which is processed into a rectangular shape or the like can also be used. In the description given below, the case where a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate is used as the base substrate is described. Note that the size of the base substrate may be substantially the same as or different from that of the bond substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">Note that a surface of the base substrate is preferably cleaned using a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), or the like, as appropriate. Further, dilute hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately to clean the surface of the base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">An insulating layer may be formed over the base substrate. In the case where an insulating layer is formed over the base substrate, an insulating layer on the bond substrate side can be omitted. The insulating layer may be formed using a single insulating film or a stacked layer including a plurality of insulating films. The insulating layer can be formed using an insulating film which contains silicon as a component, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">For example, the above insulating layer can be formed by thermal oxidation treatment. Although dry oxidation is preferably employed as the thermal oxidation treatment, the thermal oxidation treatment may be performed in an oxidation atmosphere to which a halogen-containing gas is added. As the halogen-containing gas, one or plural kinds of gases selected from HCl, HF, NF<sub>3</sub>, HBr, Cl<sub>2</sub>, ClF<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, and the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">The surface of the base substrate is cleaned before bonding. The surface of the base substrate can be cleaned with chlorine acid and hydrogen peroxide water or by megahertz ultrasonic cleaning, two-fluid jet cleaning, cleaning with ozone water, or the like. Further, the bonding may be performed after the surface is subjected to surface activation treatment such as irradiation treatment with an atomic beam or an ion beam, ultraviolet treatment, ozone treatment, plasma treatment, plasma treatment with bias application, or radical treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0028">&lt;Bonding and Separation of Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">Next, the semiconductor substrate (the bond substrate) and the base substrate are bonded to each other, and the semiconductor substrate is separated. Accordingly, a semiconductor layer is formed over the base substrate. The above embodiment can be referred to for details of this process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">In this embodiment, the single crystal silicon substrate with high heat resistance is used as the base substrate. Therefore, the upper limit of the temperature of various heat treatments can be raised up to the vicinity of a melting point of the single crystal silicon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">For example, the upper limit of the temperature of heat treatment for separating the semiconductor substrate can be set at approximately 1200Â° C. When the temperature of the heat treatment is set at 700Â° C. or higher, bonding strength with the base substrate can be further increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0029">&lt;Treatment for Semiconductor Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Next, a surface of the semiconductor layer bonded to the base substrate is planarized, and the crystallinity is recovered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">In the semiconductor layer which is closely attached to the base substrate, crystal defects due to formation of the embrittlement region and separation of the semiconductor substrate along the embrittlement region are formed, and the planarity of the semiconductor layer is lowered. Therefore, heat treatment is preferably performed to reduce the crystal defects and to improve the planarity of the surface. The heat treatment is preferably performed under the temperature condition of 800Â° C. to 1300Â° C., typically 850Â° C. to 1200Â° C. When heat treatment is performed under such a relatively high temperature condition, crystal defects can be sufficiently reduced and the planarity of the surface can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">For the heat treatment, a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) apparatus, a resistance heating furnace, a microwave heating apparatus, or the like can be used. For example, in the case of using a resistance heating furnace, the heat treatment may be performed approximately at 950Â° C. to 1150Â° C. for 1 minute to 4 hours. Note that the heat treatment for separating the semiconductor substrate, if performed at higher temperature, can be performed instead of this heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">The semiconductor layer may be irradiated with a laser beam before or after the heat treatment. By the laser irradiation, crystal defects that cannot be repaired by the heat treatment can be repaired. The above embodiment can be referred to for details of the laser irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">In addition, before or after the heat treatment, a semiconductor region in an upper portion of the semiconductor layer may be removed by polishing or the like so that the surface thereof is planarized. By this planarization treatment, the surface of the semiconductor layer can be further planarized. Specifically, the polishing can be chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), liquid jet polishing, or the like. Note that the semiconductor layer may be reduced in thickness by this treatment in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Alternatively, the semiconductor region in the upper portion of the semiconductor layer can be removed by etching so that the surface thereof is planarized. For the above etching, for example, a dry etching method such as a reactive ion etching (RIE) method, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method, an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) etching method, a parallel plate (capacitively coupled) etching method, a magnetron plasma etching method, a dual-frequency plasma etching method, or a helicon wave plasma etching method can be employed. Note that both the polishing and the etching may be used for the planarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">Furthermore, by the polishing and the etching, in addition to the planarization of the surface of the semiconductor layer, the semiconductor layer can be reduced in thickness so as to have a thickness which is suitable for the semiconductor element that is completed later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">When the SOI substrate obtained through the above process is used for a subsequent process of manufacturing a semiconductor device, various kinds of semiconductor devices can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0030">&lt;Reprocessing Treatment of Semiconductor Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">The above embodiment can be referred to for details of reprocessing treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">As described in this embodiment, the semiconductor substrate processed through the reprocessing treatment process is repeatedly used, whereby manufacturing cost for an SOI substrate can be reduced. In particular, by employing such heat treatment at high temperature as described in this embodiment, an SOI substrate having favorable characteristics can be manufactured even when there remains a slight defect in the bond substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">The structure described in this embodiment can be used in appropriate combination with the structure described in any of the other embodiments.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">An example of a semiconductor device which includes the SOI substrate manufactured in either of the above embodiments is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example of a semiconductor device including a transistor <b>280</b> which is an n-channel thin film transistor and a transistor <b>281</b> which is a p-channel thin film transistor.

Various kinds of semiconductor devices can be formed by combining such a plurality of thin film transistors (TFTs). A method for manufacturing the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">First, an SOI substrate is prepared. As the SOI substrate, the SOI substrate manufactured in either of the above embodiments can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">Next, a semiconductor layer is etched to be divided into an island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>251</b> and an island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>252</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>251</b> is included in the n-channel TFT, and the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> is included in the p-channel TFT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">An insulating layer <b>254</b> is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>252</b>, and then a gate electrode <b>255</b> and a gate electrode <b>256</b> are respectively formed over the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> with the insulating layer <b>254</b> interposed therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">In order to control threshold voltage of the TFTs, it is preferable to add an impurity element which serves as an acceptor, such as boron, aluminum, or gallium, or an impurity element which serves as a donor, such as phosphorus or arsenic, to the semiconductor layers. For example, an impurity element which serves as an acceptor is added into a region where the n-channel TFT is to be formed, and an impurity element which serves as a donor is added to a region where the p-channel TFT is to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Next, an n-type low-concentration impurity region <b>257</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>251</b>, and a p-type high-concentration impurity region <b>259</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>252</b>. Specifically, first, the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> used for the p-channel TFT is covered with a resist mask and an impurity element is added to the semiconductor layer <b>251</b>, so that the n-type low-concentration impurity region <b>257</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>251</b>. Phosphorus or arsenic may be added as the impurity element. The gate electrode <b>255</b> serves as a mask, whereby the n-type low-concentration impurity region <b>257</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> in a self-aligned manner. Further, a region of the semiconductor layer <b>251</b>, which overlaps with the gate electrode <b>255</b>, serves as a channel formation region <b>258</b>. Next, after the mask which covers the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> is removed, the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> used for the n-channel TFT is covered with a resist mask. Then, an impurity element is added to the semiconductor layer <b>252</b>. Boron, aluminum, gallium, or the like may be added as the impurity element. Here, the gate electrode <b>256</b> functions as a mask, and the p-type high-concentration impurity region <b>259</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> in a self-aligned manner. A region of the semiconductor layer <b>252</b>, which overlaps with the gate electrode <b>256</b>, serves as a channel formation region <b>260</b>. Note that the method in which the n-type low-concentration impurity region <b>257</b> is formed and then the p-type high-concentration impurity region <b>259</b> is formed is described in this embodiment; however, the p-type high-concentration impurity region <b>259</b> can be formed first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">Next, after the resist mask which covers the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> is removed, an insulating layer having a single-layer structure or a stacked structure, which includes a nitride such as silicon nitride or an oxide such as silicon oxide, is formed by a plasma CVD method or the like. This insulating layer is anisotropically etched in a perpendicular direction, whereby a sidewall insulating layer <b>261</b> and a sidewall insulating layer <b>262</b> are formed in contact with side surfaces of the gate electrode <b>255</b> and the gate electrode <b>256</b>, respectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Next, the semiconductor layer <b>252</b> is covered with a resist mask, and an impurity element is added to the semiconductor layer <b>251</b> at a high dose.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">After activation treatment (heat treatment) of the impurity elements, an insulating layer <b>268</b> containing hydrogen is formed.

The insulating layer <b>268</b> can be formed by deposition of silicon nitride or silicon nitride oxide by a plasma CVD method at a process temperature of 350Â° C. or lower.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">In this example, an insulating layer was removed from a semiconductor substrate formed in manufacturing an SOI substrate, and wet etching was performed on the semiconductor substrate with the use of various kinds of etchants. The results are shown below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">First, semiconductor substrates used in this example are described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">In this example, a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate with a size of 5 inches square was employed as the semiconductor substrates. First, thermal oxidation was performed on the semiconductor substrates in an HCl atmosphere to form a thermal oxide film with a thickness of 100 nm on a surface of each of the substrates. The thermal oxidation was performed at 950Â° C. for 4 hours in a thermal oxidation atmosphere where the rate of HCl to oxygen was 3 volume %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">Next, hydrogen was added to each of the semiconductor substrates through the surface of the thermal oxide film with the use of an ion doping apparatus. In this example, by irradiation with ionized hydrogen, an embrittlement region was formed in each of the semiconductor substrates. The condition of the ion doping was set as follows: the acceleration voltage of 40 kV and the dose of 2.0Ã10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">Then, each of the semiconductor substrates was bonded to a glass substrate with the thermal oxide film interposed therebetween. After that, heat treatment at 200Â° C. for 120 minutes and then heat treatment at 600Â° C. for 120 minutes were performed, so that a thin film single crystal silicon layer was separated from each of the semiconductor substrates along the embrittlement region. Accordingly, SOI substrates were manufactured, and at the same time, semiconductor substrates each having a projection in a peripheral portion thereof were formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">Next, treatment performed on the above semiconductor substrates is described.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">Here, the etching amount in the central portion of the substrate was calculated from change in the thickness of the central portion of the substrate before and after the etching. The thickness of the substrate was calculated from a difference between the values of laser displacement sensors (LK-G30 manufactured by Keyence Corporation) that were provided above and below a measurement stage (Sorter 1000 manufactured by Lapmaster SFT Corporation). The measurement of the substrate thickness was performed on 10 pointsÃ10 points in a region of 107 mm square in the central portion of the substrate. Further, the etching amount in the central portion of the substrate was obtained by comparing the average values of the measurement results. The repetition accuracy of the laser displacement sensor is Â±0.05 Î¼m, and the repetition accuracy of the thickness of the substrate is Â±0.5 Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">From comparison of the optical micrographs of FIGS. <b>10</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>B<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>C<b>1</b>, and <b>10</b>C<b>2</b> and FIGS. <b>11</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>11</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>B<b>2</b>, <b>11</b>C<b>1</b>, and <b>11</b>C<b>2</b>, it is found that steps due to the projection on the left side of the micrographs were reduced as the etching time was increased. For example, as shown in FIGS. <b>11</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>11</b>A<b>2</b>, when the etching time was 4 minutes, few steps were observed. The same conclusion can be obtained from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> which are graphs of the step measurement. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> indicate that wet etching using the mixed solution A progresses in such a manner that a hole is formed in a step of the peripheral portion of the substrate in a direction perpendicular to the plane surface of the substrate and then the hole is expanded. This indicates that the mixed solution A penetrates the semiconductor region (the damaged semiconductor region including crystal defects or microvoids) included in the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate and then the step is removed from the inside of the semiconductor region. Such wet etching using the mixed solution A tends to progress in a manner different from that in the case of using another etchant, which is described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">The graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> showing the etching amount in the central portion of the semiconductor substrate indicates that the etching amount of the semiconductor substrate is small enough at least until an etching time of 6 minutes and is in the range of margin of error in the measurement of the substrate thickness.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">Here, the selectivity 1 is obtained by dividing the average value of the etching amount in the step (a region with a width of 0.1 mm) in the peripheral portion of the substrate by the average value of the etching amount in the central portion of the substrate. The selectivity of differences (the selectivity 2) is obtained from the etching amount of 0 minute to 1 minute, the etching amount of 1 minute to 2 minutes, the etching amount of 2 minutes to 4 minutes, and the etching amount of 4 minutes to 6 minutes. For example, the etching amount in the central portion of the semiconductor substrate from 1 minute to 2 minutes is calculated as follows: 0.14-0.096=0.044 (Î¼m). The etching amount in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate from 1 minute to 2 minutes is calculated as follows: 0.225-0.101=0.124 (Î¼m). Accordingly, the selectivity 2 in this case is obtained as follows: 0.124/0.044=2.818.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">According to Table 2, the selectivity of differences (the selectivity 2) varies with etching time. Specifically, the selectivity is approximately 1 soon after the etching is started, becomes 2 or higher, and then returns to approximately 1. This is considered to be caused by the following reason. First, at the beginning of the etching, the damaged semiconductor region left in the central portion of the semiconductor substrate is removed together with the damaged semiconductor region in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate; therefore, there is no large difference in the etching rate between the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate and the central portion of the semiconductor substrate. Consequently, the selectivity is approximately 1. After the damaged semiconductor region in the central portion of the semiconductor substrate is removed, the etching rate is lowered in the central portion of the semiconductor substrate while the etching rate is not lowered in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate because the damaged semiconductor region still remains therein. Consequently, the selectivity is increased (specifically to 2 or higher). After that, the damaged semiconductor region in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate is removed and the etching rates of the peripheral portion and the central portion of the semiconductor substrate become substantially equal. That is, the selectivity returns to approximately 1. Owing to such variation in the selectivity, the damaged semiconductor region is selectively removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">The selectivities 1 in the etching time of 2 minutes and 4 minutes are as high as 1.607 and 1.748, respectively. Further, the selectivities 2 in the etching time of 1 minute to 2 minutes and 2 minutes to 4 minutes are as high as 2.818 and 2.609, respectively. In this manner, with the use of the mixed solution A (the mixed solution where hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid are mixed at a volume ratio of 1:3:10), the step (the projection) in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate can be selectively removed in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">It is found that in the etching using the mixed solution B, etching progresses at a slow pace and the step is not removed even when the etching time is set to 8 minutes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15C</figref>). Further, the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is gradually etched from the surface and a deep hole is not formed, which is different from the case of using the mixed solution A. Thus, the following is found: even when the semiconductor substrate is etched using the mixed solution B, the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is not removed or is removed over a long period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">The step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is not removed by the etching using the mixed solution C (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A to 17C</figref>). Thus, it is found that the semiconductor substrate is hardly etched when the semiconductor substrate is subjected to the etching using the mixed solution C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">In the etching using the mixed solution D, the etching amount in the central portion of the substrate is increased in proportion to the etching time (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), while the step remains in the peripheral portion of the substrate (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref> and <b>19</b>A to <b>19</b>C). Thus, by using the mixed solution D as an etchant, the entire semiconductor substrate is evenly etched and the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate cannot be selectively removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">By the etching using the mixed solution E, the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is not removed as in the case of using the mixed solution C (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A to 20C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref>). Thus, it is found that the semiconductor substrate is hardly etched when the semiconductor substrate is subjected to the etching using the mixed solution E.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">In the etching using the TMAH aqueous solution, etching progresses at a slow pace, and the step is not removed even when the etching time is set to 8 minutes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A to 22C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A to 23C</figref>). Thus, the following is found: even when the semiconductor substrate is etched using the TMAH aqueous solution, the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is not removed or is removed over a long period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">Here, the mixed solution A, the mixed solution B, the mixed solution C, and the mixed solution D are each a three-component mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid. A function and reaction of each element are as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">Nitric acid oxidizes silicon. This reaction is represented by the formula (1).

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Acetic acid stabilizes the mixed solution and suppresses rapid etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">As described above, the three-component mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid has a function of etching silicon by repeating the oxidation of silicon shown in the formula (1) and the dissolution of silicon oxide shown in the formula (2). Therefore, in the case where the amount of hydrofluoric acid is large in the three-component mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid, oxidation of silicon by nitric acid shown in the formula (1) is a rate-limiting factor. In the case where the amount of nitric acid is large, dissolution of silicon oxide by hydrofluoric acid shown in the formula (2) is a rate-limiting factor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">Accordingly, the following assumption can be made: since the amount of nitric acid contained in the mixed solution C was small, oxidation of silicon was a rate-limiting factor in the wet etching. The same can be said to the mixed solution E in which hydrogen peroxide oxidizes silicon. It is assumed that wet etching did not progress in the mixed solution E because of small oxidizing power of hydrogen peroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">As for the mixed solution D, the following assumption can be made: reactions of the formula (1) and the formula (2) progressed rapidly because the amount of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid was large; as a result, the selectivity between the peripheral portion of the substrate and the central portion of the substrate could not be obtained and thus wet etching was performed evenly on the entire substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">In addition, it is assumed that since the amount of hydrofluoric acid was small in the mixed solution B, dissolution of silicon oxide was a rate-limiting factor in the wet etching. This is because, when the amount of hydrofluoric acid is small, etching from the inside of the damaged semiconductor region due to crystal defects or microvoids is less likely to be caused and etching from the surface of the damaged semiconductor region preferentially progresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">On the other hand, the mixed solution A contains hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid at a favorable balance; therefore, neither of the reactions of the formula (1) and the formula (2) is a rate-limiting factor. Moreover, effect of suppression of etching can be obtained by acetic acid, and thus the entire substrate is prevented from being evenly etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240">When the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is thus etched using the mixed solution A (the mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid at a volume ratio of 1:3:10), the projection in the peripheral portion of the substrate can be removed in a short time with the selectivity between the peripheral portion of the substrate and the central portion of the substrate maintained. Consequently, the reprocessing treatment of the semiconductor substrate can be performed surely and effectively.</div>
<heading>Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0241">This example shows results of comparing the case where a combination of wet etching treatment using the mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid and CMP treatment was employed as reprocessing treatment, with the case where CMP treatment was mainly employed without using the wet etching treatment. As for CMP treatment, after treatment with a high polishing rate, treatment with a low polishing rate (finishing polishing) was performed. Note that in the case where the above wet etching treatment was not employed, the time for CMP treatment was set longer so that the level of reprocessing treatment was equal to that in the case of employing the wet etching treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">A semiconductor substrate to be subjected to the reprocessing treatment was manufactured in a manner similar to that of the above example. The above example can be referred to for details.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">The two kinds of reprocessed semiconductor substrates manufactured by the above methods were subjected to observation with an optical microscope, step measurement with a step measurement apparatus (Surfcoder manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory Ltd.), evaluation of planarity with scanning probe microscopes (SPA-500 and SPI3800N manufactured by SII Nano Technology Inc.), and measurement of the amount of reduction in the thickness of the semiconductor substrate in the reprocessing treatment (with the use of Sorter 1000 manufactured by Lapmaster SFT Corporation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref> are optical micrographs (Nomarski images at 50-fold magnification) of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate before the reprocessing treatment and of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate after the above wet etching treatment, respectively. Similarly, the results of step measurement are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, the semiconductor substrate before the reprocessing treatment has a step in its peripheral portion, and an insulating layer and silicon are respectively observed in the peripheral portion and the central portion. According to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, it can be seen that a step with a thickness of approximately 0.2 Î¼m exists in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate before the reprocessing treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">On the other hand, in the semiconductor substrate shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, the step (a projection) which has once existed in the peripheral portion is not observed and silicon is observed in the entire surface. Note that a vertical white line on the left side of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> represents an edge of the substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> also indicates that the step is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">Next, results of evaluating the planarity of the two kinds of reprocessed semiconductor substrates with the use of a scanning probe microscope are shown. Conditions of the measurement with the scanning probe microscope were as follows: the scan rate was 1.0 Hz, the measurement area was 1 Î¼mÃ1 Î¼m, and the measurement points were 2. The measurement was conducted using dynamic force mode (DFM). Here, the dynamic force mode is a mode for measuring the surface shape of a sample in a state where a cantilever is resonated while the distance between a probe and the sample is controlled so that the vibration amplitude of the cantilever is maintained constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">The planarity of the reprocessed semiconductor substrate was evaluated using the average plane roughness (Ra) and the maximum peak-to-valley height (P-V). Here, the average surface roughness (Ra) is obtained by three-dimension expansion of center line average surface roughness Ra which is defined by JIS B 0601:2001 (ISO 4287:1997) so that Ra can be applied to a measurement surface, and is an average value of the absolute values of deviations from a reference surface to a specific surface. The maximum peak-to-valley height (P-V) is a difference between the height of the highest peak and the height of the lowest valley in the specific surface. The peak and the valley refer to a peak and a valley obtained by three-dimensional expansion of the âpeakâ and the âvalleyâ defined by JIS B 0601:2001 (ISO 4287:1997). The peak refers to the highest point of the peaks. The valley refers to the lowest point of the valleys.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">In manufacturing the substrate A, the reduced amount was 1.38 Î¼m. Meanwhile, in manufacturing the substrate B, the reduced amount was 6.96 Î¼m. This indicates that the reduced amount in manufacturing the substrate A was approximately one fourth of that in manufacturing the substrate B. In particular, the amount reduced by etching in manufacturing the substrate A was only 0.41 Î¼m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0264">Accordingly, by reprocessing treatment using the combination of the above etching treatment and CMP treatment, the semiconductor substrate can be prevented from being reduced by the reprocessing treatment while the planarity of the reprocessed semiconductor substrate is maintained.</div>
<heading>Example 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0265">This example shows observation results of a cross section of a semiconductor substrate which was provided with a thermal oxide film and then subjected to hydrogen ion irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0266">In this example, a rectangular single crystal silicon substrate with a size of 5 inches square was used as the semiconductor substrate. First, thermal oxidation was performed on the semiconductor substrate in an HCl atmosphere to form a thermal oxide film with a thickness of 100 nm on a surface of the substrate. The thermal oxidation was performed under the condition of 950Â° C. for 4 hours in a thermal oxidation atmosphere containing HCl at 3 volume % with respect to oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0267">Next, hydrogen was added to the semiconductor substrate through the surface of the thermal oxide film with the use of an ion doping apparatus. In this example, by irradiation with ionized hydrogen, an embrittlement region was formed in the semiconductor substrate. Conditions of ion doping were set such that the acceleration voltage was 50 kV and the dose was 2.0Ã10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the embrittlement region was formed at a depth of approximately 250 nm from the surface of the thermal oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0268"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> is a cross-sectional TEM image of a semiconductor substrate on which the above treatment was performed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> is a cross-sectional TEM image of the semiconductor substrate which was subjected to heat treatment and then separated along the embrittlement region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0269"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> indicate that many crystal defects were formed in the vicinity of the surface of the single crystal substrate. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> shows that the semiconductor substrate was separated at a depth of 139 nm from the surface thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0270">Here, a projection due to failure in bonding with a base substrate was formed in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate after the separation. In addition, like the separated semiconductor layer, the remaining semiconductor layer (the damaged semiconductor region) which is included in the projection has crystal defects or microvoids. Therefore, when etching using a mixed solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid is performed as described in the above examples, the projection formed in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate after separation can be selectively removed.</div>
<heading>Example 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0271">This example shows results of examining the case of using, as an etchant, the mixed solution (the mixed solution A) where hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:3:10 and the case of using, as an etchant, a mixed solution (hereinafter referred to as a mixed solution A+) where hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:2:10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0272">Note that semiconductor substrates used in this example are similar to those used in Example 1 and thus details thereof are omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0273">Treatment performed on the above semiconductor substrates was as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0274">First, in order to remove an insulating layer which was formed to cover the semiconductor substrate, the semiconductor substrate was subjected to wet etching treatment using a mixed solution (product name: LAL500, produced by Stella Chemifa Corporation) containing hydrofluoric acid, ammonium fluoride, and a surfactant. At this time, the solution temperature was room temperature and the etching time was 300 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0275">Next, the semiconductor substrate from which the insulating layer had been removed was subjected to wet etching using, as an etchant, the mixed solution (the mixed solution A) where hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:3:10 or the mixed solution (the mixed solution A+) where hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:2:10. The mixed solution A and the mixed solution A+ were produced using hydrofluoric acid at a concentration of 50 weight % (produced by Stella Chemifa Corporation), nitric acid at a concentration of 70 weight % (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and acetic acid at a concentration of 97.7 weight % (produced by Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0276"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref> is an optical micrograph (a Nomarski image at 50-fold magnification) of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate after wet etching using the mixed solution A+. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref> is an optical micrograph (a Nomarski image) at 500-fold magnification. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, in the wet etching using the mixed solution A+, a residue was not observed even under the condition where a residue due to etching may be generated in the wet etching using the mixed solution A. This is considered to be caused by the following reason: by increasing the rate of hydrofluoric acid to nitric acid slightly from 1:3 (hydrofluoric acid: nitric acid), a formed oxide film is quickly removed and generation of a residue is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0277">In this manner, it is found that when the step in the peripheral portion of the substrate is etched using the mixed solution A+ (the mixed solution where the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid is 1:2:10), generation of a residue can be suppressed as compared to the case of using the mixed solution A (the mixed solution where the volume ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid is 1:3:10). The same can be said to the case of using a mixed solution which contains hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid at a volume ratio of 1.5:3:10. On the other hand, when the rate of hydrofluoric acid to nitric acid was too high as compared to that in the mixed solution of 1:3:10, as in the case where the mixed solution has a ratio of 1:1:10, surface roughness, the remnant of the step, and the like were observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0278">According to this example, it can be understood that by increasing the rate of hydrofluoric acid to nitric acid slightly from 1:3 (hydrofluoric acid: nitric acid), reprocessing treatment of a semiconductor substrate can be performed more surely and effectively.</div>
