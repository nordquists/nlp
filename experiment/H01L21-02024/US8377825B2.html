<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to the manufacture of semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) structures using an improved process for making same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">To date, the semiconductor material most commonly used in semiconductor-on-insulator structures has been silicon. Such structures have been referred to in the literature as silicon-on-insulator structures and the abbreviation “SOI” has been applied to such structures. SOI technology is becoming increasingly important for high performance thin film transistors, solar cells, and displays, such as active matrix displays. SOI structures may include a thin layer of substantially single crystal silicon on an insulating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Various ways of obtaining SOI structures include epitaxial growth of silicon (Si) on lattice matched substrates. An alternative process includes the bonding of a single crystal silicon wafer to another silicon wafer on which an oxide layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>has been grown, followed by polishing or etching of the top wafer down to, for example, a 0.05 to 0.3 micron layer of single crystal silicon. Further methods include ion-implantation methods in which either hydrogen or oxygen ions are implanted either to form a buried oxide layer in the silicon wafer topped by Si, in the case of oxygen ion implantation, or to separate (exfoliate) a thin Si layer to bond to another Si wafer with an oxide layer, as in the case of hydrogen ion implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Manufacture of SOI structures by these methods is costly. The latter method involving hydrogen ion implantation has received some attention and has been considered advantageous over the former methods because the implantation energies required are less than 50% of that of oxygen ion implants and the dosage required is two orders of magnitude lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,176,528 discloses anodic bonding processes that produce SOI structures. The steps include: (i) exposing a silicon wafer surface to hydrogen ion implantation to create a bonding surface; (ii) bringing the bonding surface of the wafer into contact with a glass substrate; (iii) temperature and voltage to the wafer and the glass substrate to facilitate bonding therebetween (pressure may also be applied); (iv) cooling the structure to a common temperature; and (v) separating the glass substrate and a thin layer of silicon from the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">After the removal of a first thin layer of silicon (or other semiconductor material) from the donor semiconductor wafer in the SOI process, which may remove less than one micron, about 95% or more of the donor semiconductor wafer may still be available for further use. The re-use of a donor semiconductor wafer has a relatively significant impact on the cost to produce an SOI structure, particularly a large area SOI structure. Donor semiconductor wafer re-use—which may be a dominant factor impacting the process cost—defines how many times a given donor semiconductor wafer can be used during numerous bonding processes to produce SOI structure(s). The re-use factor is even more important when a large area SOI is being produced using separate semiconductor layer structures laterally disposed over a given glass substrate (so-called tiling). For such processes, it is desirable to re-use a given donor semiconductor wafer as many times as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">For re-use it is necessary to return a bonding surface of the donor semiconductor wafer to a relatively damage-free state—at least to a state indistinguishable from an un-used (prime surface) of a donor wafer. This has been done by removing a certain thickness of the donor semiconductor wafer, which is contaminated with ions and damaged due to the implantation and exfoliation (separation) processes, by conventional chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques. While CMP techniques are well documented and existing equipment may be readily obtained, there are a number of problems with the existing CMP technology in the context of semiconductor re-use in anodic bonding/exfoliation processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Conventional CMP techniques are expensive because, in the case of semiconductor re-use, multiple equipment set-ups are required. A given CMP set-up includes a rotating polishing pad (having certain abrasive characteristics), a slurry (also having certain abrasive characteristics), and a rotating chuck or head to press the semiconductor wafer against the polishing pad and slurry. In accordance with conventional CMP techniques, in order to obtain a semiconductor wafer with satisfactory surface characteristics in a re-use context, multiple polishing pads are needed (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,510,974). This requires either manual process steps to change the polishing pad on a given piece of equipment, or multiple pieces of equipment, each with a different polishing pad. Either approach adds cost to the manufacturing process and adversely impacts the commercial viability of the SOI structure and end-use application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Existing CMP polishing protocols call for aggressive removal of material, which increases the risk of depleting the thickness budget for each re-use cycle, and thus increases the risk of missing re-use cost objectives. Concurrently, such aggressive protocols increase the risk of breakage due to associated handling of much thinner (and likely more fragile) wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The conventional CMP protocols do not remove material uniformly across the surface of the donor semiconductor wafer. The state of the art for round semiconductor wafer surface non-uniformities (standard deviation/mean removal thickness) is typically 5-10% of the material thickness removed. As more of the semiconductor material is removed, the variation in the thickness correspondingly worsens. A related problem with conventional CMP processes is that they exhibit particularly poor results when non-round semiconductor wafers (e.g., those having sharp corners, such as rectangular wafers) are polished. Indeed, the aforementioned surface non-uniformities are amplified at the corners of the donor semiconductor wafer compared with those at the center thereof. Multiple re-use of the donor semiconductor wafer by such CMP protocols results in the premature end to a given wafer's re-use life because the surface geometry (e.g., near the corners) exceeds re-use functional limits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">For example, if 0.150 microns of actual damage needs to be removed from a bonding surface of a donor semiconductor wafer, then to be certain that the damaged and contaminated layer has been completely removed from the whole surface (taking into account the aforementioned non-uniform characteristics of the CMP protocols), at least 1.0 micron may be the target thickness for removal. Thus, over five times the thickness of the actual damage is removed in order to be sure that all the damage is removed. This is highly wasteful and has significant, negative cost implications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Although the manufacturing processes for making SOI structures are maturing, the cost of producing such structures and the final products employing them is driven in part by the ability to use (and re-use) donor semiconductor wafers efficiently. Accordingly, it is desirable to continue to advance the technologies associated with re-using donor semiconductor wafers, such as CMP, in order to control the cost of manufacturing SOI structures.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">For ease of presentation, the following discussion will at times be in terms of SOI structures. The references to this particular type of SOI structure are made to facilitate the explanation of the embodiments herein and are not intended to, and should not be interpreted in a limiting sense. The SOI abbreviation is used herein to refer to semiconductor-on-insulator structures in general, including, but not limited to, semiconductor-on-glass (SOG) structures, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures, and silicon-on-glass (SiOG) structures, which also encompasses silicon-on-glass-ceramic structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Embodiments of the donor semiconductor wafer re-use process described herein solve the problems with the conventional CMP techniques, such as repeatability, reliability and cost in connection with restoring donor semiconductor wafer surfaces (even of non-round, arbitrary geometry) for the purpose of producing multiple high quality semiconductor films from a given donor semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">It has been discovered that donor semiconductor wafer re-use as described above may be successfully implemented using CMP methodology if specific combinations of the CMP process parameters are established and/or varied. These parameters may include one or more of: polishing down force, polisher kinematics (e.g., platen and head speeds), process temperature, slurry characteristics (e.g., concentration, particle size, additives, and flow rate), polishing pad, method of restraining the polishing substrate, and cycle duration. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that such a CMP process may be implemented on existing polisher equipped with only one polishing platform and pad, thereby foregoing the need to acquire expensive, complex silicon polishing technology and related equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In this regard, embodiments described herein are directed to: removal of substantially all surface damage from the surface of interest incurred in previous ion implantation/exfoliation cycles; restoration of the surface of interest such that a semiconductor film produced therefrom cannot be distinguished from that of a pristine, prime semiconductor surface; control of material removal with each re-use resurfacing cycle to achieve a high number of re-uses and resultant cost efficiencies; uniform removal of material across the surface of interest, particularly on rectangular donor semiconductor wafer geometries; and achieving one or more (preferably all) of the above using a single polishing platform and pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">One or more embodiments disclosed herein may include the application of CMP methodology to a donor semiconductor wafer of arbitrary geometry (round, non-round, rectangular, etc.) to enable restoration of a surface previously exposed to ion implantation/exfoliation, thereby enabling repeated uses of the donor wafer in subsequent ion implantation/exfoliation processing. The CMP process employs three basic elements: a polishing pad in which the characteristics thereof (abrasiveness, composition, etc.) are selected to suit the polishing application; a particle-laden slurry (also application specific and suited to the choice of polishing medium); and the subject to be polished (in this context, a donor semiconductor wafer). The donor wafer is affixed to a chuck or head in such a way as to allow controlled pressing of a damaged surface thereof against the compliant polishing pad, which has been saturated with, and continuously fed by, a steady supply of the slurry. Substrate topography is reduced and global planarity established by simultaneous interfacial chemical and mechanical interactions which may be controlled by strategic choice of such consumables as polishing pad, slurry particle properties and associated chemistry including additives. Selection of the polishing pad, slurry particle chemistry, slurry concentration, slurry flow rate, slurry additives, polishing down force and kinematics, temperature, polishing duration, and method of restraining the polishing substrate are used in particular combinations to control material removal and effect surface restoration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">One or more embodiments feature a sequence of process steps in which polishing down force, slurry concentration, and slurry particle size are strategically decremented in steps separated by high volume deionized water rinses—all using a single polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In accordance with one or more embodiments disclosed herein, methods and apparatus for reducing surface damage of a semiconductor donor wafer include: (a) rotating a polishing pad, rotating the semiconductor donor wafer, applying a polishing slurry to the polishing pad, and pressing the semiconductor donor wafer and the polishing pad together; and (b) rotating the polishing pad and the semiconductor donor wafer, discontinuing the application of the polishing slurry, applying a rinsing fluid to the polishing pad, and pressing the semiconductor donor wafer and the polishing pad together. Step (a) followed by step (b) is carried out in sequence at least two times, and at least one of the following are reduced in at least two successive intervals of step (a): (i) a pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer and the polishing pad are pressed together, (ii) a mean particle size of an abrasive within the polishing slurry, and (iii) a concentration of the slurry in water and stabilizers.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">With reference to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, there is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> an SOI structure (in particular, an SOG structure) <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The SOG structure <b>100</b> includes an insulator substrate, such as a glass or glass ceramic substrate <b>102</b>, and a semiconductor layer <b>104</b>. The SOG structure <b>100</b> has application for use in displays, including organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), integrated circuits, photovoltaic devices, thin film transistor applications, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The semiconductor material of the layer <b>104</b> may be in the form of a substantially single-crystal material. The term “substantially” is used in describing the layer <b>104</b> to take account of the fact that semiconductor materials normally contain at least some internal or surface defects either inherently or purposely added, such as lattice defects or a few grain boundaries. The term substantially also reflects the fact that certain dopants may distort or otherwise affect the crystal structure of the semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">For the purposes of discussion, it is assumed that the semiconductor layer <b>104</b> is formed from silicon. It is understood, however, that the semiconductor material may be a silicon-based semiconductor or any other type of semiconductor, such as, the III-V, II-IV, II-IV-V, etc. classes of semiconductors. Examples of these materials include: silicon (Si), germanium-doped silicon (SiGe), silicon carbide (SiC), germanium (Ge), gallium arsenide (GaAs), GaP, and InP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is desirable to form many such SOG structures <b>100</b> in a manufacturing process, either for separate products, or for an integrated device in which multiple SOG structures are needed. In either case, one way to produce multiple SOG structures <b>100</b> is to cleave (separate or exfoliate) a number of thin exfoliation layers <b>122</b>A, <b>122</b>B, <b>122</b>C, etc. of semiconductor material from a donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> during a process in which the respective bonding surfaces <b>121</b> of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> are bonded to respective glass substrates <b>102</b>. After the removal (e.g. exfoliation, cleaving or separation) of a first exfoliation layer <b>122</b>A of semiconductor material from the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, a significant amount of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> (possibly 95% or more) is still available for further use. The re-use of a donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> has a relatively significant impact on the cost to produce a number of SOG structures <b>100</b>, particularly large area SOG structures. As will be discussed in more detail later herein, it is necessary to return a cleaved, exfoliated surface (and underlying damaged, contaminated layer) <b>121</b>A of the remaining portion of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> to a subsequent, suitable bonding surface <b>121</b>, having a relatively ion contamination and damage-free state. The subsequent bonding surface <b>121</b> is then used for a subsequent bonding and exfoliation process for the transfer and bonding of a second exfoliation layer <b>122</b>B to a second glass substrate <b>102</b>. In order to maximize the output from each donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, this “re-use” or “refresh” of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is repeated as many times as possible by refinishing the cleaved surface <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> for the transfer and bonding of second, third, fourth exfoliation layers <b>122</b>B, <b>122</b>C, <b>122</b>D, etc. to respective glass substrates <b>102</b>. The specific techniques used to refinish the cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A and make it ready for bonding and exfoliation may also have a significant impact on the overall cost to produce the SOG structures <b>100</b>. These techniques will be described in more detail later herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, which illustrate intermediate structures that may be formed in order to produce the SOG structure <b>100</b>. Turning first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bonding surface <b>121</b> of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is prepared, such as by polishing, cleaning, etc. to produce a relatively flat and uniform bonding surface <b>121</b> suitable for bonding to the glass or glass-ceramic substrate <b>102</b>. For the purposes of discussion, the semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be a substantially single crystal silicon wafer, although as discussed above any other suitable semiconductor material may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">An exfoliation layer <b>122</b> is created by subjecting the bonding surface <b>121</b> to one or more ion implantation processes to create a weakened region (diagrammatically illustrate by dashed line <b>126</b>) below the bonding surface <b>121</b> of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>. Although the embodiments described herein are not limited to any particular method of forming the exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, one suitable method dictates that the bonding surface <b>121</b> of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be subject to a hydrogen ion implantation process to at least initiate the creation of the weakened region <b>126</b> in the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>. The implantation energy may be adjusted using conventional techniques to achieve a general thickness of the exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, such as between about 300-500 nm. By way of example, hydrogen ion implantation may be employed, although other ions or multiples thereof may be employed, such as boron+hydrogen, helium+hydrogen, or other ions known in the literature for exfoliation. Again, any other known or hereinafter developed technique suitable for forming the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Regardless of the nature of the implanted ion species, the effect of implantation of ions into the weakened region <b>126</b> is the displacement of atoms in the crystal lattice from their regular locations. When the atom in the lattice is hit by an ion, the atom is forced out of position and a primary defect, a vacancy and an interstitial atom, is created, which is called a Frenkel pair. If the implantation is performed near room temperature, the components of the primary defect move and create many types of secondary defects, such as vacancy clusters, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the glass substrate <b>102</b> may be bonded to the bonding surface <b>121</b> of exfoliation layer <b>122</b> using any known or hereinafter developed technology. For example, the glass substrate <b>102</b> may be bonded to the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> using a thermal bonding process. Alternatively, the glass substrate <b>102</b> may be bonded to the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> using an electrolysis process (also referred to herein as an anodic bonding process). A basis for a suitable electrolysis bonding process may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,176,528, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Portions of this process are discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In an anodic bonding process, appropriate surface cleaning of the glass substrate <b>102</b> (and the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> if not done already) may be carried out. Thereafter, the intermediate structures are brought into direct or indirect contact to achieve the arrangement schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The resulting intermediate structure is thus a stack, including the bulk material layer of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, the exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, and the glass substrate <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Prior to or after the contact, the structure(s) comprising the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, the exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, and the glass substrate <b>102</b> are heated. The glass substrate <b>102</b> may be heated to a higher temperature than the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> and exfoliation layer <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The glass substrate <b>102</b> and the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be taken to a temperature within about +/−150 degrees C. of the strain point of the glass substrate <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Next, a voltage is applied across the intermediate assembly, for example with the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> at the positive electrode and the glass substrate <b>102</b> the negative electrode. Pressure may also be applied to press the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> against the glass substrate <b>102</b>. The intermediate assembly is held under the above conditions for some time (e.g., approximately 1 hour or less), the voltage is removed and the intermediate assembly is allowed to cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, prior to, during and/or after cooling the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> and the glass substrate <b>102</b> are separated, which may include some peeling if they have not already become completely free, to obtain a glass substrate <b>102</b> with the relatively thin exfoliation layer <b>122</b> formed of the semiconductor material of the donor semiconductor layer <b>120</b> bonded thereto. The separation of the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> may be accomplished via fracture of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> along the weakened region <b>126</b> due to thermal and internal pressure stresses. Alternatively or in addition, mechanical stresses or energy, such as water jet pressure or cutting (or other mechanical contact or cutting forces), tension or shear forces, or chemical etching may be used to initiate and/or facilitate the separation of the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> from the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The newly exposed cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may exhibit ion contamination and excessive surface roughness or damage from the implantation and exfoliation processes. By way of example, cleaved surface and underlying layer <b>121</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref> illustrate the depth of damage and ion contamination of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, which may be 200 nm or more. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates the surface roughness and morphology characteristics of the cleaved surface <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In accordance with one or more embodiments herein, the cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is subject to one or more CMP processing cycles over time to remove the damaged and ion contamination and produce a refreshed bonding surface <b>121</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) suitable for producing a further SOG structure <b>100</b>. It is contemplated that the steps of creating an exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, bonding the exfoliation layer <b>122</b> to a substrate <b>102</b>, separating the exfoliation layer <b>122</b>, and subsequent bonding surface refresh treatment—to repair the cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>—are repeated numerous times to utilize significant portions of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> to create respective exfoliation layers <b>122</b>A, <b>122</b>B, <b>122</b>C. etc., thereby reducing material costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a suitable system <b>200</b> is illustrated for carrying out CMP processing embodiments to remove the damaged cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A from the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>. The system includes a polishing platen <b>202</b>, a polishing pad <b>204</b>, and a chuck or head <b>206</b>. The polishing platen <b>202</b> rotates at a controlled rate in response to a shaft <b>208</b> and rotary union <b>210</b>. A suitable controllable source of rotational drive (not shown) provides the required rotational torque to the shaft <b>208</b>. The polishing platen <b>202</b> may contain an internal webbing or channels through which a heating/cooling fluid <b>212</b> may flow. For example, tempered water may flow at considerable volume (about 10-20 liters per minute) through the webbing in the platen. The temperature of the water may be controlled (such as to about 26° C.), such that a maximum polishing temperature may be maintained (such as not to exceed about 39° C.) at the surface of the polishing pad <b>204</b>. The temperature of the surface of the polishing pad <b>204</b> may be measured via an optical pyrometer (not shown) trained thereon throughout the polishing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The polishing pad <b>204</b> may be of any suitable construction, although it has been discovered that advantages may be achieved when it includes certain characteristics that will be discussed later herein. A source <b>214</b> of delivering a slurry to the polishing pad <b>204</b> is strategically located to deliver adjustable rates thereof. As will be discussed in more detail below, a rinsing liquid (such as deionized water) may also delivered through the source <b>214</b>, or through a separate independent source (not shown), to the polishing pad <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is held by the chuck or head <b>206</b> and is pressed thereby against the polishing pad <b>204</b> during operation of the equipment <b>200</b>. The head <b>206</b> may also rotate via appropriate motor and linkage (not shown). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be of rectangular cross-section. The head <b>206</b> may include a rigid block <b>230</b> to which a composite material template <b>232</b> is mounted. The composite material template <b>232</b> may include a capillary-action pad bottom layer (e.g., a suede-based finish) and a plastic or fiberglass top layer. The form factor of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> (e.g. a rectangular relief) is machined through the top layer exposing the bottom layer. By way of example, the material template <b>232</b> may feature a 15-inch diameter, 0.170-inch nominal thickness disc into which a rectangular pocket with corner relief has been machined through the top layer. By way of example, the disc may be a material obtained from Franklin Fibre-Lamitex Corporation, such as a two-layer material with a capillary action bottom layer and a plastic or fiberglass top layer. The construction of the material template <b>232</b> may be such that the recessed area is formed in a size and shape corresponding closely to the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> when the two composite layers are joined with one another. When the recessed area of the material template <b>232</b> is wetted with clean deionized water thereby wetting the capillary action bottom layer, and the backside of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is gently pressed into the recess against the wet bottom layer. Capillary action holds the wafer <b>120</b> vertically in place in the recessed area in the direction that the wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together. The sides of the recessed area in the upper layer serve to restrain the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> laterally in the axis of rotation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In order to achieve desirable results, including proper surface roughness, proper uniformity, proper material removal, and low cost (in the context of donor semiconductor wafer re-use in an exfoliation process), it is critical that the CMP process be carefully controlled and that processing parameters be carefully selected. This is not a matter of routine optimization of parameters and predictable results. Rather, it has been discovered through painstaking experimentation and statistical analysis that certain processing parameters should be maintained and others varied in a cyclical process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In view of the above, the equipment <b>200</b> was employed in a series of experiments to determine proper cyclical parameters. CMP process parameters that have been found to influence the planarity, surface quality, and material removal rate of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> include polishing down force (a pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together), flow rates and types of slurry components, kinematics (polisher platen <b>202</b> and head <b>206</b> rotational speeds as well as relative directions), diluent flow rate, process temperature control, duration of polishing, selection of polishing pad <b>204</b> type, and method of wafer <b>120</b> mounting and restraint during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In the context of the re-use of a donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> having been subjected to ion implantation and exfoliation, process variables were tested by application of a statistically designed experimentation methodology. A broad screening of experiments were carried out in which six (6) treatment effects influential in material removal and surface quality were evaluated over wide ranges. Per “design of experiments” (DOE) statistical methodology, a highly fractionated matrix of process parameters were tested. Specifically, two blocks of experiments were run with two different pad types, augmented with strategically placed center points. The experiments were designed to isolate those polishing process parameters that most influenced material removal and surface roughness, two responses believed crucial to successful semiconductor refresh processing. The matrix of process parameters are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, where the parameters are labeled P<b>1</b> for standard order, P<b>2</b> for run order, P<b>3</b> for center point, P<b>4</b> for down force (psi), P<b>5</b> for slurry flow rate (ml/min), P<b>6</b> for platen speed (rpm), P<b>7</b> for head speed (rpm), P<b>8</b> for DI water flow rate (ml/min), and P<b>9</b> for pad type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Statistical analysis of the results of the experiments run using the matrix parameters listed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> were carried out using commercially available software. The analysis revealed the graphical data illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, which are half-normal plots of percentage along the Y-axis and the absolute standard effect of the parameters along the X-axis. The fitted line in each graph represents substantially zero statistical effect by a given parameter. In other words, if a data point falls on the line, the parameter that the data point represents has no influence on the results of the system <b>200</b>. Data points deviating from the line are considered statistically significant in that the system parameters that such data points represent have a significant effect on the results of the system <b>200</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a half-normal plot for material removal and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a half-normal plot for surface roughness. With specific reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, one can see that parameters A (down force), C (platen speed), D (head speed), and F (polishing pad type) had significant effect on material removal, while the other parameters did not. With specific reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, one can see that parameters A (down force), B (slurry flow), C (platen speed), and (polishing pad type); in particular, A (down force), C (platen speed) and F (polishing pad type), had significant effect on surface roughness, while the other parameters did not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">From these experiments and statistical analyses, it has been discovered that material removal and surface roughness were strongly influenced by choice of polishing pad <b>204</b>, level of polishing down force, and platen speed. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the choice of polishing pad <b>204</b> and the speed of the platen <b>202</b> interacted constructively, where the two responses of interest were concerned, but destructively in the case of polishing down force. This situation has led to compromises where down force is concerned and a cyclical, sequential approach to material removal to achieve the aforementioned re-use goals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">As it is desirable to employ only one polishing pad <b>204</b> during the entirety of the material removal and surface roughness processing in order to achieve a simple and efficient process, special consideration has been given to its properties. In general, polishing pads used in CMP processes are polymeric, but vary widely in such physical properties as hardness, compressibility, permeability, nap thickness, pore structure, surface contour, and rebound rate, leading to varying performance characteristics. The polishing pad <b>204</b> is a critical element in the present CMP embodiments because, by means of its pore structure, it acts as a conduit for the near simultaneous distribution of slurry chemicals and expulsion of resulting polishing by-products. The selection of polishing pad product for specific applications of CMP is therefore critical to the achievement of desired process ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In view of the considerable experimentation and statistical analysis, it has been discovered that advantages may be achieved when the polishing pad <b>204</b> is of the felt-based, polyurethane impregnated type. The polishing pad <b>204</b> may be of about 1.25 mm nominal thickness, relatively low compressibility by pad standards (such as about 2.9% compressibility), considerable hardness (about 85 Asker C durometer), and low air permeability resistance. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the surface <b>220</b> of the polishing pad <b>204</b> that engages the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> is preferably deeply grooved or channeled <b>222</b>. By way of example, the grooves <b>222</b> may be in a perpendicular, cross-hatched arrangement in a Cartesian coordinate plane. It has been found that advantageous results may be obtained when the grooves <b>222</b> are about 1 mm or more deep and the cross-hatching is on the order of about 21 mm×21 mm. A suitable polishing pad <b>204</b> may be obtained from Rohm-Haas Incorporated, presently sold as SUBA 840 PAD 48″D PJ; XA25 (supplier material number 10346084). Alternative patterns for the groove <b>222</b> are possible, such as diamond-shaped grooves, spiral-shaped grooves, radially and/or circumferentially extending grooves, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As for other processing parameters, the CMP process is conducted in sequential stages, where polishing down force, slurry concentration, and slurry particle size are strategically decremented in a sequence of steps executed on a single polishing pad <b>204</b> to remove damage and ion contamination born of implantation and exfoliation processes and restore the damaged, cleaved surface (and underlying layer) <b>121</b>A of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>. By using a single pad (or just 2 pads), the entire process can be automated providing significant reductions in cycle time and labor spent on changing pads compared to the multi-pad labor intensive conventional CMP processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">One or more embodiments of the CMP process includes the primary steps of: (a) rotating the polishing pad <b>204</b> (via the platen <b>202</b>), rotating the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> (via the head <b>206</b>), applying the polishing slurry to the polishing pad <b>204</b> (via the source <b>214</b>), and pressing the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> together; and (b) a rinsing step, where the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> continue rotation and contact, but the application of the polishing slurry is discontinued in favor of applying a rinsing fluid to the polishing pad <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The CMP sequence may be initiated (a startup stage) by executing an initial “ramp-up” step (a) process, in which the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> are each rotated (e.g., both clockwise), applying the polishing slurry to the polishing pad <b>204</b>, and pressing the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> together. During startup, the polishing pad <b>204</b> is wetted and saturated with a colloidal silica slurry with a mean particle size of about 60-80 nm (such as 70 nm), an overall dilution (as dispensed onto the pad <b>204</b>) of about 30:1-50:1, such as about 40:1 in deionized water and chemical stabilizers, and a pH in the 8.0-9.0 range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The flow rate of the slurry should be selected to accomplish the polishing objectives for the given parameters of the process and system <b>200</b>. Such parameters include, for example, the size of the polishing platen <b>202</b>, the size of the polishing pad <b>204</b>, and/or the surface area of the cleaved surface <b>121</b>A. Indeed, a relatively small diameter platen <b>202</b> and polishing pad <b>204</b>, such as those found on laboratory-scale machines require far less slurry than relatively larger diameter platens <b>202</b> and polishing pads <b>204</b>, typically associated with industrial-scale polishers. Further, the surface characteristics (e.g., the groove pattern, frequency, and groove depth) of the polishing pad <b>204</b> may significantly affect the minimum slurry flow rate. Indeed, deep and/or high concentrations of grooves in the polishing pad <b>204</b> tend to channel significantly more slurry away from the polishing zone as compared with shallow and/or low concentrations of grooves. As an alternative or addition to employing higher or lower flow rates of slurry, increasing or decreasing an additional, separate flow of deionized water may be employed. It is contemplated that the flow rate of the slurry should fall in the range of 250-2500 ml/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">A suitable slurry product may be obtained from Nalco, part number 2360 colloidal silica polishing slurry. The platen <b>202</b> (and thus the polishing pad <b>204</b>) rotational speed may be ramped to values of about 50-70 rpm, while the polishing head <b>206</b> (and thus the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>) rotational speed may be ramped to about 15-25 rpm. The down force (the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together) may be ramped to a moderate level of about 10-20 psi. The startup stage may last about 30 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The startup described above may transition seamlessly into a substantial or bulk material removal stage of considerable duration (e.g., about 200-300 seconds, or 200-600 seconds, such as about 240 seconds). For example, this may represent a “first” polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>) conducted at the process settings described in the startup stage above. In this stage, exfoliation damage may be removed completely and a new surface established with improved roughness level. Alkaline components of the reactive slurry chemistry initially attack the cleaved surface of the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, thereby breaking it down and forming hydrated silicate by-products. Polishing down force acts to press the wafer <b>120</b> uniformly against the conformal polishing pad <b>204</b>, while mechanical action of the rotation acts with the slurry particles to remove polishing by-products and expose new semiconductor material for renewed chemical attack. This cycle repeats rapidly and continuously until desired amount of material removal is accomplished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Intermediate studies conducted on this stage of the CMP indicate that a surface roughness of approximately 4.5 to 5 Å rms (as measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) is established under these polishing conditions. More chemically aggressive (high pH) silica slurries (both fumed and colloidal particle based) such as Nalco 2358 or Fujimi Planerlite 4219 have been successfully employed in the startup and first stages as well, with a reduced process time and somewhat reduced surface quality, e.g. a somewhat rougher surface. Thus, the bulk material removal may be performed faster with a more aggressive polishing, but this achieved at the cost of a reduced surface quality that may require a longer final smoothing or buffing operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In a next stage, a rinsing step (c) is conducted, where the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> continue rotation and contact, but the application of the polishing slurry is discontinued in favor of applying deionized water to the polishing pad <b>204</b>. The flow rate of the deionized water may be on the order of about 5600 ml/min. During this rinsing stage, the down force may be significantly reduced as compared with the prior polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>). For example, the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together may be between about 1-3 pounds per square inch, which is about 70%-90% lower than during the earlier polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>). The rotational speeds of the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be maintained at about 50-70 rpm, and about 15-25 rpm, respectively. By way of example, this rinsing step (b) may be conducted for about 20-50 seconds, such as about 30 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In general, the CMP protocol calls for a polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>) followed by a rinsing step (c) in sequence at least two times, where at least one of the following parameters are reduced in at least two successive intervals of polishing steps (b): (i) a pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together, (ii) a mean particle size of an abrasive within the polishing slurry, and (iii) a concentration of the slurry in water and stabilizers. Preferably, all intervals of polishing steps (b) and rinsing steps (c) are carried out without changing the polishing pad <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">By way of example, in a next or second stage, a smoothing operation may be conducted in which another (or “second”) polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>) is carried out. In this second polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>), the down force is elevated as compared with the prior rinsing step (c), but the down force is reduced as compared with that of the first polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>). For example, the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together may be reduced to about 5-15 pounds per square inch (such as 12 psi) during this second polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>), which is about 25% lower as compared with the first polishing step (b<sub>1</sub>). The rotational speeds of the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be maintained at about 50-70 rpm, and about 15-25 rpm, respectively. In this smoothing polishing step, the same colloidal silica slurry (mean particle size of about 70 nm and about 40:1 overall dilution in deionized water and chemical stabilizers) may be employed. By way of example; this polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>) may be conducted for about 150-220 seconds, such as about 180 seconds. The reduction in polishing down force improves surface roughness. Intermediate studies conducted on this smoothing polishing step indicate that a surface roughness of approximately 3.6 to 4.0 Å (as measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) is established.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In a next stage, another rinsing step (c), substantially similar to the earlier rinsing step may be conducted. The polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> continue rotation and contact, and application of the deionized water to the polishing pad <b>204</b> is conducted. The same, reduced down force of about 1-3 psi may be employed as compared with the prior, second polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>). By way of example, this rinsing step (c) may also be conducted for about 30 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In a next stage, a final or “buff” polishing operation may be conducted in which another (or “third”) polishing step (b<sub>3</sub>) is carried out. The down force is elevated as compared with the prior rinsing step (c), but the down force is reduced as compared with those of both the first and second polishing steps (b<sub>1</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>). For example, the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together may be reduced to about 1-5 pounds per square inch (such as 3 psi) during this third, polishing step (b<sub>3</sub>), which is about 65-85% lower as compared with the second polishing step (b<sub>2</sub>). The rotational speeds of the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> may be maintained at about 50-70 rpm, and about 15-25 rpm, respectively. In this buff step, a substantially reduced particle size of the colloidal silica slurry is employed as compared with the first and/or second polishing steps (b<sub>1</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>). For example, a mean particle size of between about 30-40 nm (such as about 35 nm) is employed, which is between about 40%-60% smaller as compared with the earlier polishing steps (b<sub>1</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>). By way of example, a suitable slurry product may be obtained from Fujimi Corporation, namely Glanzox 3950 (a finishing slurry product containing 4.5% by weight high purity colloidal silica of 35 nm average particle size). In addition, a substantially reduced concentration of the colloidal silica slurry is employed as compared with the first and/or second polishing steps (b<sub>1</sub>) and (b<sub>2</sub>). For example, the concentration may be on the order of between about 600:1-1000:1 overall dilution in deionized water and chemical stabilizers, which is between about 1000%-3000% lower as compared with at least one of the earlier polishing steps (b<sub>1</sub>) or (b<sub>2</sub>). By way of example, this buff polishing step (b<sub>3</sub>) may be conducted for about 150-220 seconds, such as about 180 seconds. Intermediate studies conducted on this process step indicate that a surface roughness approaching 3.0 Å rms, such as between 3.3 to 3.5 Å (as measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) is established under these polishing conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In a next stage, another rinsing step (c), substantially similar to the earlier rinsing steps may be conducted to cleanse the polishing surfaces (both pad <b>204</b> and wafer <b>120</b>) of slurry components employed in the preceding steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Optional additional processing stages may be employed to further improve the result. For example, another interval of rinsing step (c) may be conducted, where: (i) the interval lasts between about 50-70 seconds (such as 60 seconds), (ii) the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together is between about 1-3 pounds per square inch, (iii) speeds of rotation of the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> are between about 25-45 rpm (such as 35 rpm), and (iv) the rinsing fluid is a rinsing agent. The rinsing agent may include a secondary chemistry (e.g., lower pH—typically neutral but acidic chemistry may also be employed), including chemical components that act to reduce surface tension between the wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b>. This chemistry passivates the wafer <b>120</b>, creating a hydrophylic surface conducive to downstream cleaning. By way of example, a Rodelene rinse agent composed of silica, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol in deionized water manufactured by Rohm-Haas Electronic Materials CMP Incorporated may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">A final rinsing step (c) may be conducted, where: (i) the interval lasts between about 5-20 seconds, (ii) the pressure at which the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> and the polishing pad <b>204</b> are pressed together is minimized, (iii) speeds of rotation of the polishing pad <b>204</b> and the semiconductor donor wafer <b>120</b> are between about 25-45 rpm, and (iv) the rinsing fluid is water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref>, <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C, and <b>12</b>D results of the aforementioned CMP processes were observed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates the lack of damage of the donor surface <b>121</b> of an implanted and exfoliated donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> that has been subjected to the CMP refresh processes described herein. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates the surface roughness and morphology characteristics of a surface <b>121</b> (measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) of a donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b> that has been subjected to exfoliation followed by the CMP re-use processes described herein. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> illustrates the surface roughness and morphology characteristics of a surface <b>121</b> (measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) of a pristine donor semiconductor wafer <b>120</b>, not yet having been subject to ion implantation/exfoliation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> illustrates the surface roughness and morphology characteristics of a surface <b>121</b> (measured by AFM on a 5 μm×5 μm image area) of a prime donor semiconductor wafer that has not been subjected to exfoliation, but has been subjected to a CMP re-use process in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">It has been demonstrated that further surface roughness improvement, including complete restoration of a previously exfoliated surface to a prime surface, is readily attained when the embodiments described in this invention are applied using a finishing pad.
