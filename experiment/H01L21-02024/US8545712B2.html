<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a U.S. National Phase Application under 35 USC 371 of International Application PCT/JP2008/066412 filed Sep. 11, 2008.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing semiconductor wafers in which front and back surfaces of the semiconductor wafers are simultaneously polished with a double-side polishing machine that includes: a carrier for accommodating unprocessed semiconductor wafers; and an upper press platen and a lower press platen for sandwiching the carrier.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Increase in integration in semiconductor devices throughout recent years has invited reduction in line width of the semiconductor devices. In manufacturing such semiconductor devices with steppers, front surfaces of semiconductor wafers (i.e., exposure surfaces) are required to be highly flat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The standard for evaluating the flatness has been hitherto GBIR (global back ideal range), a global standard, and SBIR (site back ideal range), a local standard. In recent years, semiconductor wafers are evaluated based on SFQR (site front-surface referenced least squares/range), a standard of the flatness in which focusing capabilities of the stepper over the whole segment regions of semiconductor wafer surfaces are considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">According to a known proposal for a method of manufacturing semiconductor wafers capable of enhancing such SFQR, the relationship between the thickness of the carrier and the thickness of an unprocessed semiconductor wafer is defined during polishing by the double-side polishing machine, and a predetermined polishing allowance is secured, thereby enhancing SFQR (e.g., see Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Patent Document 1: JP-A-2000-235941 (paragraph [0006])</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problems to Be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Ideally, every region in one piece of semiconductor wafer exhibits its required flatness. However, practically speaking, when a semiconductor wafer is polished with a double-side polishing machine or the like, the semiconductor wafer exhibits a phenomenon called edge roll off (ERO) at its edge region due to a difference in a polishing pressure between the central region and the edge region. Accordingly, a portion of the semiconductor wafer measured from the edge toward the center by a predetermined dimension does not exhibit the flatness level accorded with the demanded quality, so that the portion should be wastefully discarded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">With the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, it is difficult to improve ERO while maintaining the flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">An aspect of the invention provides a method of manufacturing semiconductor wafers capable of enhancing utilization of edge regions of the semiconductor wafers while maintaining high flatness of the semiconductor wafers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In the first stage polishing, the same polishing pad was employed for the front and back surfaces. The employed polishing pad was an urethane pad.</div>

3. Evaluation Results and Consideration
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0061">(1) Evaluation of Edge Roll Off (ERO) at Edge Region</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In Example and Comparative, the difference Gap between the thickness of the unprocessed semiconductor wafers S and the thickness of the carriers <b>50</b> and the allowances of both surfaces of the semiconductor wafers were changed in a stepwise manner, and the relationship therebetween shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was resultantly obtained.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">As appreciated from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the region A in which Gap was set at less than 5 μm and the allowance was set at 0 to 5 μm or more exhibited a quite favorable ERO value.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The examination of the relationship between the thickness difference Gap and the allowance produced the result shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Specifically, when Gap is set at 0 or less and the allowance is set at more than 5 μm, the center of the semiconductor wafer S tends to be polished more than the other portions while the periphery remains non-grinded, as represented by the shape SH<b>1</b>. Thus, GBIR, SBIR and SFQR are numerically deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">On the other hand, when Gap is set at 5 μm or more and the allowance is reduced, the edge portion of the semiconductor wafer S is polished more than the other portions while the center is little polished, as represented by the shape SH<b>2</b>. Thus, GBIR and SBIR are numerically deteriorated. Accordingly, by setting Gap at 5 μm (more than 0) and setting the allowance at 5 μm or less, the wafer can be flatly polished as represented by the shape SH<b>3</b>. Thus, all of GBIR, SBIR and SFQR are satisfied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">(3) Conclusion</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In sum, based on the results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the conditions capable of satisfying all of ERO, GBIR, SBIR and SFQR are: to set Gap in a range of more than 0 μm to less than 5 μm; and to set the allowance of both surfaces to be totalized to be in a range of 5 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">By conducting the polishing under the above polishing conditions, semiconductor wafers S capable of satisfying all of ERO, GBIR, SBIR and SFQR can be manufactured.</div>
