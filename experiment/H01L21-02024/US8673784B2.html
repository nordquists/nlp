<heading>EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a process chart illustrating a method for producing a silicon epitaxial wafer, to which an embodiment of the present invention is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Describing at first one example of a pre-process for slicing step A, using Czochralski pulling up method, a p-type silicon single crystal ingot is produced which has the main axis orientation of &lt;100&gt; and the diameter of 305 mm, and this ingot is peripherally ground into the diameter of 300 mm and then subjected to notch forming thereafter being cut into a plurality of blocks with electrical resistance of 5 to 10 mΩcm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Note that, as the main axis orientation of the silicon single crystal, other orientations, such as &lt;110&gt;, may be applicable alternatively to &lt;100&gt;. Also note that, as the diameter of the wafer, other diameters, such as 200 mm and 450 mm may be applicable alternatively to 300 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In the slicing step A, each of the above blocks is sliced using a wire saw to provide wafer-like substrates with a certain thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Sliced wafer substrates are subjected to double side grinding in lapping step B thereby to ensure a certain degree of flatness. In the lapping step B, the wafer substrates are interposed between upper and lower grinding surface plates of a double side grinding machine, and both surfaces, i.e. the front surface and the back surface of each wafer substrate are ground while supplying slurry containing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Wafer substrates having been flattened to a certain degree in the lapping step B are put into etching step C, and grinding damages generated on the surfaces are removed therefrom. Note that wafer substrates may be sent to a chamfering step after the lapping step B, and the shapes of outer faces thereof may be adjusted using grinding stone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In the producing method according to the present embodiment, first polishing step D is provided which polishes, before epitaxial growth step F, at least front surfaces of the wafer substrates having been completed the etching step C, only by an abrasive cloth and using slurry not containing abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In this first polishing step D, only the front surface of each wafer substrate may be polished, or otherwise both the front surface and the back surface of each wafer substrate may be concurrently polished. In the case of concurrently polishing both surfaces, the wafer substrate is interposed between upper and lower polishing surface plates of a double side polishing apparatus, to which hard polishing pads are attached, and both surfaces of the wafer substrate are polished at the same time under the condition of no abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The polishing amount in this first polishing step D is within the range of 5 to 30 μm, for example. This first polishing step D improves the flatness of wafer substrates and suppresses polishing damages due to abrasive grains from occurring because the polishing is performed without abrasive grains, and defects to be subsequently formed in the epitaxial layer would be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Note that, after the etching step C and before the first polishing step D, polishing with abrasive grains may be performed to polish the surfaces of the wafer substrates using slurry containing abrasive grains, however, in this case, in order to remove polishing damages due to abrasive grains, it is preferred that the polishing amount in the first polishing step D is set to be 100 nm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">After completing the first polishing step D, the wafer substrates are cleaned up to remove polishing residue (cleaning step E) thereafter being sent to the epitaxial growth step F.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In the epitaxial growth step F, before supplying reactive gases into an epitaxial reactor furnace in which wafer substrates are set, halogenated gas may be supplied into the reactor furnace to remove oxidized films having formed on the surfaces of the wafer substrates. Alternatively to the method of etching by supplying halogenated gas into the epitaxial reactor furnace, the cleaning step E may be provided therein with a wet etching step where etching liquid for the oxidized films is dropped onto the wafer substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In the epitaxial growth step F, the wafer substrates are set on susceptors in the epitaxial reactor furnace and the reactive gases are supplied thereby to form epitaxial layers on the surfaces of the wafer substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Wafer substrates having formed thereon with epitaxial layers are sent to second polishing step G to be subjected to finish polishing. Although the second polishing step G is enough to be a step at which at least the front surface of each wafer substrate is subjected to the finish polishing, the second polishing step G according to the present embodiment involves double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> and subsequent single side mirror polishing step G<b>2</b>. Hereinafter, the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> and the single side mirror polishing step G<b>2</b> will be described as one example of the second polishing step G, but the present invention is not intended to be limited to this.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b>, a double side polishing apparatus and a polishing method as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>) may be employed. Hereinafter, one example of such polishing apparatus used in the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> will be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front elevational view illustrating one example of the polishing apparatus, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view from line A-A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The polishing apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises: a circular lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> supported horizontally; a circular upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b> facing the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> from above; a sun gear <b>3</b> positioned at the inside of the circular lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b>; and a ring-like internally-toothed gear <b>4</b> positioned at the outside of the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b>. In addition, reference numeral <b>5</b> denotes a cylinder, reference numeral <b>6</b> denotes a joint, reference numeral <b>7</b> denotes a tank for polishing liquid, reference numeral <b>8</b> denotes carriers, and reference numeral <b>9</b> denotes holes for being set therein with wafer substrates <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Facing surfaces of the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> and the upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b> are, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>), attached thereto pads (abrasive clothes) <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> each obtained by impregnating urethane resin into nonwoven fabric cloth, or pads (abrasive clothes) <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> comprised of urethane foams etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">When performing the polishing of wafer substrates <b>10</b>, in the status where the upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b> is lifted up, a plurality of carriers <b>8</b> are set on the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> and the wafer substrates <b>10</b> are set into holes <b>9</b> of each carrier <b>8</b>. The upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b> is then caused to move down to apply a predetermined pressing force to each wafer substrate <b>10</b>. In this status, while polishing liquid is supplied between the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> and the upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b>, the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b>, the upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b>, the sun gear <b>3</b>, and the internally-toothed gear <b>4</b> are caused to rotate in predetermined directions with predetermined speeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">This allows a sun-and-planet motion to run where the plurality of carriers <b>8</b> revolve around the sun gear <b>3</b> while each rotating between the lower polishing surface plate <b>1</b> and the upper polishing surface plate <b>2</b>. The wafer substrates <b>10</b> held by each carrier <b>8</b> are contacted and rubbed with the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> in the polishing liquid, and both the upper and the lower surfaces are concurrently polished. Polishing condition is set such that both surfaces of each wafer substrates <b>10</b> are evenly polished and the plurality of wafer substrates <b>10</b> are evenly polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>) are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating polishing statuses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the conventional polishing technique which involves a polishing step using carriers <b>8</b> thinner than wafer substrates <b>10</b>, pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> are concentrated at outer edges A of the wafer substrates <b>10</b>, one of which is denoted by symbol A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>), thereby causing edge-roll-off to occur in each wafer substrate <b>10</b> as a result. In addition, according to the polishing technique described in Jpn. Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-254299, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>b</i>), a method is employed in which the pressures to be concentrated at outer edges A are distributed toward the vicinity of wafer substrates <b>10</b> and the carriers <b>8</b> by enlarging the thickness dimensions of the carriers <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In contrast, according to the polishing method of the present embodiment, by closely arranging the holes <b>9</b> in the planar arrangement within each carrier <b>8</b> to concentrate the locations of the wafer substrates <b>10</b> toward the center of each carrier <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>c</i>), the polishing pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> are allowed to be distributed toward adjacent wafer substrates <b>10</b> arranged close to each other as denoted by symbol B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>c</i>). Consequently, disadvantages in the conventional technique are suppressed that the productivity may be deteriorated due to decreasing of the polishing rate and that the control of the thickness of carriers may be required, etc, while on the other hand, edge-roll-off of the wafer substrates <b>10</b> may be prevented from occurring at the outer edge portions thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">This is considered as being due to that the distances among the wafer substrates <b>10</b> are made smaller in the status of eliminating the influence from the deformation of carriers <b>8</b> by the wafer substrates <b>10</b> during polishing, etc. Consequently, the concentration of polishing pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> on the surfaces of the polishing surface plates <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to the wafer substrates <b>10</b> is suppressed from occurring in the vicinity of the position where adjacent wafer substrates <b>10</b> come to be most close to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">During operation of the polishing, at the position between a wafer substrate <b>10</b> and another wafer substrate <b>10</b>, due to the difference in thickness between the wafer substrates <b>10</b> and the carrier <b>8</b>, a status is provided where the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> on the surfaces of the polishing surface plates having flexibility are deformed to outstand toward the carrier <b>8</b> from the height (the position in the thickness direction) at the planar position of each wafer substrate <b>10</b>. For this reason, the pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> may be concentrated at edge portions of the wafer substrates <b>10</b> thereby to increase the polishing amount at the edge portions of the wafer substrates <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">According to the polishing method of the present embodiment, however, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>c</i>), by making smaller the distance between the wafer substrates <b>10</b> (distance between the holes <b>9</b>), the deformation amount of the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> are allowed to be decreased in the vicinity of the position where adjacent wafer substrates <b>10</b> are close to each other. Consequently, the present embodiment allows the pressure concentration at the outer edge portions of the wafer substrates <b>10</b> to be alleviated in the vicinity of the outer edge portions of the wafer substrates <b>10</b>. As a result, the occurrence of edge-roll-off of the wafer substrates <b>10</b> may be reduced at the outer edge portions thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">This enables to easily and appropriately perform the polishing to a predetermined amount and to easily perceive the ending point of polishing, and to avoid the polishing pressure degradation to the wafer substrates <b>10</b> due to the decreasing of the pressure from the polishing surface plates to the carriers <b>8</b> even if during the latter half of the polishing step thereby to prevent the operation time efficiency/polishing efficiency from deteriorating, and also prevents the carriers <b>8</b> from being polished thereby to obtain long life-time thereof, and additionally avoids the flatness deterioration and the like by preventing the occurrence of edge-roll-off thereby enabling to produce the wafer substrates <b>10</b> having high flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Moreover, during the polishing operation, in the vicinity of the border, as the outer edge portion of each wafer substrate <b>10</b>, between the wafer substrate <b>10</b> and the carrier <b>8</b>, due to the difference in thickness between the wafer substrate <b>10</b> being polished and the carrier <b>8</b>, the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> on the surfaces of the polishing surface plates having flexibility are deformed to outstand toward the carrier <b>8</b> from the height (the position in the thickness direction) at the planar position of the wafer substrate <b>10</b>. Consequently, the pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> may be concentrated in the vicinity of the edge portion of the wafer substrate <b>10</b> along the entire length of the outer edge portion of the wafer substrate <b>10</b>, thereby to possibly cause the occurrence of the edge-roll-off of the wafer substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">According to the polishing method of the present embodiment, however, through decreasing the distances among the wafer substrates <b>10</b> to be subjected to the double side polishing and causing the wafer substrates <b>10</b> to be close to one another, it is enabled to approach the status where the wafer substrates <b>10</b> positioned in three holes <b>9</b> within one carrier <b>8</b> are polished as if they are of one wafer substrate <b>10</b>. This allows to limit the length where the stress concentration occurs relative to the entire outer edge length of one wafer substrate <b>10</b>, that is, to reduce the area where the polishing condition within the outer edge portion of the wafer substrate <b>10</b> becomes to be significant because the pressures from the abrasive clothes <b>15</b> and <b>25</b> on the surfaces of the polishing surface plates <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> having flexibility are concentrated at the outer edge portion of the wafer substrate <b>10</b> due to the difference in thickness between the wafer substrate <b>10</b> and the carrier <b>8</b>. Consequently, the polishing pressure concentration is allowed to be alleviated for the entire length of the edge portion of one wafer substrate <b>10</b> at the time of completing the polishing, and the occurrence of the edge-roll-off along the outer edge portion of each wafer substrate <b>10</b> is also allowed to be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Although the depicted example employs the configuration involving three carriers <b>8</b>, other number thereof may also be applicable, and other than this, any configuration of a part of the polishing apparatus may also be applicable so long as the arrangement of the holes <b>9</b> or the wafer substrates <b>10</b> within each carrier <b>8</b> complies with the above constitution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> of the second polishing step G, it is preferred that the polishing amount for the back surface of a silicon epitaxial wafer substrate is equal to or more than the polishing amount for the front surface. For example, it is preferred that the polishing amount for the front surface of a wafer substrate is within the range of 0.01 to 0.1 μm, and the polishing amount for the back surface is within the range of 0.1 to 1.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In the subsequent single side mirror polishing step G<b>2</b>, the front surface of the wafer substrate is subjected to a mirror polishing. The polishing amount in the mirror polishing is, for example, 0.01 to 0.2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As described above, according to the method for producing a silicon epitaxial wafer in the present embodiment, the flatness of the wafer substrate is ensured by the first polishing step D to be performed before the epitaxial growth step F, and epitaxial defects may be reduced because polishing damages scarcely occurs due to the polishing not using abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">On the other hand, according to the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> to be performed after the epitaxial growth step F, the haze level of the surface of a wafer is improved. At the same time, the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> after the epitaxial growth may remove hitting flaws caused by susceptors in the epitaxial reactor furnace, which may occur on the back surface of the wafer, and also remove the depositions onto the back surface, thereby suppressing the degradation of flatness and/or the occurrence of particles due to such flaws and depositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Moreover, the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> after the epitaxial growth allows the polishing amount of the wafer surfaces to be small as much as possible to the extent of removing oxidized layers on the surfaces, thereby maintaining the thickness of the epitaxial layers on the surfaces to be even.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The upper of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts four silicon wafers produced by the production method according to the present embodiment as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein an average of six epitaxial defects per one silicon wafer is observed. In contrast, the lower of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts four silicon wafers as comparative examples by using slurry containing abrasive grains in the first polishing step D as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein an average of 220 epitaxial defects per one silicon wafer is observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">It is to be noted that the embodiments as explained above are described to facilitate understanding of the present invention and are not described to limit the present invention. Therefore, it is intended that the elements disclosed in the above embodiments include all design changes and equivalents to fall within the technical scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">For example, although the double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> is provided after the epitaxial growth step F in the above embodiments, this double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> may be omitted in the present invention. More specifically, it is enough to polish at least the front surface of a silicon single crystal substrate using slurry not containing abrasive grains in the first polishing step D and thereafter to perform epitaxial growth on that surface, and the subsequent double side concurrently polishing step G<b>1</b> may thus be omitted. This allows for further improving the productivity.</div>
