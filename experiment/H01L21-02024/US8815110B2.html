<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This patent application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/462,638, filed Sep. 16, 2009.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Silicon wafers used in electronic devices are typically prepared from a single crystal silicon ingot that is first sliced into thin wafers using a diamond saw, lapped to improve flatness, and etched to remove subsurface damage caused by lapping. The silicon wafers are then typically polished in a two-step process to remove nanotopography caused by etching and to achieve the desired thickness before the wafers are acceptable for use in electronic devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In the first polishing step, a high removal rate is required, and ideally the nanotopography would not be worsened during this step. Nanotopography is a parameter that measures the front-surface topology of an area and is defined as the deviation of a surface within a spatial wavelength of around 0.2 to 20 mm. Nanotopography differs from surface flatness in that, for nanotopography, the flatness of the wafer surface is measured relative to the wafer surface itself, while for surface flatness, the flatness of the wafer surface is measured relative to a flat chuck used to hold the wafer. Thus, a wafer may have perfect flatness, yet still have nanotopography. If a wafer has surface irregularities on the front and back sides of the wafer, but the front and back surfaces are parallel, the wafer has perfect flatness. However, the same wafer will exhibit nanotopography. Nanotopography bridges the gap between roughness and flatness in the topology map of wafer surface irregularities in spatial frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Conventional polishing compositions for silicon wafers exhibit high removal rates for silicon, but produce increased nanotopography of the silicon wafers. The increased nanotopography puts increased demands on the second, final polishing step to produce silicon wafers suitable for further processing into semiconductor substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In addition, the edges of the silicon wafers can come into contact with processing apparatus and transporting cases, which can result in cracking or chipping at the edge surfaces of the wafers. Fine particles can be generated by the cracking or chipping, which can interfere with further processing. Contamination of the silicon wafers with very fine particles can also occur at the coarsened surface of the edge, which particles can be released during processing and result in contamination of the wafer surfaces. Thus, the outermost periphery edge of the wafer is typically chamfered and then mirror polished at an early stage of the wafer processing. Further, in some processes, the silicon wafers are oxidized on one side to form a protective layer of silicon oxide, and so part of the wafer edge comprises silicon oxide. While silicon polishing compositions can be used for edge polishing, typically, a higher removal rate is needed for edge polishing of silicon wafers than for surface polishing. In addition, a suitable edge polishing composition desirably exhibits a useful removal rate on silicon oxide as well as on silicon. Thus, there remains a need in the art for improved polishing compositions for silicon wafers.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The invention provides a polishing composition comprising (a) silica, (b) a compound or compounds that increases the removal rate of silicon, (c) a tetraalkylammonium salt, and (d) water, wherein the polishing composition has a pH of about 7 to about 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The silica can be any suitable form of silica such as wet-process type silica, fumed silica, or combinations thereof. For example, the silica can comprise wet-process type silica particles (e.g., condensation-polymerized or precipitated silica particles). Condensation-polymerized silica particles typically are prepared by condensing Si(OH)<sub>4 </sub>to form colloidal particles, where colloidal particles are defined as having an average particle size between about 1 nm and about 1000 nm. Such abrasive particles can be prepared in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 5,230,833 or can be obtained as any of various commercially available products, such as the Akzo-Nobel Bindzil 50/80 product, the Nalco DVSTS006 product, and the Fuso PL-2 product, as well as other similar products available from DuPont, Bayer, Applied Research, Nissan Chemical, and Clariant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The silica can comprise fumed silica particles. Fumed silica particles can be produced from volatile precursors (e.g., silicon halides) in a pyrogenic process by hydrolysis and/or oxidation of the precursors in a high temperature flame (H<sub>2</sub>/air or H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>/air) to produce the fumed silica. The solution containing the precursor can be sprayed into a high temperature flame using a droplet generator, and the metal oxide can then be collected. Typical droplet generators include bi-fluid atomizers, high-pressure spray nozzles, and ultrasonic atomizers. Suitable fumed silica products are commercially available from producers such as Cabot, Tokuyama, and Degussa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The silica can have any suitable average particle size (i.e., average particle diameter). The silica can have an average particle size of about 4 nm or more, e.g., about 10 nm or more, about 15 nm or more, about 20 nm or more, or about 25 nm or more. Alternatively, or in addition, the silica can have an average particle size of about 180 nm or less, e.g., about 120 nm or less, about 110 nm or less, about 100 nm or less, about 90 nm or less, about 80 nm or less, about 70 nm or less, about 60 nm or less, 50 nm or less, or about 40 nm or less. Thus, the silica can have an average particle size bounded by any two of the above endpoints. For example, the silica can have an average particle size of about 10 nm to about 100 nm, about 20 nm to about 100 nm, about 20 nm to about 80 nm, about 20 nm to about 60 nm, or about 20 nm to about 40 nm. For a non-spherical silica particle, the size of the particle is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encompasses the particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The polishing composition can comprise any suitable amount of silica. Typically, the polishing composition can contain about 0.5 wt. % or more, e.g., about 1 wt. % or more, about 2 wt. % or more, or about 5 wt. % or more of silica. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can contain about 20 wt. % or less, e.g., about 15 wt. % or less, about 10 wt. % or less, about 8 wt. % or less, about 6 wt. % or less, or about 5 wt. % or less of silica. Thus, the polishing composition can comprise silica in an amount bounded by any two of the above endpoints recited for silica. For example the polishing composition can comprise about 0.5 wt. % to about 20 wt. %, about 1 wt. % to about 15 wt. %, about 5 wt. % to about 15 wt. %, or about 0.5 wt. % to about 5 wt. % of silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The silica particles preferably are colloidally stable. The term colloid refers to the suspension of silica particles in the liquid carrier. Colloidal stability refers to the maintenance of that suspension through time. In the context of this invention, an abrasive is considered colloidally stable if, when the abrasive is placed into a 100 ml graduated cylinder and allowed to stand unagitated for a time of 2 hours, the difference between the concentration of particles in the bottom 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([B] in terms of g/ml) and the concentration of particles in the top 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([T] in terms of g/ml) divided by the initial concentration of particles in the abrasive composition ([C] in terms of g/ml) is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., {[B]−[T]}/[C]≦0.5). More preferably, the value of [B]−[T]/[C] is less than or equal to 0.3, and most preferably is less than or equal to 0.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The polishing composition comprises water. The water is used to facilitate the application of the abrasive particles, compound(s) that increase the removal rate of silicon, and any other additives to the surface of a suitable substrate to be polished or planarized. Preferably, the water is deionized water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The polishing composition has a pH of about 11 or less (e.g., about 10 or less). Preferably, the polishing composition has a pH of about 7 or more (e.g., about 8 or more). Even more preferably, the polishing composition has a pH of about 7 to about 11 (e.g., about 8 to about 10). The polishing composition optionally contains pH adjusting agents, for example, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and/or nitric acid. The polishing composition also optionally comprises pH buffering systems. Many such pH buffering systems are well known in the art. The pH buffering agent can be any suitable buffering agent, for example, bicarbonate-carbonate buffer systems, aminoalkylsulfonic acids, and the like. The polishing composition can comprise any suitable amount of a pH adjustor and/or a pH buffering agent, provided that a suitable amount is used to achieve and/or maintain the pH of the polishing composition within a suitable range.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The polishing composition of the invention can be prepared by any suitable technique, many of which are known to those skilled in the art. The polishing composition can be prepared in a batch or continuous process. Generally, the polishing composition can be prepared by combining the components thereof in any order. The term “component” as used herein includes individual ingredients (e.g., silica, compound(s) that increases the removal rate of silicon, tetraalkylammonium salt, etc.) as well as any combination of ingredients (e.g., silica, compound(s) that increases the removal rate of silicon, tetraalkylammonium salt, buffers, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">For example, in one embodiment, the silica can be dispersed in water. The organic carboxylic acid, aminophosphonic acid, and tetraalkylammonium salt can then be added, and mixed by any method that is capable of incorporating the components into the polishing composition. Other compounds that increase the removal rate of silicon similarly can be utilized in the preparation of the polishing composition. The polishing composition can be prepared prior to use, with one or more components, such as a pH adjusting component, added to the polishing composition just before use (e.g., within about 7 days before use, or within about 1 hour before use, or within about 1 minute before use). The polishing composition also can be prepared by mixing the components at the surface of the substrate during the polishing operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The polishing composition also can be provided as a concentrate which is intended to be diluted with an appropriate amount of water prior to use. In such an embodiment, the polishing composition concentrate can comprise, for example, silica, a compound or compounds that increases the removal rate of silicon, a tetraalkylammonium salt, and water in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with an appropriate amount of water, each component of the polishing composition will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the appropriate range recited above for each component.

Furthermore, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the concentrate can contain an appropriate fraction of the water present in the final polishing composition in order to ensure that the compound or compounds that increases the removal rate of silicon, and other suitable additives are at least partially or fully dissolved in the concentrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The invention further provides a method of chemically-mechanically polishing a substrate comprising (i) contacting a substrate with a polishing pad and the polishing composition described herein, (ii) moving the polishing pad relative to the substrate with the polishing composition therebetween, and (iii) abrading at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Although the polishing composition of the invention can be used to polish any substrate, the polishing composition is particularly useful in the polishing of a substrate comprising silicon, for example, silicon wafers used in the electronics industry. In this regard, the silicon can be undoped silicon, or it can be doped silicon, such as p-type silicon doped with boron or aluminum. In addition, the silicon can be polysilicon. The inventive polishing composition and method of use thereof is suitable for the pre-polishing or the final polishing of silicon wafers as produced from silicon single crystals by diamond sawing and rough grinding, as well as for edge polishing of silicon wafers and for use in the reclamation of silicon wafers by polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Advantageously, the inventive polishing method exhibits improved nanotopography when used to polish silicon wafers after lapping and etching of diamond sawed silicon wafers. One way to measure change in nanotopography during chemical-mechanical polishing is to determine the value of the parameter: ΔR<sub>z</sub>/d wherein R<sub>z </sub>is the average maximum height of the profile, ΔR<sub>z </sub>is the change in R<sub>z </sub>from one time point to another time point, e.g., before and after chemical-mechanical polishing, and d is the amount of material removed in microns over that same time span, with the result expressed in nanometers. Referring to the FIGURE, R<sub>max </sub>represents the largest peak to valley height in a given sampling length L, and R<sub>z </sub>represents the average of 5 R<sub>max </sub>values in 5 contiguous sampling lengths. Sampling length L is approximately 5 mm. Suitable techniques for measuring R<sub>max </sub>(to enable the calculation of R<sub>z</sub>) include stylus profilometry, optical profilometry, and atomic force microscopy. Suitable instruments for stylus profilometry and optical profilometry are available from, e.g., Veeco Instruments (Plainview, N.Y.). Desirably, the inventive polishing method results in a ΔR<sub>z</sub>/d that is about zero or less, that is, substrate nanotopography is either unchanged or improved after use of the inventive polishing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The polishing method of the invention is particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus. Typically, the apparatus comprises a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving with the platen when in motion, and a carrier that holds a substrate to be polished by contacting and moving the substrate relative to the surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with the polishing pad and the polishing composition of the invention and then the polishing pad moving relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">A substrate can be polished with the chemical-mechanical polishing composition with any suitable polishing pad (e.g., polishing surface). Suitable polishing pads include, for example, woven and non-woven polishing pads. Moreover, suitable polishing pads can comprise any suitable polymer of varying density, hardness, thickness, compressibility, ability to rebound upon compression, and compression modulus. Suitable polymers include, for example, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylfluoride, nylon, fluorocarbon, polycarbonate, polyester, polyacrylate, polyether, polyethylene, polyimide, polyurethane, polystyrene, polypropylene, conformed products thereof, and mixtures thereof. Hard polyurethane polishing pads are particularly useful in conjunction with the inventive polishing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Desirably, the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus further comprises an in situ polishing endpoint detection system, many of which are known in the art. Techniques for inspecting and monitoring the polishing process by analyzing light or other radiation reflected from a surface of the substrate being polished are known in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,353, U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,651, U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,511, U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,046, U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,183, U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,642, U.S. Pat. No. 5,838,447, U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,633, U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,796, U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,927, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,643. Desirably, the inspection or monitoring of the progress of the polishing process with respect to a substrate being polished enables the determination of the polishing end-point, i.e., the determination of when to terminate the polishing process with respect to a particular substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In an embodiment, the inventive method provides a method for polishing an edge of a silicon wafer, wherein the edge consists essentially of silicon. In another embodiment, the inventive method provides a method for polishing an edge of a wafer, wherein the edge has a surface consisting essentially of silicon and silicon oxide. The edge polishing can be carried out using techniques that are well known in the art. For example, edge polishing can be performed using edge polishers supplied by SpeedFam Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Advantageously, the inventive polishing method exhibits improved chucking mark performance when used to polish the edges of silicon wafers, wherein the edges of the silicon wafers consist essentially of silicon or consist essentially of silicon and silicon oxide. In edge polishing, the silicon wafers are typically held in place using a vacuum chuck attached to the back side of the wafer. The vacuum often draws polishing compositions onto the back of the wafer during polishing, where it can dry. The dried residue is referred to as a chucking mark. If the residue resulting from drying of the polishing compositions is not easily removed, the wafers then require additional cleaning steps after polishing, thereby adding to the cost of manufacture. Desirably, the inventive method results in chucking marks which are dry white residues and easily removed during further processing of the wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Advantageously, the inventive method further provides improved removal rates when used to polish wafers edges consisting essentially of silicon, thereby improving production throughput of the wafers. In addition, when used to polish wafers consisting essentially of silicon and silicon oxide, the inventive method exhibits improved removal rates for silicon oxide relative to silicon, thereby resulting in even polishing of the wafer edges.</div>
