<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">Methods for polishing wafers used in electrical integrated circuits typically include a two step process of first, a primary polishing step, and second, a final polishing step. The primary polishing is a polishing process to remove surface defects as a result of, for example, deposition of metal onto the surface of a silicon substrate. The primary polishing process typically involves the use of a polishing composition in a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process in which the polishing composition oxidizes a film surface of the substrate or wafer and removes the resultant oxide layer with the aid of solid abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">However, the use of abrasives and/or oxidizing agents in the primary polishing solution is associated with various disadvantages such as creating scratches on the surface of the substrate, abrasives remaining attached to the substrate surface after polishing, and over polishing of the substrate. Typically, wafers have surface defects of approximately 10 to 50 Î¼m after primary polishing, which are too great for satisfactory performance. Therefore, a second, final polishing is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The final polishing finishes a surface of a substrate by reducing surface roughness. However, the final polishing process typically uses a different polishing composition than that for the primary polishing process. Further, the final polishing composition typically does not result in high removal rates of materials on the substrate because the final polishing composition typically is more gentle than the primary polishing composition. As a result, the final polishing composition typically requires a longer polishing time and longer rinse time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">There exists a need for a polishing composition that results in low surface defects of the substrate undergoing polishing and achieves high removal rates.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The polishing composition of the invention comprises a pyrrolidone polymer, i.e., any polymer comprising a pyrrolidone monomer. The pyrrolidone monomer can be any suitable pyrrolidone monomer or combination of pyrrolidone monomers. Particularly useful pyrrolidone polymers are polyvinylpyrrolidone and poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-2-dimethylamino-ethyl methacrylate).

The polishing composition can contain 0.01 wt. % or more, 0.1 wt. % or more, 0.2 wt. % or more, or 0.5 wt. % or more of the tetraalkylammonium salt. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can contain about 5 wt. % or less, 4 wt. % or less, 3 wt. % or less, or 2 wt. % or less of the tetraalkylammonium salt.

The polishing composition can contain 0.02 wt. % or more, 0.05 wt. % or more, about 0.1 wt. % or more, or 0.3 wt. % or more of the rate accelerator. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can contain about 5 wt. % or less, 4 wt. % or less, 3 wt. % or less, 2 wt. % or less, or 1 wt. % or less of the rate accelerator. Thus, the polishing composition can comprise an amount of rate accelerator in an amount bounded by any two of the above endpoints. For example, the rate accelerator can be present in the polishing composition in an amount of 0.02-5 wt. %, 0.05-3 wt. %, or 0.1-2 wt. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The polishing composition can further comprise one or more bicarbonate salts. The bicarbonate salt can be any suitable bicarbonate salt and can be, for example, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The polishing composition can contain any suitable amount of the bicarbonate salt. The polishing composition can contain 0.05 wt. % or more, 0.1 wt. % or more, 0.5 wt. % or more, or 1 wt. % or more of the bicarbonate salt. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can contain 5 wt. % or less, 4 wt. % or less, 3 wt. % or less, or 2 wt. % or less of the bicarbonate salt.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The polishing composition can comprise an oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent is a substance that oxidizes a metal and/or silicon dioxide-based layer of a substrate. The oxidizing agent can be any suitable oxidizing agent or combination of oxidizing agents. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is at least one of potassium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulfate, hydroxylamine, and ammonia iodate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Alternatively, the polishing composition can exclude an oxidizing agent; i.e., the invention provides a polishing composition that does not contain any oxidizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The polishing composition may comprise an abrasive. The abrasive can be any suitable abrasive or combination of abrasives, including, without limitation, metallic and solid elemental particles, polymer particles, oxides, fluorides, carbonates, borides, nitrides and hydroxides of aluminum, silica, zirconium, titanium, and mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The abrasive can comprise silica particles. The silica can be any suitable form of silica such as wet-process type silica, fumed silica, or combinations thereof. For example, the silica can comprise wet-process type silica particles (e.g., condensation-polymerized or precipitated silica particles). Condensation-polymerized silica particles typically are prepared by condensing Si(OH)<sub>4 </sub>to form colloidal particles, where colloidal particles are defined as having an average particle size between about 1 nm and about 1000 nm. Such abrasive particles can be prepared in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 5,230,833 or can be obtained as any of various commercially available products, such as the Akzo-Nobel Bindzil 50/80 product, the Nalco DVSTS006 product, and the Fuso PL-2 product, as well as other similar products available from DuPont, Bayer. Applied Research, Nissan Chemical, and Clariant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The silica can have any suitable average particle size (i.e., average particle diameter). The silica can have an average particle size of 4 nm or more, 10 nm or more, 15 nm or more, 20 nm or more, or 25 nm or more. Alternatively, or in addition, the silica can have an average particle size of 180 nm or less, 160 nm or less, 120 nm or less, 110 nm or less, 100 nm or less, 90) nm or less, 80 nm or less, 70 nm or less, 60 nm or less, 50 nm or less, or 40 nm or less.

For example, the silica can have an average particle size of 10-1001 nm, 20-160 nm, 20-80 nm, 20-60 nm, or 20-40 nm. For a non-spherical particle, the size of the particle is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encompasses the particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The abrasive particles preferably are colloidally stable. The term colloid refers to the suspension of abrasive particles in the liquid carrier. Colloidal stability refers to the maintenance of that suspension through time. In the context of this invention, an abrasive is considered colloidally stable if, when the abrasive is placed into a 100 ml graduated cylinder and allowed to stand unagitated for a time of 2 hours, the difference between the concentration of particles in the bottom 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([B] in terms of g/ml) and the concentration of particles in the top 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([T] in terms of g/ml) divided by the initial concentration of particles in the abrasive composition ([C] in terms of g/ml) is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., {[B]â[T]}/[C]â¦0.5). More preferably, the value of [B]â[T]/[C] is less than or equal to 0.3, and most preferably is less than or equal to 0.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The polishing composition can contain any suitable amount of abrasive. The polishing composition can contain 0.5 wt. % or more, 1 wt. % or more, 2 wt. % or more, or 5 wt. % or more of abrasive. Alternatively, or in addition, the polishing composition can contain 20 wt. % or less, 15 wt. % or less, 10 wt. % or less, 8 wt. % or less, or 6 wt. % or less of abrasive. Thus, the polishing composition can comprise abrasive in an amount bounded by any two of the above endpoints recited for the abrasive. For example, the polishing composition can comprise 0.5-6 wt. %, 1-20 wt. %, 2-10 wt. %, or 5-20 wt. % of abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Alternatively, the polishing composition can exclude an abrasive, i.e., the invention provides a polishing composition that does not contain any abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The polishing composition comprises water. The water is used to facilitate the application of the polishing composition on the substrate to be polished. Preferably, the water is deionized water. All of the amounts of the components (wt. %'s) recited herein are based on the total amount of the polishing composition, i.e., the water and all other components of the polishing composition unless otherwise indicated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The polishing composition can comprise one or more other additives. Such additives include a dispersing agent. The dispersing agent can be any suitable dispersing agent or combination of dispersing agents, such as, for example, homopolymers or random, block, or gradient acrylate copolymers comprising one or more acrylic monomers (e.g., polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, vinyl acrylates and styrene acrylates), combinations thereof, and salts thereof. Other suitable additives include biocides. The biocide can be any suitable biocide or combination of biocides, for example, an isothiazolinone biocide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The polishing composition of the invention can be prepared by any suitable technique, many of which are known to those skilled in the art. The polishing composition can be prepared in a batch or continuous process. Generally, the polishing composition can be prepared by combining the components thereof in any order. The term âcomponentâ as used herein includes individual ingredients (e.g., pyrrolidine polymer, rate accelerator, tetraalkylammonium salt, etc.) as well as any combination of ingredients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The polishing composition has a pH of about 11.7 or less (e.g., about 10 or less). Preferably, the polishing composition has a pH of about 7 or more (e.g., about 8 or more). Even more preferably, the polishing composition has a pH of about 7 to about 11.7 (e.g., about 8 to about 10).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The polishing composition can comprise a pH adjustor, a pH buffering agent, or combination thereof. The pH adjustor can be any suitable pH-adjusting compound or combination of pH-adjusting compounds. For example, the pH adjustor can be any suitable acid or base strong enough to produce the desired final pH. Examples of suitable acids include nitric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Examples of suitable bases include potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and tetraalkylammonium hydroxide. The pH buffering agent can be any suitable pH buffering agent or combination of pH buffering agents, for example, phosphates, acetates, borates, ammonium salts, and the like. Many such pH buffering systems are well known in the art. Examples of suitable pH buffering agents are bicarbonate-carbonate buffer systems, aminoalkylsulfonic acids, and the like. The polishing composition can comprise any suitable amount of a pH adjustor and/or a pH buffering agent, desirably an amount that achieves and/or maintains the pH of the polishing composition within a suitable range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The polishing composition also can be provided as a concentrate which is intended to be diluted with an appropriate amount of water prior to use. In such an embodiment, the polishing composition concentrate can comprise, for example, a pyrrolidone polymer, rate accelerator, aminophosphonic acid, tetraalkylammonium salt, and water in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with an appropriate amount of water and possibly oxidizing agent, each component of the polishing composition will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the appropriate range recited above for each component. Furthermore, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the concentrate can contain an appropriate fraction of the water present in the final polishing composition in order to ensure that the one or more of the other components are at least partially or fully dissolved in the concentrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The polishing composition can be supplied as a one-package system comprising a pyrrolidone polymer, rate accelerator, aminophosphonic acid, and tetraalkylammonium salt in an aqueous medium. Alternatively, for a polishing composition comprising an oxidizing agent, the pyrrolidone polymer, rate accelerator, aminophosphonic acid, and tetraalkylammonium salt may be supplied in a first container, and the oxidizing agent can be supplied in a second container by itself or as a solution in water. For example, potassium hydroxide is desirably supplied separately from the other components of the polishing composition and is combined, e.g., by the end-user, with the other components of the polishing composition shortly before use (e.g., 1 week or less prior to use, 1 day prior to use, 1 hour prior to use, 10 minutes prior to use, or 1 minute prior to use) or directly at the point-of-use. Other two-container or three or more container systems are within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">In order to mix components contained in storage devices to produce the polishing composition at or near the point-of-use, the storage devices typically are provided with one or more flow lines leading from each storage device to the point-of-use of the polishing composition (e.g., the platen, the polishing pad, or the substrate surface). As utilized herein, the term âpoint-of-useâ refers to the point at which the polishing composition is applied to the substrate surface (e.g., the polishing pad or the substrate surface itself). If the polishing composition is to be produced using point-of-use mixing, the components of the polishing composition are separately stored in two or more storage devices, as appropriate. By the term âflow lineâ is meant a path of flow from an individual storage container to the point-of-use of the component stored therein. The one or more flow lines can each lead directly to the point-of-use, or, in the situation that more than one flow line is used, two or more of the flow lines can be combined at any point into a single flow line that leads to the point-of-use. Furthermore, any of the one or more flow lines (e.g., the individual flow lines or a combined flow line) can first lead to one or more of the other devices (e.g., pumping device, measuring device, mixing device, etc.) prior to reaching the point-of-use of the component(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The components of the polishing composition can be delivered to the point-of-use independently (e.g., the components are delivered to the substrate surface whereupon the components are mixed during the polishing process), or one or more of the components can be combined before delivery to the point-of-use, e.g., shortly or immediately before delivery to the point-of-use. Components are combined âimmediately before delivery to the point-of-useâ if they are combined about 5 minutes or less prior to being added in mixed form to the point of use, e.g., onto a polishing pad or platen used in the polishing of a substrate, for example, about 4 minutes or less, about 3 minutes or less, about 2 minutes or less, about 1 minute or less, about 45 seconds or less, about 30 seconds or less, about 10 seconds or less, or even simultaneous to the delivery of the components at the point-of-use (e.g., the components are combined at a dispenser). Components also are combined âimmediately before delivery to the point-of-useâ if they are combined within 5 m of the point-of-use, such as within 1 m of the point-of-use or even within 10 cm of the point-of-use (e.g., within 1 cm of the point-of-use).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">When two or more of the components of the polishing composition are combined prior to reaching the point-of-use, the components can be combined in the flow line and delivered to the point-of-use without the use of a mixing device. Alternatively, one or more of the flow lines can lead into a mixing device to facilitate the combination of two or more of the components. Any suitable mixing device can be used. For example, the mixing device can be a nozzle or jet (e.g., a high pressure nozzle or jet) through which two or more of the components flow. Alternatively, the mixing device can be a container-type mixing device comprising one or more inlets by which two or more components of the polishing slurry are introduced to the mixer, and at least one outlet through which the mixed components exit the mixer to be delivered to the point-of-use, either directly or via other elements of the apparatus (e.g., via one or more flow lines). Furthermore, the mixing device can comprise more than one chamber, each chamber having at least one inlet and at least one outlet, wherein two or more components are combined in each chamber. If a container-type mixing device is used, the mixing device preferably comprises a mixing mechanism to further facilitate the combination of the components. Mixing mechanisms are generally known in the art and include stirrers, blenders, agitators, paddled baffles, gas sparger systems, vibrators, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The invention provides a method of polishing a substrate. The method comprises (i) contacting a substrate with a polishing pad and a polishing composition of the present invention, (ii) moving the polishing pad relative to the substrate with the polishing composition therebetween, and (iii) abrading at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Although the polishing composition of the invention can be used to polish any substrate, the polishing composition is particularly useful in the polishing of a substrate comprising silicon, for example, silicon wafers used in the electronic industry. The wafers of the semiconductor industry typically comprise or consist of, for example, a metal, metal oxide, metal nitride, metal composite, metal alloy, a low dielectric material, or combinations thereof. The inventive polishing composition and method of use thereof is suitable for the pre-polishing or the final polishing of the silicon wafers as produced from silicon single crystals by diamond sawing and rough grinding, as well as for edge polishing of silicon wafers and for use in the reclamation of silicon wafers by polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The polishing composition and method of the invention are particularly suited for polishing silicon wafers comprising a silicon dioxide-based dielectric layer, which can be derived from any suitable precursor. Preferably, the silicon dioxide-based dielectric layer is derived from silane precursors, more preferably from oxidized silane precursors, such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). The silicon dioxide-based dielectric layer can include but is not limited to borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), PETEOS, thermal oxide, undoped silicate glass, and HDP oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The polishing composition and methods of the invention are particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus. Typically, the apparatus comprises a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving with the platen when in motion, and a carrier that holds a substrate to be polished by contacting and moving the substrate relative to the surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with the polishing pad and the polishing composition of the invention, and then the polishing pad moving relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate to polish the substrate. In particular, in the course of polishing a substrate, material on the surface of the substrate, e.g., one or more of the aforementioned materials, is abraded, i.e., removed from the surface of the substrate, so as to polish the substrate and provide a smoother, more planar substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">A substrate can be polished with the polishing composition using any suitable polishing pad (e.g., polishing surface). Suitable polishing pads include, for example, woven and non-woven polishing pads. Moreover, suitable polishing pads can comprise any suitable polymer of varying density, hardness, thickness, compressibility, ability to rebound upon compression, and compression modulus. Suitable polymers include, for example, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylfluoride, nylon, fluorocarbon, polycarbonate, polyester, polyacrylate, polyether, polyethylene, polyamide, polyurethane, polystyrene, polypropylene, coformed products thereof, and mixtures thereof. Soft polyurethane polishing pads are particularly useful in conjunction with the inventive polishing method. Typical polishing pads include, but are not limited to, SURFINâ¢ 000, SURFINâ¢ SSW1, SPM3100 (commercially available from Eminess Technologies), POLITEXâ¢, and Fujibo POLYPASâ¢ 27 polishing pads. A particularly preferred polishing pad is the EPICâ¢ D100 polishing pad commercially available from Cabot Microelectronics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Desirably, the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus further comprises an in situ polishing endpoint detection system. Techniques for inspecting and monitoring the polishing process by analyzing light or other radiation reflected from a surface of the substrate being polished are known in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,353, U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,651, U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,511, U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,046, U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,183, U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,642, U.S. Pat. No. 5,838,447, U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,633, U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,796, U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,927, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,643. Desirably, the inspection or monitoring of the progress of the polishing process with respect to a substrate being polished enables the determination of the polishing end-point, i.e., the determination of when to terminate the polishing process with respect to a particular substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Advantageously, the polishing composition and method of the invention provide improved removal rates (i.e., abrasion of materials from the surface of substrates) when used to polish certain substrates, especially silicon wafers. In addition, the inventive polishing composition and method provide improved surface roughness (i.e., a more smooth or planar substrate surface) when used to polish certain substrates, especially silicon wafers.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The polyvinyl pyrrolidone used in the examples is PVPK90, available from BASF, which has a molecular weight of 1,200-2,000 kD as determined by gas phase chromatography. The aminotri(methylene) phosphonic acid (ATMP) used was Dequest 2000EG available from Dequest. The polishing was performed using a Suba 500 polishing pad on a substrate comprising a silicon surface. The surface roughness of the substrate was determined by power spectral density (PSD).</div>
<heading>Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Polishing compositions 1A, 1B, and 1C were prepared with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), aminotri(methylene)phosphonic acid (ATMP), tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), 1,2,4-triazole, lactic acid, potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and condensation-polymerized silica having an average particle size of 55 nm in the amounts indicated in Table 1 with the remainder water, with a pH of about 10.5-11. Polishing compositions 1A and 1B were prepared in accordance with the invention, whereas polishing composition 1C lacked a pyrrolidone polymer and, therefore, was not an inventive polishing composition but rather a comparative polishing composition. These polishing compositions then were used to polish a silicon substrate under similar polishing conditions. The removal rate (RR) and surface roughness as indicated by power spectral density (PSD) for each polishing composition were determined and are set forth in Table 1.</div>
