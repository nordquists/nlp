<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a polishing composition for a silicon wafer, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate using the polishing composition, and a method for polishing a silicon wafer with the polishing composition.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">A polishing composition including silica particles has been known as a polishing composition used to polish a silicon wafer that is used in the manufacture of a semiconductor substrate. In this type of polishing composition, there are problems such that the surface defects (LPD: light point defects) of a silicon wafer occur due to the agglomeration of the silica particles, and when the polishing composition is filtered to remove an agglomerate, the filter is clogged (see, e.g., Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2). Moreover, in order to improve the polishing rate, a polishing composition that includes a water-soluble macromolecular compound including a nitrogen-containing group has been known (see Patent Document 3).</div>

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Patent Document 1 is intended to prevent clogging of a filter and proposes a polishing composition including colloidal silica, potassium hydroxide, and potassium bicarbonate. However, since the polishing composition includes a sodium ion and a potassium ion, abrasive grains are likely to adhere to the surface of a silicon wafer. As a result of this, the surface defects of the silicon wafer may occur easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Patent Document 2 is intended to reduce the LPD and proposes a polishing composition including at least one type of water-soluble polymer selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone and poly(N-vinylformamide), and an alkali. However, polishing with this polishing composition cannot achieve a satisfactory polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Patent Document 3 proposes a polishing composition including a water-soluble macromolecular compound including a nitrogen-containing group such as polyethyleneimine. However, when this polishing composition is used, silica particles are agglomerated by the water-soluble macromolecular compound including the nitrogen-containing group, resulting in the degradation of the surface state of a silicon wafer (e.g., the generation of scratches).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Patent Document 4 is intended to improve the polishing rate and the wettability of the surface of an object to be polished and proposes a polishing composition including hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). However, the use of the HEC tends to form an agglomerate of silica particles, and even if the polishing composition is filtered, the filter is clogged at once. Therefore, the polishing composition cannot be filtered immediately before polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Moreover, the polishing composition is generally stored and transported in the form of a concentrated liquid. Thus, the storage stability of the concentrated liquid of the polishing composition is also required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The present invention provides a polishing composition for a silicon wafer that not only can achieve high-speed polishing of a silicon wafer and ensure good storage stability of the concentrated liquid and good wettability of the surface of the silicon wafer, but also can reduce clogging of a filter, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor substrate using the polishing composition, and a method for polishing a silicon wafer with the polishing composition.</div>
<heading>Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">A polishing composition for a silicon wafer of the present invention includes a macromolecular compound, an abrasive, and an aqueous medium. The macromolecular compound includes a constitutional unit (a1) represented by the following general formula (1), a constitutional unit (a2) represented by the following general formula (2), and a constitutional unit (a3) represented by the following general formula (3). The total of the constitutional unit (a3) is 0.001 to 1.5 mol % of the constitutional units of the macromolecular compound.</div>

Then, the weight difference was divided by the density; area, and polishing time of each silicon wafer, so that the polishing rate per unit time for one side of the silicon wafer was determined. In Tables 2 and 3, the polishing rate is shown as a relative value calculated by assuming that the polishing rate for one side of the silicon wafer in the case of using the polishing composition in Comparative Example 4 was “1.00”.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">As a pretreatment, a silicon wafer cut into 40×40 mm square was immersed in a 1% diluted hydrofluoric acid aqueous solution for 2 minutes to remove the oxide film, and subsequently the silicon wafer was immersed in ion-exchanged water for an instant, rinsed, and dried by air blow. Next, the silicon wafer was immersed in each of the polishing compositions for 20 seconds, and then raised and allowed to stand still in the air for 15 seconds. After the liquid pool in the lower portion of the silicon wafer was removed with a Kimwipe, the area of a hydrophilic portion on the mirror surface of the silicon wafer was visually judged.

Next, the silicon wafer was placed in a plastic container, and then 20 g of the polishing composition was added to the plastic container and covered with a lid. After the silicon wafer was immersed in the polishing composition at 80° C. for 5 hours, the silicon wafer was immersed in ion-exchanged water for an instant, rinsed, and dried by air blow.

In contrast, the polishing compositions of Comparative Examples 1 to 2 had poor wettability, and the polishing compositions of Comparative Examples 2 to 3 had low storage stability of the concentrated liquid. Moreover, when the polishing compositions of Comparative Examples 2 to 3 were supplied to the polishing pad, there were agglomerates large enough to be visually identified. It was clear that such agglomerates would be the cause of scratches. In the polishing composition of Comparative Example 4, the amount of liquid passing through the filter was small.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The use of the polishing composition of the present invention can achieve high-speed polishing of a silicon wafer, and also can reduce clogging of a filter. Therefore, the polishing composition of the present invention is useful as a polishing composition that is to be used in the process of manufacturing various semiconductor substrates, and particularly useful as a polishing composition for final polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
