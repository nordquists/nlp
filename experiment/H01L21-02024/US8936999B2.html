<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In recent years, an integrated circuit using an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate in which a thin single crystal semiconductor layer exists on an insulating surface, instead of a bulk silicon wafer has been developed. The use of an SOI substrate leads to a reduction in the parasitic capacitance between a drain of a transistor and the substrate; thus, SOI substrates have attracted attention for their ability to improve performance of semiconductor integrated circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">One of known methods for manufacturing an SOI substrate is a hydrogen ion implantation separation method (for example, see Patent Document 1). A method for manufacturing an SOI substrate according to a hydrogen ion implantation separation method is summarized below. First, hydrogen ions are implanted into one silicon wafer by an ion implantation method to form a microbubble layer in the region at a certain depth from a top surface of the silicon wafer. Next, the silicon wafer is bonded to the other silicon wafer with a silicon oxide film provided therebetween. Then, heat treatment is performed thereon, so that a part of the one silicon wafer is separated in a thin film shape along the microbubble layer serving as a cleavage plane. Accordingly, a single crystal silicon film can be formed over the other silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Further, a method for forming a single crystal silicon layer over a base substrate made of glass according to such a hydrogen ion implantation separation method has been proposed (for example, see Patent Document 2). Glass substrates are more suitable for an increase in area and are less expensive than silicon wafers; thus, an SOI substrate which has a large area and is inexpensive can be manufactured by using the glass substrate as a base substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Further, in Patent Document 2, it is proposed that a silicon nitride film is provided between a base substrate and a single crystal silicon layer so as to prevent impurities in the base substrate or the like from diffusing into the single crystal silicon layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">A single crystal semiconductor substrate is irradiated with accelerated hydrogen ions, whereby the hydrogen ions are implanted or doped into the single crystal semiconductor substrate at a certain depth from a top surface thereof, so that an embrittled region is formed. Then, heat treatment is performed thereon, whereby hydrogen contained in the embrittled region is vaporized and expanded, so that a cleavage plane is formed in the embrittled region.</div>

<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, according to the above-described hydrogen ion implantation separation method, the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer is uneven in some cases despite the same condition of hydrogen ion implantation and separation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Unevenness in the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer may adversely affects the subsequent manufacturing process or the reliability of a semiconductor element formed using the single crystal semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In view of the forgoing, one object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide an SOI substrate including a semiconductor layer whose thickness is even.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">According to one embodiment of the present invention, before irradiating a semiconductor substrate with ions, a rear surface of the semiconductor substrate which is opposite to a surface of the same irradiated with the ions is polished to be planarized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Irradiation of a semiconductor substrate with ions generates heat to increase the temperature of the semiconductor substrate. However, part of the generated heat is released through a rear surface of the semiconductor substrate which is opposite to a surface of the same irradiated with the ions. Therefore, if the rear surface is uneven, heat is also released unevenly depending on the unevenness of the rear surface, leading to unevenness of the temperature distribution entirely over the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Further, by the irradiation of the semiconductor substrate with ions, ions are accumulated in the semiconductor substrate at a certain depth, so that an embrittled region is formed. The ions of the irradiation are dispersed in accordance with the temperature distribution in the semiconductor substrate; thus, if the temperature distribution entirely over the semiconductor substrate is uneven, the ions are also dispersed unevenly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The thickness of a semiconductor layer which is separated from such a semiconductor substrate with ions dispersed unevenly may be uneven.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In this specification, the “surface is uneven” means the surface is not flat and has a small step, roughness, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a rear surface of a semiconductor substrate which is opposite to a surface of the same which is irradiated with ions is polished to be planarized. Heat generated by irradiation of the semiconductor substrate with ions as described above can be released evenly through the rear surface because the rear surface is planarized. Accordingly, the ions are dispersed evenly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">According to the one embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor layer can be separated from the semiconductor substrate whose rear surface is polished, so that the thickness of the semiconductor layer is even.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">One embodiment of the present invention is a method for manufacturing an SOI substrate, by which a semiconductor layer is formed over a base substrate.

The value of 3σ (σ denotes a standard deviation of thickness of the semiconductor layer) is less than or equal to 1.5 nm.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Embodiments of the present invention disclosed in this specification are hereinafter described using the accompanying drawings. The present invention disclosed in this specification can be carried out in a variety of different modes, and it is easily understood for those skilled in the art that the modes and details of the present invention disclosed in this specification can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not construed as being limited to description of the embodiments. The same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in the drawings, and repeated description thereof is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In this specification and the like, the semiconductor device refers to any element or any device which functions by utilizing a semiconductor, and includes in its category any electric device such as an electronic circuit, a display device, a light emitting device, and the like and any electronic appliance equipped with such an electric device.</div>
<heading>Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">First, a semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is prepared as a bond substrate. As the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate or a single crystal semiconductor substrate can be used. As the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, for example, a semiconductor substrate that is formed of an element which belongs to Group <b>14</b>, such as a polycrystalline or single crystal silicon substrate, a polycrystalline or single crystal germanium substrate, a polycrystalline or single crystal silicon germanium substrate, or a polycrystalline or single crystal silicon carbide substrate or a polycrystalline, or a compound semiconductor substrate using gallium arsenide, indium phosphate, or the like can be used. The size of the silicon substrate is typically 5 inches (125 mm) in diameter, 6 inches (150 mm) in diameter, 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter, and 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter, and a typical shape thereof is a circular shape. The shape of the silicon substrate is not necessarily a circular shape, and may be a rectangular shape. The case where a single crystal silicon substrate (a silicon wafer) having a rectangular shape is used as the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is described hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Further, a base substrate <b>100</b> is prepared. As the base substrate <b>100</b>, a light-transmitting glass substrate used for a liquid crystal display device or the like can be used. As the glass substrate, the one whose strain point is 600° C. or more is preferably used. Further, it is preferable that the glass substrate be a non-alkali glass substrate. As a material of the non-alkali glass substrate, a glass material such as aluminosilicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, or barium borosilicate glass is used, for example. The use of such a glass substrate as the base substrate <b>100</b>, which is inexpensive and can be formed to have a large area, leads to lower cost than the case where a silicon substrate is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">As the base substrate <b>100</b>, a substrate formed of an insulator, such as a ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate, or a sapphire substrate, a semiconductor substrate formed of silicon, a substrate formed of a conductor such as metal or stainless steel, or the like can also be used. Further, a plastic substrate having a heat resistance high enough to withstand a process temperature in the manufacturing process may also be used as the base substrate <b>100</b>. The case where a glass substrate having a rectangular shape is used as the base substrate <b>100</b> is described hereinafter. Unless otherwise specified, a square is also regarded as the rectangular shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">An insulating layer <b>101</b> is formed over the base substrate <b>100</b>. There is no particular limitation on the method for forming the insulating layer <b>101</b>; a sputtering method, a plasma CVD method, or the like can be employed, for example. Since the insulating layer <b>101</b> has a surface to be attached, the insulating layer <b>101</b> is preferably formed such that the surface has high planarity. The insulating layer <b>101</b> can be formed using one or more materials selected from silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxynitride, aluminum nitride oxide, and the like. For example, when silicon oxide is used for the insulating layer <b>101</b>, formation using an organosilane gas by a chemical vapor deposition method enables the insulating layer <b>101</b> to have excellent planarity. Although the insulating layer <b>101</b> has a single-layer structure in this embodiment, it may have a stacked-layer structure. The insulating layer <b>101</b> is not necessarily provided as long as a problem does not particularly occur in attachment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Then, a rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> which is opposite to a surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> which is irradiated with hydrogen ions later is polished (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). As the method for polishing, mechanical polishing, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), or both of them can be employed. The chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is used in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">A process of the chemical mechanical polishing in this embodiment is described below. First polishing is performed on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, first. In the first polishing, ILD3013 manufactured by Nitta Haas Incorporated was used as polish (slurry) and T15 manufactured by Toray Industries, Inc. was used as a polishing pad. The polishing pressure was 0.02 MPa and the polishing time was 900 seconds in the first polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Next, finishing polishing (second polishing) was performed thereon. In the finishing polishing, NP8020 manufactured by Nitta Haas Incorporated was used as polish (slurry) and Supreme manufactured by Nitta Haas Incorporated was used as a polishing pad. The polishing pressure was 0.02 MPa and the polishing time was 600 seconds in the finishing polishing. By the first polishing and finishing polishing, the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is polished by about 5 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">After the polishing, first cleaning for removing polished particles physically with a brush, second cleaning for cleaning plural times with ozone water and hydrofluoric acid, a jet cleaning with pure water and nitrogen, and third cleaning including pure water, ultrasonic cleaning were performed in this order thereon. Drying in a nitrogen atmosphere is performed thereon after the third cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows surface roughness of the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> after being polished by 5 μm (polished by a thickness of 5 μm from a top surface of the rear surface). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows surface roughness of the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> after being polished by 10 μm (polished by a thickness of 10 μm from the top surface of the rear surface). The semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> are referred to as Sample A and Sample B, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">For comparison, surface roughness of a rear surface of a semiconductor substrate which has not been polished is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows surface roughness of a silicon wafer (a p-type silicon wafer with a plane direction (<b>100</b>) and a sheet resistance of greater than or equal to 15 Ωcm and less than or equal to 25 Ωcm) which has not been polished. The silicon wafer shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is referred to as Sample C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The surface roughness shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b> was measured by a microfigure measuring instrument (Model ET4100 manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory Ltd.) which is a step measuring instrument. In the microfigure measuring instrument, a needle is set in contact with the sample and moved, whereby a step of the sample is measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b>, a “distance” in the horizontal axis (x-axis) indicates a distance from one point in the direction parallel to the top surface of the semiconductor substrate (silicon wafer), and a “height” in the vertical axis (y-axis) indicates a height (or a depth) from the one point in the direction perpendicular to a top surface of the semiconductor substrate (silicon wafer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a variation in height of about 3.5 μm exists in the rear surface of the silicon wafer which has not been polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, few variations in height exist in the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> after being polished. Further, the degree of variation in height is equivalent between <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, revealing that a surface sufficiently flat can be provided by polishing the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> by 5 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> which is irradiated with ions may also be polished to remove impurities attaching to the surface. The same manner as the polishing of the rear surface may be applied to the polishing of the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Next, an insulating layer <b>114</b> is provided for the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">As the insulating layer <b>114</b>, a single layer of a silicon oxide layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, a silicon nitride layer, a silicon nitride oxide layer, or the like or a stacked-layer of these layers can be used. The insulating layer <b>114</b> can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. In the case where the insulating layer <b>114</b> is formed by a CVD method, a silicon oxide layer formed using organosilane such as tetraethylorthosilicate (abbreviation: TEOS, chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) is preferably used as the insulating layer <b>114</b> in terms of productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The silicon oxynitride layer refers to a layer that contains more oxygen than nitrogen and contains oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 50 at. % to 70 at. %, 0.5 at. % to 15 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 0.1 at. % to 10 at. %, respectively according to the measurement by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering (HFS). Further, the silicon nitride oxide layer refers to a layer that contains more nitrogen than oxygen, and contains oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 5 at. % to 30 at. %, 20 at. % to 50 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 15 at. % to 25 at. %, respectively according to the measurement by RBS and HFS. The respective content percentage of oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen are within the above-described ranges where the total number of atoms which constitute silicon oxynitride or silicon nitride oxide is 100 at. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The insulating layer <b>114</b> may also be formed by performing thermal oxidation treatment on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. In that case, the thermal oxidation treatment is preferably performed in an oxidation atmosphere with halogen added. As an example of such thermal oxidation treatment, it is preferable that thermal oxidation treatment be performed in an atmosphere containing hydrogen chloride (HCl) at 0.5 volume % to 10 volume % (preferably, 3 volume %) with respect to oxygen at a temperature of 900° C. to 1150° C. (for example, 950° C.). Processing time thereof may be set to 0.1 to 6 hours, preferably 0.5 to 1 hour. The thickness of an oxide film to be formed is set to 10 nm to 1000 nm (preferably, 50 nm to 200 nm), for example, 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In this embodiment, thermal oxidation treatment in an atmosphere containing hydrogen chloride (HCl) is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, so that the insulating layer <b>114</b> (here, a silicon oxide layer) is formed; thus, the insulating layer <b>114</b> contains a chlorine atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Although the insulating layer <b>114</b> is formed entirely on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> in this embodiment, the insulating layer <b>114</b> may be provided only for the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> to which the base substrate <b>100</b> is attached (i.e., the surface which is irradiated with ions <b>103</b> later). The insulating layer <b>114</b> is not necessarily provided as long as a problem does not particularly occur in attachment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Next, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> with the insulating layer <b>114</b> is irradiated with the ions <b>103</b>. The ions <b>103</b> irradiate the surface which is opposite to the rear surface which is polished as described above. In this manner, an embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). For example, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is irradiated with an ion beam which consists of the ions <b>103</b> accelerated, so that the embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> at a certain depth from the top surface thereof. The depth where the embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed is controlled by the accelerating energy of the ion beam and the incidence angle thereof. In other words, the embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed in a region at a depth the same or substantially the same as the average penetration depth of the ions <b>103</b>. Here, the depth at which the embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed is preferably uniform entirely over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The thickness of a semiconductor layer separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is determined by the depth at which the embrittled region <b>112</b> is formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">An ion implantation apparatus or an ion doping apparatus can be used to add the ions <b>103</b> to the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. In the ion implantation apparatus, a source gas is excited to generate ion species, the ion species are mass-separated, and an object is irradiated with the ion specie(s) having a certain mass/certain masses. In the ion doping apparatus, a process gas is excited to generate ion species, the ion species are not mass-separated, and an object is irradiated with the ion species; however, in an ion doping apparatus equipped with a mass separator, irradiation with the ions <b>103</b> can be performed involving mass separation as in the ion implantation apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In the case of using an ion doping apparatus, the process for forming the embrittled region <b>112</b> can be performed, for example, under the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The accelerating voltage is greater than or equal to 10 kV and less than or equal to 100 kV (preferably greater than or equal to 30 kV and less than or equal to 80 kV).</div>

In the case of using such a gas containing hydrogen as the source gas, it is preferable to perform irradiation with a large amount of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>. Specifically, it is preferable to use an ion beam in which H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> is contained at 70% or more of the total of H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>. It is further preferable that the proportion of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions be 80% or more. Such a high proportion of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> enables the embrittled region <b>112</b> to contain hydrogen at a concentration of greater than or equal to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, which facilitates separation in the embrittled region <b>112</b>. Furthermore, with the irradiation with a large number of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions, formation of the embrittled region <b>112</b> takes shorter than the case of irradiation with H<sup>+</sup> ions and H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions. Further, the use of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> ions leads to a reduction in the average penetration depth of the ions <b>103</b>; thus, the embrittled region <b>112</b> can be formed in a shallow region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In the case of using the ion implantation apparatus, it is preferable to perform irradiation with H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> through mass separation. Of course, irradiation with H<sup>+</sup> or H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup> may also be performed in that case. Note that, since ion species are selected for irradiation in the case of using the ion implantation apparatus, the ion irradiation efficiency is decreased compared to the case of using the ion doping apparatus, in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">As the source gas for the ion irradiation, as well as a gas containing hydrogen, one or more kinds of gases selected from a rare gas such as helium or argon; a halogen gas typified by a fluorine gas or a chlorine gas; or a halogen compound gas such as a fluorine compound gas (e.g., BF<sub>3</sub>) can be used. When helium is used as the source gas, an ion beam with high proportion of He<sup>+ </sup>ions can be formed without mass separation, by which the embrittled region <b>112</b> can be formed efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Further, the embrittled region <b>112</b> can also be formed by performing irradiation with the ions <b>103</b> plural times. In that case, the ion irradiation may be performed with different source gases or the same source gas. For example, ion irradiation can be performed using a rare gas as a source gas, and then, ion irradiation can be performed using a gas containing hydrogen as a source gas. Further or alternatively, ion irradiation can performed first using a halogen gas or a halogen compound gas, and then, ion irradiation can be performed using a gas containing hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The irradiation of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> with the ions <b>103</b> generates heat to increase the temperature of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In this embodiment of the present invention, the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> which is opposite to the surface of the same which is irradiated with the ions <b>103</b> is polished to be planarized. Therefore, heat generated by the irradiation of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> with the ions <b>103</b> is released evenly through the rear surface. Accordingly, the temperature distribution entirely over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> also becomes even, and the ions <b>103</b> are dispersed evenly in the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Accordingly, a semiconductor layer whose thickness is even can be separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> as described later in the manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Next, at least one of the insulating layer <b>114</b> formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> and the base substrate <b>100</b> is preferably subjected to surface treatment. The surface treatment can improve the bonding strength at the bonding interface between the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> and the base substrate <b>100</b>. The surface treatment can also reduce particles (also referred to as dust) or the like on the substrate, leading to a reduction in bonding defects due to particles or the like. Note that the surface treatment can also be performed on the insulating layer <b>101</b> formed over the base substrate <b>100</b>, if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">As examples of the surface treatment, a wet treatment, a dry treatment, and a combination of both are given. A combination of different wet treatments or a combination of different dry treatments may also be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">As examples of the wet treatment, ozone treatment using ozone water (ozone water cleaning), megasonic cleaning, two-fluid cleaning (a method in which functional water such as pure water or hydrogenated water and a carrier gas such as nitrogen are sprayed together), and the like can be given. As examples of the dry treatment, ultraviolet treatment, ozone treatment, plasma treatment, plasma treatment with bias application, radical treatment, and the like can be given. The surface treatment as described above has the effect of improving hydrophilicity and cleanliness of a top surface of the object to be subjected (i.e., the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the insulating layer <b>114</b> formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the base substrate <b>100</b>). Consequently, the bonding strength between the substrates can be improved. In addition, since the surface treatment can reduce particles or the like on the substrate, generation of bonding defects due to particles or the like can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The wet treatment is effective for the removal of macro dust and the like attaching to the top surface of the object. The dry treatment is effective for the removal or decomposition of micro dust such as an organic substance attaching to the top surface of the object. Therefore, it is preferable to perform the dry treatment such as ultraviolet treatment and the wet treatment such as cleaning sequentially on the object because the top surface of the object can be made clean and hydrophilic and generation of watermarks on the top surface of the object can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">After the wet treatment, the object is preferably dried. As the drying method, a method of spraying a gas with an air knife, drying with IPA (a method in which water is replaced with the vapor of isopropyl alcohol), drying with spinning, or the like can be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">As an example of the dry treatment, plasma treatment is described below. Here, the plasma treatment is performed in a plasma state which is produced by introducing an inert gas (such as an argon gas) into a chamber in a vacuum state and applying a bias voltage to the top surface of the object (e.g., the base substrate <b>100</b>). In the plasma, an electron and a cation of Ar are present, and the cation of Ar is accelerated in the cathode direction (towards the base substrate <b>100</b> side). The accelerated Ar cation collides against the top surface of the the base substrate <b>100</b>, whereby the top surface of the base substrate <b>100</b> is etched by sputtering. A projection of the top surface of the base substrate <b>100</b> is preferentially etched by sputtering; thus, the planarity of the top surface of the base substrate <b>100</b> can be improved. Further, by the accelerated Ar cation, impurities such as an organic substance on the base substrate <b>100</b> can be removed, so that the base substrate <b>100</b> can be activated. Alternatively, plasma treatment can also be performed in a plasma state produced by introducing a reactive gas (such as an O<sub>2 </sub>gas or an N<sub>2 </sub>gas) in addition to the inert gas into a chamber in a vacuum state and applying a bias voltage to the top surface of the object. By the reactive gas, defects caused by etching of the top surface of the base substrate <b>100</b> by sputtering can be repaired. The plasma treatment causes generation of a dangling bond on the top surface of the object, so that the top surface is activated to be suitable for bonding. Further, ions accelerated by the plasma treatment are implanted into a surface layer of the object, whereby a defect such as distortion is formed in the surface layer; accordingly, moisture dispersion at the attachment interface is facilitated, so that absorption of moisture can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">As another example of the dry treatment, surface treatment using oxygen in an active state in combination with ultraviolet light is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Ozone or oxygen in an active state such as singlet oxygen can effectively remove or decompose organic substances attaching to the top surface of the object. Further, the treatment using ozone or oxygen in an active state such as singlet oxygen may be combined with treatment using ultraviolet light having wavelengths less than 200 nm, so that the organic substances attaching to the top surface of the object can be removed more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">For example, irradiation with ultraviolet light may be performed under an atmosphere containing oxygen to perform the surface treatment of the object. Under the atmosphere containing oxygen, irradiation with ultraviolet light having wavelengths less than 200 nm and ultraviolet light having wavelengths greater than or equal to 200 nm can generate ozone and singlet oxygen, and irradiation with ultraviolet light having wavelengths less than 180 nm can also generate ozone and singlet oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">An example of a reaction which is caused by the irradiation with ultraviolet light having wavelengths of less than 200 nm and ultraviolet light having wavelengths of greater than or equal to 200 nm under the atmosphere containing oxygen is described below:

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">In the reaction formula (1), irradiation with light (hν) having a wavelength (λ<sub>1 </sub>nm) of less than 200 nm in an atmosphere containing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) generates an oxygen atom (O(<sup>3</sup>P)) in a ground state. Next, in the reaction formula (2), the oxygen atom (O(<sup>3</sup>P)) in the ground state reacts with the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), whereby ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is generated. Then, in the reaction formula (3), irradiation with light having a wavelength (λ<sub>2 </sub>nm) of greater than or equal to 200 nm in the atmosphere containing the ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) generates singlet oxygen O(<sup>1</sup>D) in an excited state.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In the reaction formula (4), irradiation with ultraviolet light having a wavelength (λ<sub>3 </sub>nm) of less than 180 nm is performed in an atmosphere containing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to generate singlet oxygen O(<sup>1</sup>D) in an excited state and an oxygen atom (O(<sup>3</sup>P)) in a ground state.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">As described above, with the ultraviolet light having a wavelength less than 200 nm, a chemical bond in an organic substance and the like attaching to the top surface of the object can be cut, and with ozone or singlet oxygen, an organic substance attaching to the top surface of the object, the organic substance whose chemical bond is cut, or the like can be removed by oxidative decomposition.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">In this embodiment, as the surface treatment, the dry treatment and the wet treatment are performed on the base substrate <b>100</b> and the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> which is irradiated with the ions <b>103</b>. First, as the dry treatment, irradiation using a Xe excimer UV lamp is performed in an atmosphere containing oxygen. Next, as the wet treatment, cleaning with an alkaline cleaner, brush cleaning, or two-fluid cleaning (a method in which pure water and air are sprayed together) is performed. After that, by a method of spraying a gas with an air knife or drying with IPA, the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> are dried.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Next, the base substrate <b>100</b> is attached to the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">In the attachment of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> may be heated, whereby generation of defects caused by the attachment interface between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> can be suppressed. In the case where the base substrate <b>100</b> is heated, the heating temperature of the base substrate <b>100</b> is set to higher than or equal to 50° C. and lower than or equal to 100° C., preferably higher than or equal to 55° C. and lower than or equal to 95° C. There is no particular limitation on the heating time, which is set as appropriate so that the base substrate <b>100</b> reaches an appropriate temperature; for example, the base substrate <b>100</b> can be heated for 180 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Next, the base substrate <b>100</b> heated to the appropriate temperature is pressed to make an end portion of the base substrate <b>100</b> in contact with an end portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. With the use of a pin or the like, a point of the base substrate <b>100</b> or the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, for example, a central portion of the base substrate <b>100</b> can be pressed, whereby the base substrate <b>100</b> may be in contact with the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. The attachment of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> proceeds concentrically from the portion where they are in contact with each other. For example, when the attachment starts from respective ones of the corner portions of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the attachment proceeds concentrically toward respective opposite corners of the respective ones, to their entire top surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">A hydrogen bond or van der Waals forces act(s) on the attachment of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">On the other hand, too much moisture on the base substrate <b>100</b> or the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> increases the speed of the attachment, resulting in that a gas or particles are confined at the attachment interface.

In this specification and the like, a minute airspace exists between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, which is caused by such a gas or particles confined, is referred to as a void. The outer edge portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> means a region within about 5 mm from the edge of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Further, too much moisture on the base substrate <b>100</b> or the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> leads to remaining of unnecessary moisture for the attachment (hereinafter referred to as surplus moisture) at the attachment interface between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. The surplus moisture remaining at the attachment interface is heated and evaporated in a later heat treatment, laser light irradiation, or the like, which forms a void in a portion where the surplus moisture remains or the void is burst, appearing as an attachment defect. The attachment defect caused by such surplus moisture appears entirely over the substrate and is a big element of attachment defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Therefore, with heating on at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, surplus moisture can be reduced while a necessary amount of moisture for the attachment remains on the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. In this manner, confinement of a gas or particles at the attachment interface can be suppressed. Consequently, generation of voids at the attachment interface (particularly, within about 5 mm away from the edge of the substrate) can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">In addition to the above effects, with the heating on at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, remaining of the surplus moisture at the attachment interface can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Further, when plasma treatment is performed as the surface treatment, accelerated ions are introduced into the surface layer(s) of the base substrate <b>100</b> and/or the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, whereby a defect such as distortion is formed in the surface layer(s). Accordingly, diffusion of surplus moisture at the attachment interface is facilitated, so that the surplus moisture can be absorbed in the defect such as distortion of the surface layer(s). Therefore, remaining of the surplus moisture at the attachment interface can be suppressed. Accordingly, defects due to surplus moisture which appear in the subsequent process can be suppressed. Note that the surface layers of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> are respective top surfaces of the insulating layer <b>114</b> formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> and the base substrate <b>100</b>, or respective top surfaces of the insulating layer <b>114</b> formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> and the insulating layer <b>101</b> formed over the base substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">Further, before the base substrate <b>100</b> is in contact with the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the base substrate <b>100</b> may be cooled to an appropriate temperature after being heated. Remaining of surplus moisture at the attachment interface can also be suppressed since the amount of moisture on the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> can be controlled even when cooling is performed on at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> after being heated. Accordingly, defects due to surplus moisture which appear in the subsequent process can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Then, after the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is attached to the base substrate <b>100</b>, it is preferable to perform heat treatment on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> and the base substrate <b>100</b> to strengthen the attachment. The temperature of the heat treatment is needed to be a temperature at which separation in the embrittled region <b>112</b> does not start; for example, the temperature is set to lower than 400° C., preferably lower than or equal to 300° C. The heat treatment time is not particularly limited and can be set as appropriate depending on the relation between processing time and attachment strength. The heat treatment can be performed with a heating furnace such as a diffusion furnace or a resistance heating furnace, a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus, or the like. Further, only the attachment region can be locally heated by irradiation with microwaves or the like. The heat treatment may be skipped when the attachment strength is sufficiently high. In this embodiment, heat treatment is performed at 200° C. for two hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Next, heat treatment is performed thereon, so that the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is separated into a semiconductor layer <b>116</b> and a semiconductor substrate <b>120</b> along the embrittled region <b>112</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Through the above, an SOI substrate <b>180</b> in which the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is provided over the base substrate <b>100</b> with the insulating layer <b>114</b> and the insulating layer <b>101</b> provided therebetween can be obtained. Note that in the case where the insulating layer <b>101</b> is not formed over the base substrate <b>100</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is provided over the base substrate <b>100</b> with the insulating layer <b>114</b> provided therebetween in the SOI substrate <b>180</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">With the heat treatment, atoms added in the ion doping are deposited in microvoids in the embrittled region <b>112</b> by an increase in temperature, and thus the internal pressure of the microvoids is increased. The increase in pressure changes the volume in the microvoids in the embrittled region <b>112</b>, leading to separation of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> in the embrittled region <b>112</b>. Since the insulating layer <b>114</b> is bonded to the base substrate <b>100</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> which is separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is provided over the base substrate <b>100</b> with the insulating layer <b>114</b> provided therebetween. The temperature of the heat treatment is set to a temperature below the strain point of the base substrate <b>100</b>. For example, in the case of using a glass substrate as the base substrate <b>100</b>, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set to be higher than or equal to 400° C. and lower than or equal to 750° C.; however, the temperature is not limited thereto as long as the glass substrate can withstand the temperature. This heat treatment can be performed with a heating furnace such as a diffusion furnace or a resistance heating furnace, a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus, a microwave heating apparatus, or the like. In this embodiment, heat treatment is performed at 600° C. for two hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Without performing the above-described heat treatment for strengthening the attachment between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, a heat treatment step for strengthening the attachment between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the insulating layer <b>114</b> and a heat treatment step for separating along the embrittled region <b>112</b> may be performed at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">If surplus moisture remains at the attachment interface between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the surplus moisture is heated and evaporated in the above-described heat treatment step. Accordingly, a void is formed in a portion where the surplus moisture exists. Further, the void may be burst, resulting in a lack of part of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> or the insulating layer <b>114</b>. In this manner, an attachment defect appears in the heat treatment step. However, by heating at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> before attachment of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the amount of moisture on both the substrates can be controlled and thus remaining of surplus moisture at the attachment interface can be suppressed. Accordingly, formation of a void at the attachment interface or a burst of the void can be prevented, so that generation of defects which is caused by surplus moisture and appears in the heat treatment step can be suppressed. Similarly, even when at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is heated and then cooled, the above effect can also be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows variations in the thickness of respective semiconductor layers <b>116</b> separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (Sample A) whose rear surface has been polished by 5 μm, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (Sample B) whose rear surface has been polished by 10 μm, and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> (Sample C) which has not been polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">First, a variation of each semiconductor layer <b>116</b> separated from Samples A to C was measured with a light interferometer thickness measuring device, NanoSpec 6100 (produced by Nanometerics, USA).

The values of 3σ (σ denotes a standard deviation of thickness of the semiconductor layer, which was calculated from the measured values) are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The reason why 3σ that is a triple of the standard deviation σ is used is that the percentage of measured values of a random variable in accordance with a normal distribution with the average and the standard deviation σ, which fell within the range from a standard value −3σ to a standard value +3σ, accounts for 99.7%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, 3σ of Sample A (polished by 5 μm) and 3σ of Sample B (polished by 10 μm) are 1.5 nm and 1.3 nm, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">On the other hand, 3σ of Sample C (silicon wafer without polishing) was 2.2 nm. Since the smaller 3σ is, the smaller the variation is, the thickness variation of either Sample A (polished by 5 μm) or Sample B (polished by 10 μm) is smaller than that of Sample C (silicon wafer without polishing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">It can be confirmed from the above that polishing of the rear surface (opposite to the surface irradiated with the ions <b>103</b>) of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> leads to a reduction in the variation of the thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b>. Specifically, 3σ can be suppressed to less than or equal to 1.5 nm in the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> according to this embodiment where σ is a standard deviation of thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">Next, planarization treatment is preferably performed on the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> of the SOI substrate <b>180</b>. Even when roughness or a defect due to the separation step or the ion irradiation step occurs in a top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b>, the planarization treatment on the SOI substrate <b>180</b> including the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> can planarize the top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">The planarization treatment can be performed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), etching treatment, laser light irradiation, or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">The irradiation with laser light is performed on the top surface side of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b>, whereby the top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is melted, which is followed by cooling of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> to be solidified, so that a semiconductor layer <b>118</b> whose planarity of the top surface is improved can be obtained. Since the laser light is used, the base substrate <b>100</b> is not directly heated, and thus the temperature rise of the base substrate <b>100</b> can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">It is preferable that the melting of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> by laser light irradiation be partial melting. This is because complete melting leads to generation of random nuclei following a change to a liquid phase to cause microcrystallization, bringing a high possibility of a reduction in the crystallinity. On the other hand, partial melting enables crystal growth to proceed from a non-melted solid phase portion; accordingly, defects in the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> can be reduced. The “complete melting” of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> herein means that the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is melted into a liquid state down to the vicinity of its lower interface. On the other hand, the “partial melting” of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> means that the upper portion of the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is melted into a liquid phase while the lower portion thereof is not melted and is still in a solid phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">A pulsed laser is preferably used for the laser light irradiation. This is because high-energy pulsed laser light can be emitted instantaneously to easily melt. The oscillation frequency is preferably set to be greater than or equal to about 1 Hz and less than or equal to about 10 MHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">If surplus moisture remains at the attachment interface between the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the surplus moisture is heated and evaporated in laser light irradiation. Accordingly, a void is formed in a portion where the surplus moisture exists. Further, the void may be burst, leading to a lack of part of the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> or the insulating layer <b>114</b>. In this manner, attachment defects appear in the laser light irradiation. Further, if a void is formed at the attachment interface in the above-described heat treatment step or the laser light irradiation step, the energy distribution of the laser light becomes uneven. Consequently, a bump of the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> or a lack of part of the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> or the insulating layer <b>114</b> may occur. However, by heating at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> before attachment of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, the amount of moisture on both the substrates can be controlled and thus remaining of surplus moisture at the attachment interface can be suppressed. Accordingly, formation of a void at the attachment interface or a burst of the void can be prevented, whereby defects which are caused by surplus moisture and appear in the laser light irradiation step can be reduced. Further, the planarization treatment step with laser light can be favorably performed. Similarly, even when at least one of the base substrate <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is heated and then cooled, the above effect can also be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">After the above-described laser light irradiation, the thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> may be thinned. The semiconductor layer <b>118</b> may be thinned by etching treatment (etch-back treatment) by one or both of dry etching and wet etching. For example, in the case where the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> is formed using a silicon material, the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> can be thinned by dry etching using SF<sub>6 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>as a process gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">The planarization treatment may also be performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>120</b>, in addition to the SOI substrate <b>180</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Although the laser light irradiation on the semiconductor layer <b>116</b> precedes the etching treatment in this embodiment, one embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto: the etching treatment may be performed before the laser light irradiation, or both before and after the laser light irradiation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">In order to control the threshold voltage of a thin film transistor (TFT), a p-type impurity element such as boron, aluminum, or gallium, or an n-type impurity element such as phosphorus or arsenic may be added to the semiconductor layer <b>118</b>. A region to which the impurity element is added and the kind of the impurity element can be determined as appropriate. For example, a p-type impurity element is added to a formation region of an n-channel TFT, and an n-type impurity element is added to a formation region of a p-channel TFT. The impurity element may be added to a dose of about greater than or equal to 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">Then, the semiconductor layer <b>118</b> is separated into island shapes, so that semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Then, an insulating film <b>126</b> is formed to cover the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>). Here, a single layer of a silicon oxide film is formed by a plasma CVD method. Alternatively, a single layer or a stacked layer using a film containing silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, or the like may be formed as the insulating film <b>126</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">As another method for forming the insulating film <b>126</b>, other than a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method or a method using oxidation or nitridation by high density plasma treatment can be given. The high-density plasma treatment is performed using, for example, a mixed gas of a rare gas such as helium, argon, krypton, or xenon and a gas such as oxygen, nitrogen oxide, ammonia, nitrogen, or hydrogen. In that case, by exciting plasma by introduction of microwaves, plasma with a low electron temperature and high density can be generated. Top surfaces of the semiconductor layers are oxidized or nitrided by oxygen radicals (OH radicals may be included) or nitrogen radicals (NH radicals may be included) which are produced by such high-density plasma, whereby an insulating film is formed to a thickness greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 20 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 2 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm so as to be in contact with the semiconductor layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Since the oxidation or nitridation of the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> by the high-density plasma treatment is a solid-phase reaction, the interface state density between the insulating film <b>126</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> can be drastically decreased. Further, with the direct oxidation or nitridation of the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> by the high-density plasma treatment, a variation in the thickness of the insulating film <b>126</b> can be suppressed. Furthermore, since the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are single crystal layers, even when the top surfaces of the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are oxidized by a solid-phase reaction with the high-density plasma treatment, the uniformity and the interface state density of the insulating film <b>126</b> can be increased. The use of the insulating film <b>126</b> formed by the high-density plasma treatment as described above as a part or whole of a gate insulating film of the transistor leads to suppression of variation in characteristics of the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">Alternatively, the gate insulating film may be formed by thermally oxidizing the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">The insulating film <b>126</b> may be formed to contain hydrogen, and hydrogen in the insulating film <b>126</b> may be diffused into the semiconductor layers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> by performing heat treatment at a temperature of higher than or equal to 350° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C. on the insulating film <b>126</b>. In that case, the insulating film <b>126</b> can be formed using silicon nitride or silicon nitride oxide by a plasma CVD method.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Next, a conductive film is formed over the insulating film <b>126</b>, and then, the conductive film is processed (patterned) into a predetermined shape, so that a gate electrode <b>128</b> and a gate electrode <b>130</b> are formed over the semiconductor layer <b>122</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>124</b>, respectively (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>). The conductive film can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. The conductive film can be formed using a material such as tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), or niobium (Nb). An alloy material containing the above-described metal as its main component or a compound containing the above-described metal may also be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">A mask used for forming the gate electrodes <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> may be formed using a material such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride oxide.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">The gate electrodes <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> can also be formed by etching the conductive film to have tapered shapes by an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method with appropriate etching conditions (e.g., the amount of electric power applied to a coiled electrode, the amount of electric power applied to a substrate-side electrode, the temperature of the substrate-side electrode, and the like). The tapered shape can also be adjusted by the shape of a mask.

By forming the conductive film such that an aluminum silicon film is positioned between barrier films, generation of hillocks of aluminum or aluminum silicon can be further prevented. Further, the barrier film may be formed using titanium that is a high reducing element, so that titanium contained in the barrier film can reduce a natural oxide film which may be formed on the semiconductor layer <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, whereby improving the contact between the conductive film <b>147</b> <i>a</i>, <b>147</b> <i>b </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>122</b> and the contact between the conductive film <b>148</b> <i>a</i>, <b>148</b> <i>b </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>124</b>. Further, it is also possible to stack a plurality of barrier films. In that case, for example, each of the conductive films <b>147</b> <i>a</i>, <b>147</b> <i>b</i>, <b>148</b> <i>a</i>, and <b>148</b> <i>b </i>can be formed to have a five-layer structure of titanium, titanium nitride, aluminum silicon, titanium, and titanium nitride in order from the bottom or a stacked-layer structure of more than five layers.</div>
