<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES88593433">
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to the polishing of silicon wafers. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of polishing of a silicon wafer using a chemical mechanical polishing pad comprising a polishing layer, wherein the polishing layer exhibits a density of greater than 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; a Shore D hardness of 5 to 40; an elongation to break of 100 to 450%; and, a cut rate of 25 to 150 μm/hr; and, wherein the polishing layer has a polishing surface adapted for polishing the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry typically require a very high degree of surface perfection before they can be utilized in device manufacture. The silicon wafer surfaces are typically produced using chemical mechanical polishing of the silicon wafer surfaces with a chemical mechanical polishing pad in combination with a polishing slurry. The surface of the silicon wafer being polishing is generally bathed or rinsed in a polishing slurry while the polish surface of a polishing pad is pressed against the surface of the silicon wafer and rotated such that the combined action of the polishing surface and the polishing slurry operates to polishing the surface of the silicon wafer. Ideally, this process results in the selective removal of projecting surface features so that when the process is finished a perfectly planar surface is produced down to the finest level of detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Silicon wafers are typically prepared by a process that includes three polishing steps. First, a double sided “stock removal” polishing step is performed following the sawing, grinding and etching of rough silicon wafers from a cylindrical single crystal silicon ingot; wherein the grinding damage in the single crystal is removed and two planar, parallel surfaces are formed. Typically, about 10 to 20 μm of material are removed from each side of the silicon wafers during this stock removal polishing step. Second, a “final polish” polishing step is performed, wherein the front side of the silicon wafer is polished to remove scratches and handling traces from the stock removal polishing step. Typically, about 100 nm to 5 μm of material is removed from the front side of the silicon wafer during this final polish polishing step. Third, a “haze free” polishing step is performed, wherein the front side of the silicon wafer is polished smooth to an angstrom level as required for microelectronic chip production. Typically, only a 10 to 100 nm of material is removed from the front side of the silicon wafer during this haze free polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The number and permissible size of any surface imperfections on the silicon wafer surface remaining after polishing is continually decreasing. Some of the most critical material specifications for silicon wafers are: the surface metals content, the front surface micro roughness and the total particle per unit area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Conventional polishing pads used for polishing of silicon wafers typically comprise a velour type pad composed of a polyurethane impregnated polyester nonwoven fabric or a poromeric soft urethane foam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">A family of poromeric soft urethane foam type polishing pads are disclosed by Iwase, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,897,250. Iwase et al. discloses a polishing pad comprising a soft urethane foam sheet having foam cells with opened pores formed on a surface of the foam sheet, the opened pores being formed by opening the foam cells by a buffing or slicing process, wherein a percentage of said opened pores having opened pore diameters falling in a range of from between about 30 μm to 50 μm is at least 50% and the number of opened pores per 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>on said surface falls in a range of between about 50 to 100, and at least some of said foam cells have lengths of at least about 70% of a length of the soft urethane sheet in a thickness direction thereof, and wherein an average value of a ratio of diameters of opened pores of the foam cells on the surface on which the opened pores are formed to diameters of the opened pores at a depth position of at least about 200 μm from the surface on which the opened pores are formed falls in a range of from between about 0.65 to 0.95.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Conventional poromeric soft urethane foam polishing pads used for polishing exhibit a tear drop like pore structure, wherein the cross section of the pores parallel to the polishing surface of the polishing layer increases as the polishing layer wears during polishing, which may result in a lack of polishing stability during the life of the polishing pad.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in the following Examples.</div>
<heading>Examples 1-22</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Polishing layers were prepared according to the formulation details provided in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>3. Specifically, polyurethane cakes were prepared by the controlled mixing of the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer at 51° C. (i.e., the Adiprene® LF667 for Examples 1-9 and 20-22 and the Adiprene® LFG963A for Examples 10-19 are available from Chemtura Corporation) with the components of the curative package. The amine initiated polyol curative (i.e., the Voranol® 800 available from The Dow Chemical Company) and the high molecular weight polyol curative (i.e., the Voralux® HF505 available from The Dow Chemical Company) were premixed before blending in the other raw materials. All of the raw materials, except for MBOCA, were maintained at a premixing temperature of 51° C. The MBOCA was maintained at a premixing temperature of 116° C. The ratio of the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer and the curative package was set such that the stoichiometry, as defined by the ratio of active hydrogen groups (i.e., the sum of the —OH groups and —NH<sub>2 </sub>groups) in the curatives to the unreacted isocyanate (NCO) groups in the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer, was as noted in Table 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Porosity was introduced into the polishing layers by adding pore formers to the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer prior to combining with the curative package to achieve the desired porosity and pad density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">The isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer with any incorporated pore former and the curative package were mixed together using a high shear mix head. After exiting the mix head, the combination was dispensed over a period of 5 minutes into an 86.4 cm (34 inch) diameter circular mold to give a total pour thickness of approximately 10 cm (4 inches). The dispensed combination was allowed to gel for 15 minutes before placing the mold in a curing oven. The mold was then cured in the curing oven using the following cycle: 30 minutes ramp from ambient temperature to a set point of 104° C., then hold for 15.5 hours at 104° C., and then 2 hour ramp from 104° C. to 21° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The cured polyurethane cakes were then removed from the mold and skived (cut using a moving blade) at a temperature of 30 to 80° C. into approximately forty separate 2.0 mm (80 mil) thick sheets. Skiving was initiated from the top of each cake. Any incomplete sheets were discarded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Note that Adiprene® LF667 used in the Examples is a PTMEG based isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer comprising a 50/50 weight percent blend of Adiprene® LF950A and Adiprene® LF600D available from Chemtura. Also note that Adiprene® LFG963A is a PPG based isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer available from Chemtura.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The ungrooved, polishing layer materials from each of Examples 1-22 were analyzed to determine their physical properties as reported in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>4. Note that the density data reported were determined according to ASTM D1622; the Shore D hardness data reported were determined according to ASTM D2240; the Shore A hardness data reported were determined according to ASTM D2240; and, the elongation to break data reported were determined according to ASTM D412.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The cut rate data reported in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>4 were measured using a 200 mm Mirra® polishing tool from Applied Materials. This polishing tool is designed to accommodate a circular chemical mechanical polishing pad having a nominal diameter of 51 cm (20 inches). Polishing layers having a circular cross section were prepared as described herein in the Examples. These polishing layers were then machine grooved to provide a groove pattern in the polishing surface comprising a plurality of concentric circular grooves having dimensions of 120 mil (3.05 mm) pitch, 20 mil (0.51 mm) width and 30 mil (0.76 mm) depth. The polishing layers were then laminated to a foam sub-pad layer (SP2310 available from Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials CMP Inc.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">A diamond conditioning disk (DiaGrid® AD3CL-150840-3 pad conditioner manufactured by Kinik Company) was used to abrade the polishing surface of the grooved polishing layers using the following process conditions: the polishing surface of the polishing layers were subjected to continuous abrasion from the diamond conditioning disk for a period of 2 hours, with a platen speed of 100 rpm, a deionized water flow rate of 150 cm<sup>3</sup>/min and a conditioning disk down force of 48.3 kPa (7 psi). The cut rate was determined by measuring the change in the average groove depth over time. The groove depth was measured (in μm/hour) using an MTI Instruments Microtrack II Laser Triangulation Sensor mounted on a Zaber Technologies Motorized Slide to profile the polishing surface of each polishing layer from the center to the outer edge. The sweep speed of the sensor on the slide was 0.732 mm/s and the sampling rate (measurements/mm of sweep) for the sensor was 6.34 points/mm. The cut rate reported in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>4 is the arithmetic average reduction in groove depth over time, based on the collected thickness measurements taken as &gt;2,000 points across the polishing surface of the polishing layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">These polishing experiments were performed using 200 mm Si(100) wafers, which were pre-etched in a 0.5 wt % hydrofluoric acid solution for 90 seconds, using a 20″ platen polisher (Strasbaugh) and a polishing layer prepared according to Examples 20-22, respectively, wherein the polishing surface of each polishing layer exhibited an XY type groove pattern having a 0.6 mm depth, 2.5 mm width and 15.75 mm pitch; with a down force of 9.8 kPa, a chemical mechanical polishing composition flow rate of 300 ml/min, a table rotation speed of 115 rpm and a carrier rotation speed of 100 rpm. The chemical mechanical polishing composition used was NP8030 (1:30 dilution ratio) (commercially available from Nitta Haas Inc.). In each of Polishing Examples P1-P3, the front surface of the silicon wafer was polishing under the noted conditions for five (5) minutes. The polished front surface of each of the silicon wafers was then analyzed for haze using an LS6600 unpatterned wafer inspection system available from Hitachi High Technologies Corporation. The results are provided in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">These polishing experiments were performed using 300 mm Si(100) wafers, which were pre-etched in a 0.5 wt % hydrofluoric acid solution for 90 seconds, using an 800 mm platen polisher (SPP800S Okamoto) and a polishing layers identified in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>6 with a down force of 9.8 kPa, a chemical mechanical polishing composition flow rate of 1 L/min, a table rotation speed of 40 rpm and a carrier rotation speed of 39 rpm. The chemical mechanical polishing composition used was NP8030 (1:30 dilution ratio) (commercially available from Nitta Haas Inc.). In each of Comparative Polish Examples PA1-PA2 and Polishing Examples P4-P9, the front surface of the silicon wafer was polishing under the noted conditions for five (5) minutes. The polished front surface of each of the silicon wafers was then analyzed for haze using an LS6600 unpatterned wafer inspection system available from Hitachi High Technologies Corporation. The results are provided in T<smallcaps>ABLE </smallcaps>7.</div>
