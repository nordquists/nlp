<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present technology relates to semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The strong growth in demand for portable consumer electronics is driving the need for high-capacity storage devices. Non-volatile semiconductor memory devices, such as flash memory storage cards, are becoming widely used to meet the ever-growing demands on digital information storage and exchange. Their portability, versatility and rugged design, along with their high reliability and large capacity, have made such memory devices ideal for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, including for example digital cameras, digital music players, video game consoles, PDAs and cellular telephones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">While a wide variety of packaging configurations are known, flash memory storage cards may in general be fabricated from so-called 3-D semiconductor devices, including for example a system-in-a-package (SiP) or a multichip module (MCM), where a plurality of die are mounted on a substrate in a stacked configuration. Edge views of conventional 3-D semiconductor packages <b>20</b> (without molding compound) are shown in prior art <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Typical packages include a plurality of semiconductor die <b>22</b> mounted to a substrate <b>26</b>. In the examples shown, the die stack has four die, <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, <b>22</b> <i>c </i>and <b>22</b> <i>d</i>. Further examples have more or less die in the stack. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the semiconductor die <b>22</b> are formed with die bond pads on an upper surface of the die. Substrate <b>26</b> may be formed of an electrically insulating core sandwiched between upper and lower conductive layers. The upper and/or lower conductive layers may be etched to form conductance patterns including electrical leads and contact pads. Wire bonds <b>30</b> are soldered between the die bond pads of the semiconductor die <b>22</b> and the contact pads of the substrate <b>26</b> to electrically couple the semiconductor die to the substrate. The electrical leads on the substrate in turn provide an electrical path between the die and a host device. Once electrical connections between the die and substrate are made, the assembly is then typically encased in a molding compound to provide a protective package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Semiconductor die are batch processed from silicon wafers. A wafer includes an active surface, in which the integrated circuits of the semiconductor die are formed, and an inactive surface, or backside, opposite the active surface. During fabrication, impurities are introduced into semiconductor wafers which can degrade the performance of the finished semiconductor die and reduce yield of acceptable devices. At elevated temperatures, these impurities become more mobile and tend to gravitate toward stress concentration areas in a wafer where they become trapped. It is therefore known to create stress concentration areas away from the active surface of the wafer, in a process known as gettering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">There are two broad categories of gettering: intrinsic gettering and extrinsic gettering. Intrinsic gettering is achieved by providing gettering sites within the interior of the wafer, away from the active surface. Some commonly known approaches include providing oxygen precipitates within the bulk silicon that serve as gettering sites. Extrinsic gettering is a process whereby dislocations and crystal disorders are created on the inactive surface of the wafer. These intentionally created disorders result in stress concentration areas which act as effective traps for the impurities to keep them away from the active surface of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One problem with known extrinsic gettering processes is that the creation of dislocations and stress concentrations is poorly controlled. As the thicknesses of semiconductor wafers are getting smaller and smaller, stress concentrations formed by conventional extrinsic gettering processes can result in a weakening of the wafer to the point of cracking or other mechanical failure of the wafer. Coming at the end of the wafer fabrication process, such failure has a high cost and can result in a significant reduction in yield.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 11</figref>, which relate to extrinsic gettering within a semiconductor wafer and a semiconductor package formed with die therefrom. It is understood that the present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the invention to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents of these embodiments, which are included within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The terms “top,” “bottom,” “upper,” “lower,” “vertical” and/or “horizontal” as may be used herein are for convenience and illustrative purposes only, and are not meant to limit the description of the invention inasmuch as the referenced item can be exchanged in position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A process for forming semiconductor wafers in accordance with the present technology will now be described with reference to the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the various views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 10</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a semiconductor wafer <b>100</b>, and in particular an active surface <b>102</b> on which a plurality of semiconductor die <b>104</b> (one of which is labeled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are batch processed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an inactive surface <b>106</b>, opposite the active surface <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The integrated circuit components of semiconductor die <b>104</b> may be formed on the active surface <b>102</b> of wafer <b>100</b> in step <b>200</b> by known processes such as film deposition, photolithography, patterning, and diffusion of impurities. Die bond pads (not shown) may then be formed in respective die in step <b>204</b> by known processes including but not limited to plating, evaporation, screen printing, or various deposition processes. As is known, the bond pads are used to electrically couple the semiconductor die <b>104</b> to other semiconductor die, or to a printed circuit board, leadframe or other substrate as explained hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In a step <b>206</b>, a coarse backgrind process may be performed on the inactive surface <b>106</b> of wafer <b>100</b>. In particular, a tape may be applied to the active surface <b>102</b> to protect the defined semiconductor die <b>104</b>. Thereafter, the taped active surface <b>102</b> may be placed in contact with a chuck <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The wafer <b>100</b> may be clamped to the chuck <b>110</b> by various known methods including by a vacuum communicated to the surface of the chuck from a vacuum source <b>114</b>. The chuck <b>110</b> may be rotated by a drive mechanism <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The chuck <b>110</b> and wafer <b>100</b> may then be positioned within a rough backgrind station <b>118</b> including a rotating backgrind wheel <b>120</b>. The wheel <b>120</b> may be lowered into contact with the inactive surface <b>106</b> of the wafer as the wafer is rotating on the chuck <b>110</b> to grind down the backside of the wafer to a desired thickness. Backgrind wheel <b>120</b> may have a coarse surface <b>122</b> covered for example with a <b>320</b> grit diamond grinding disk. The coarse backgrind step <b>206</b> may thin the wafer <b>100</b> from an initial thickness of 760 μm down to 82 μm. It is understood that starting and ending thicknesses of the wafer <b>100</b> for the coarse backgrind step <b>206</b> may be larger or smaller than these values in further embodiments. It is further understood that the coarse backgrind process of step <b>206</b> may be performed with other instruments, or with other coarse grinding materials, in further embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In step <b>210</b>, a fine backgrind process may be performed on the inactive surface <b>106</b>. The chuck <b>110</b> and wafer <b>100</b> may be moved to the fine backgrind station including a rotating backgrind wheel as in wheel <b>120</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternatively, the fine backgrind process may be performed in the same station as the coarse backgrind process. The backgrind wheel of step <b>210</b> may smooth out some of the irregularities left by the coarse backgrind process. In embodiments, the backgrind wheel of step <b>210</b> may include for example a 2000 grit diamond grinding disk. The fine backgrind step <b>210</b> may thin the wafer <b>100</b> from an initial thickness of 82 μm down to 52 μm. It is understood that starting and ending thicknesses of the wafer <b>100</b> for the fine backgrind step <b>210</b> may be larger or smaller than these values in further embodiments. It is further understood that the fine backgrind process of step <b>210</b> may be performed with other instruments, or with other fine grinding materials, in further embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In conventional systems, the surface of the wafer may be left as is after the fine backgrind process of step <b>210</b> in order to provide extrinsic gettering sites to capture impurities within the wafer <b>100</b>. However, the inactive surface <b>106</b> of the wafer after step <b>210</b> may have poorly controlled stress concentrations, some of which may be undesirably large. These large stress concentrations may mechanically weaken the wafer <b>100</b> which may lead to wafer cracking in later assembly processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Therefore, the present technology further includes a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) step <b>212</b> for polishing the inactive surface <b>106</b> to remove the stress concentration points left after the fine backgrind process of step <b>210</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a view of portions of a processing station <b>130</b> for performing the CMP step <b>212</b>. The chuck <b>110</b> with wafer <b>100</b> still mounted thereon is transferred into the station <b>130</b>. A polishing wheel <b>132</b> polishes the inactive surface <b>106</b> with the aid of a slurry <b>134</b>, which is introduced into the station as the chuck <b>110</b> and polishing wheel <b>132</b> rotate in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The polishing wheel <b>132</b> may have a polishing pad, which in embodiments may for example be or include a polyurethane cloth. Other known materials may be used as the polishing surface on polishing wheel <b>132</b>. The slurry <b>134</b> polishes the inactive surface <b>106</b> under pressure from the polishing wheel <b>132</b>. In embodiments, the slurry <b>134</b> may be comprised of a silica (silicon dioxide) slurry, with silica particle sizes of 0.05 μm to 0.1 μm. Other types of slurry may be used, and other particle sizes (both larger and smaller) may be used, in further embodiments. Upon completion of the polishing step <b>212</b>, the inactive surface <b>106</b> may have a mirror finish, with the stress concentration points having been removed from the inactive surface <b>106</b>. It is understood that the polishing step <b>212</b> may be performed by other methods and by other mechanisms in further embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">As discussed in the Background section, impurities can migrate to the active surface of a wafer <b>100</b> where they can degrade performance and negatively impact yield. Therefore, in accordance with the present technology, after the polishing step <b>212</b>, a texturing step <b>216</b> may be performed on the inactive surface <b>106</b> to provide textured sites which attract and trap impurities. A texturing process is described hereinafter with respect to a processing station <b>140</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). However, as discussed below, the texturing process may be performed in the same station as the polishing process in further embodiments. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the chuck <b>110</b> with wafer <b>100</b> still mounted thereon may be transferred into the station <b>140</b>. A texturing wheel <b>146</b> is provided to texture the inactive surface <b>106</b> with the aid of a slurry <b>148</b>, which may be introduced into the station as the chuck <b>110</b> and texturing wheel <b>146</b> rotate in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The texturing wheel <b>146</b> may have a texturing pad which may for example be or include a polyurethane cloth. In embodiments where the texturing step <b>216</b> is performed in the same station as the polishing step <b>212</b>, the same pad may be used for both the polishing and texturing steps. Other known materials may be used as the texturing surface on texturing wheel <b>146</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The polishing and texturing steps <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> may thin the wafer <b>100</b> from an initial thickness of 52 μm down to a final wafer thickness of 50 μm. It is understood that starting and ending thicknesses of the wafer <b>100</b> for the polishing and texturing steps <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> may be larger or smaller than these values in further embodiments. In one further embodiment, the coarse backgrind process may thin the wafer from 760 μm down to 72 μm; the fine backgrind process may thin the wafer from 72 μm down to 42 μm; and the polishing and texturing steps may reduce the wafer thickness down from 42 μm to a final thickness of 40 μm. Again, other thicknesses at the start and finish of each process are contemplated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The slurry <b>148</b> provides a texture to the inactive surface <b>106</b> when the slurry is rubbed against the inactive surface <b>106</b> by the texturing wheel <b>146</b>. In embodiments, the texturing slurry may be comprised of different materials including a mixture of cerium dioxide, a surfactant and water. The mixture may be 98% to 99% water, with the remaining composition of the mixture split between the cerium dioxide and surfactant. Such a texturing slurry is made by Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan under the trade name EG-2. In further embodiments, the mixture may be a smaller percentage of water, or a greater percentage of water, up to for example 99.9% water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The cerium dioxide particles may for example have a size of 0.07 μm to 1.0 μm. The size of the particles in the slurry may vary to be smaller than that or larger than that, for example up to a few microns, with the provision that the particles in the texturing slurry be larger than the particles used in the polishing slurry. Moreover, it is understood that a variety of compositions other than, or in addition to, cerium dioxide may be used in the texturing slurry, including for example silica, alumina (aluminum oxide), boron oxide, carbon crystal and diamond, silicon carbide and other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The texturing step <b>216</b> creates limited backside damage on the already mirror finished wafer. The degree of texturing provides a balance between attracting impurities and maintaining wafer strength. In embodiments, the degree of texturing is sufficient to attract impurities while keeping wafer strength sufficiently high to avoid any appreciable risk of the wafer breaking due to the texturing step <b>216</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of a texturing pattern <b>150</b> formed on inactive surface <b>106</b> in accordance with the texturing step <b>216</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an enlarged portion of the pattern <b>150</b>. In one embodiment, the texturing creates diamond-shaped, or other quadrilateral-shaped, regions <b>152</b> having borders defined by the textured lines <b>154</b>. The lines are defined by the particles of slurry <b>148</b> as both the chuck <b>110</b> and texturing wheel <b>146</b> rotate in contact with each other. The textured lines <b>154</b> may appear straight at the magnification of the view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, but the lines may curve across the diameter of the wafer <b>100</b> in embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the distance, x, for portions of the wafer <b>100</b> may for example be 3.3 μm, while the distance, y, for portions of the wafer may for example be 1.8 μm. These distances are by way of example only and may vary in further embodiments. These distances may also vary proportionately and disproportionately across the wafer <b>100</b>. In embodiments, the depth of a texturing line may for example be between 1 and 10 nanometers, though the depth may be smaller or greater than that in further embodiments, with the provision that the depth not exceed a threshold at which breaking of the wafer due to the texturing damage becomes a realistic possibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Most current extrinsic gettering techniques compromise the wafer/die strength of thin wafers due to stress concentration points left on the wafer backside. The current invention first provides good stress relief using CMP slurry in polishing step <b>212</b> before the wafer backside goes through a limited damage texturing step <b>216</b> providing a desired and controllable amount of damage to the backside of wafer <b>100</b>. This process provides trapping of impurities on the inactive surface <b>106</b> of wafer <b>100</b>, while also providing good mechanical strength on the wafer/die leading to higher yields in assembly and subsequently better product reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, traditional intrinsic and extrinsic gettering processes have been performed on semiconductor wafers which are thicker than that contemplated in the present technology. One issue with wafer thicknesses below for example 100 μm is that there is not enough bulk within the interior of the wafer for intrinsic gettering techniques to be effective. Therefore, the present technology provides a novel process for extrinsic gettering of thin semiconductor die, having thicknesses for example below 100 μm, including for example 70 μm, 60 μm, 50 μm and 40 μm, and thicknesses in between these values. The wafer <b>100</b> and die <b>104</b> may be thinner than 40 μm in further embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the steps described above, the inactive surface <b>106</b> of wafer <b>100</b> is first polished in step <b>212</b> to remove all stress concentration points, and then the inactive surface is textured a controlled amount in step <b>216</b>. In further embodiments, the polishing step <b>212</b> and texturing step <b>216</b> may be combined into a single process. In this single process, the polishing slurry described above may be mixed with the texturing slurring described above, so that the polishing and texturing steps occur concurrently. As an alternative, the polishing step <b>212</b> may be performed, the wafer may be rinsed, and then, in the same station (for example station <b>130</b> or <b>140</b>), the texturing step <b>216</b> may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">After the texturing of the inactive side <b>106</b> of the wafer <b>100</b>, the wafer may be removed from the chuck <b>110</b>, and the protective tape may be removed from the active surface <b>102</b> of the wafer <b>100</b>. In step <b>220</b>, the die <b>104</b> on wafer <b>100</b> may be tested for functional defects. Such tests include for example wafer final test, electronic die sort and circuit probe. In step <b>224</b>, each of the die <b>104</b> may be diced from the wafer <b>100</b>. In order to perform the dicing operation, the wafer may be mounted on a dicing tape attached to a precision X-Y translating table (not shown). The cuts may then be made by any of a variety of cutting methods, including by a saw, laser, water jet or laser microjet that incorporates a laser into a thin water-jet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The die <b>104</b>, formed and diced from wafer <b>100</b> as described above, may for example be non-volatile memory die, such as for example NAND flash memory die. However, the die <b>104</b> formed as described above can be other types of semiconductor die in further embodiments, such as for example, NOR, DRAM, various other memory die and various controller die. Referring now to the side view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, where die <b>104</b> are memory die, they may be formed into a semiconductor package <b>160</b> by stacking the die <b>104</b> on a substrate <b>162</b> after dicing, together with a controller die <b>164</b>. The die stack may then be electrically coupled to the substrate for example by wire bonds <b>166</b>. In further embodiments, one or more die <b>104</b> may be electrically coupled to the substrate <b>162</b> via flip-chip technology. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows four semiconductor die <b>104</b>, though there may be more or less die in the package <b>160</b> in further embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">After electrical coupling, the die stack may be encased within the molding compound <b>168</b>. The substrate <b>162</b> may initially be included in a panel of substrates to allow batch processing of the packages <b>160</b>. After encapsulation, the individual packages <b>160</b> may be singulated to form the finished semiconductor packages. In some embodiments, the finished package <b>160</b> may optionally be enclosed within a lid. The package <b>160</b> may be used in a plurality of standard memory cards, including without limitation a CompactFlash card, a SmartMedia card, a Memory Stick, a Secure Digital card, a miniSD card, a microSD card, a USB memory card and others.</div>
