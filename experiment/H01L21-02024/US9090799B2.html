<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing composition mainly used in an application of polishing a semiconductor substrate, such as a silicon wafer, with a polishing pad, and also relates to a method for polishing a semiconductor substrate using the polishing composition.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally in polishing of a semiconductor substrate, such as a silicon wafer, not only improvement of surface quality in accordance with realization of higher performance and higher integration density of semiconductor devices but improvement of manufacturing efficiency for accommodating recent increases in demand is also considered to be an important theme. In order to respond to this theme, for example, piperazine is used for improving a polishing rate in a polishing composition disclosed in Patent Document 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">However, a polishing pad used to polish a semiconductor substrate becomes clogged readily due to repeated use, and the clogging may reduce the processing efficiency of the semiconductor substrate and degrade the surface quality of the semiconductor substrate. When the polishing pad becomes clogged, the polishing process must be interrupted and removal of clogging by dressing or exchange of the polishing pad must be performed, thereby lowering the manufacturing efficiency of the semiconductor substrate. Therefore, for example with the polishing composition disclosed in Patent Document 2, a mixed solvent of water and alcohol is used for preventing aggregation and sedimentation of polishing particles in the polishing composition and suppressing precipitation of piperazine, which is used as a polishing promoter in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, clogging of the polishing pad occurs not only due to components in the polishing composition used but may also occur due to polishing debris generated from the semiconductor substrate by the polishing of the semiconductor substrate. With the polishing compositions disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, it is difficult to prevent the clogging of the polishing pad caused by the polishing debris.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0007">The present invention is based on a finding, resulting from diligent research by the inventors, that clogging of a polishing pad caused by polishing debris generated from a semiconductor substrate can be prevented by using a polishing composition containing abrasive grains, at least one type of alcohol compound selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols with 2 to 6 carbon atoms and glycol ethers with 3 to 10 carbon atoms, and at least one type of basic compound selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts and alkali metal salts. An objective of the present invention is to provide a polishing composition capable of being used more favorably in polishing of a semiconductor substrate and a method for polishing a semiconductor substrate using such a polishing composition.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0008">To achieve the above objective and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a polishing composition is provided containing abrasive grains, at least one type of alcohol compound selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols with 2 to 6 carbon atoms and glycol ethers with 3 to 10 carbon atoms, at least one type of basic compound selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts and alkali metal salts, and water, wherein the abrasive grains have an average primary particle diameter of 5 to 50 nm, and the alcohol compound is contained in the polishing composition in an amount of 0.01 to 1% by mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for polishing a semiconductor substrate surface using the polishing composition of the above aspect is provided.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0010">An embodiment of the present invention will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0011">A polishing composition according to the present embodiment is prepared by mixing abrasive grains, an alcohol compound, and a basic compound in water. The polishing composition thus contains abrasive grains, an alcohol compound, a basic compound, and water. The polishing composition is mainly used in an application of polishing the surface of a semiconductor substrate, such as a silicon wafer, and is particularly used in preliminary polishing, such as primary polishing or secondary polishing, performed on a semiconductor substrate surface before final polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">&lt;Abrasive Grains&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0012">The abrasive grains contained in the polishing composition have a function of physically polishing a semiconductor substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0013">Examples of abrasive grains that can be used include silicon dioxide, alumina, ceria, zirconia, diamond, and silicon carbide, although not limited thereto. In particular, use of silicon dioxide, such as colloidal silica, fumed silica, and sol-gel derived silica, is preferable in that the roughness of the semiconductor substrate surface is reduced more than in cases of using other types of abrasive grains. Also, use of colloidal silica or fumed silica and especially use of colloidal silica is preferable in that scratches formed on the semiconductor substrate surface are lessened. One type of abrasive grains may be used alone or two or more types may be used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0014">The abrasive grains used may have spherical shapes or may have non-spherical shapes. Examples of a non-spherical shape include a so-called cocoon shape having a constriction at a central portion and a spherical shape with a plurality of protrusions on its surface, although not limited thereto. Use of abrasive grains of non-spherical shapes is preferable in that the polishing rate is more improved. Two or more types of abrasive grains differing in shape may be used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0015">The abrasive grains used is required to have an average primary particle diameter of no less than 5 nm, which is determined from the specific surface area measured by a method (BET method) for measuring a specific surface area of a powder by gas adsorption. It is not practical for the average primary particle diameter to be less than 5 nm because the stability of the polishing composition is impaired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0016">Also the average primary particle diameter of the abrasive grains is required to be no more than 50 nm, is preferably no more than 35 nm, and is more preferably no more than 20 nm. In a case where the average primary particle diameter exceeds 50 nm, clogging of the polishing pad caused by the abrasive grains may worsen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">&lt;Alcohol Compound&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0017">The alcohol compound contained in the polishing composition is at least one type of compound selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols with 2 to 6 carbon atoms and glycol ethers with 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The alcohol compound adsorbs to the semiconductor substrate surface during polishing to adjust the rate of polishing of the semiconductor substrate with the polishing composition and thereby functions to suppress clogging of the polishing pad caused by polishing debris generated from the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0018">Examples of aliphatic alcohols with 2 to 6 carbon atoms include ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, pentanol, hexanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerin, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, erythritol, D-threitol, L-threilol, D-arabinitol, L-arabinitol, ribitol, xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol. Among these, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, pentanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerin, 1,2,4-butanetriol, and 1,2,6-hexanetriol, which are monovalent to trivalent alcohols, are preferable, and ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol are more preferable. Also, from a standpoint of improving the polishing rate with the polishing composition, ethanol is most preferable, and from a standpoint of improving a slurry stability of the polishing composition, 1-propanol and 2-propanol are most preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0019">Examples of glycol ethers with 3 to 10 carbon atoms include methyl glycol, methyl diglycol, methyl triglycol, isopropyl glycol, isopropyl diglycol, butyl glycol, butyl diglycol, butyl triglycol, isobutyl glycol, isobutyl diglycol, hexyl glycol, hexyl diglycol, 2-ethylhexyl glycol, 2-ethylhexyl diglycol, aryl glycol, phenyl glycol, phenyl diglycol, benzyl glycol, methylpropylene glycol, methylpropylene diglycol, methylpropylene triglycol, propylpropylene glycol, propylpropylene diglycol, butylpropylene glycol, butylpropylene diglycol, and phenylpropylene glycol. Among these, methyl glycol, methyl diglycol, isopropyl glycol, aryl glycol, and methylpropylene glycol are preferable, and methyl diglycol is more preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0020">In comparison to aliphatic alcohols with 2 to 6 carbons, glycol ethers with 3 to 10 carbon atoms have an advantage of having an action of improving the stability of the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0021">Methanol, which is an aliphatic alcohol with 1 carbon atom, is low in ability to adsorb to the semiconductor substrate surface due to being low in molecular weight and therefore does not have a function of suppressing the clogging of the polishing pad. Also, an aliphatic alcohol with no less than 7 carbon atoms cannot be used favorably due to being difficult to dissolve in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0022">A glycol ether with no more than 2 carbon atoms is not available for industrial use. A glycol ether with no less than 11 carbon atoms cannot be used favorably due to being difficult to dissolve in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0023">The content of the alcohol compound in the polishing composition is required to be no less than 0.01% by mass, is preferably no less than 0.02% by mass, and is more preferably no less than 0.05% by mass. In a case where the alcohol compound content is less than 0.01% by mass, an amount of the alcohol compound adsorbed to the semiconductor substrate surface during polishing is low and suppression of polishing pad clogging by the alcohol compound is thus insufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0024">Also the content of the alcohol compound in the polishing composition is required to be no more than 1% by mass and is preferably no more than 0.07% mass. An alcohol compound content exceeding 1% by mass is not practical in that the polishing rate decreases significantly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Basic Compound&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0025">The basic compound contained in the polishing composition is at least one type of basic compound selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts and alkali metal salts. The basic compound has a function of chemically polishing the semiconductor substrate. Also, the basic compound has a high ability to disperse polishing debris generated from the semiconductor substrate and therefore also has a function of suppressing clogging of the polishing pad caused by the polishing debris.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0026">Examples of quaternary ammonium salts include hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates of quaternary ammonium, and more specifically include tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium carbonate, and tetramethylammonium bicarbonate. Among these, tetramethylammonium hydroxide is preferable from a standpoint of improving the polishing rate with the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0027">Examples of alkali metal salts include hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates of alkali metals, and more specifically include potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium carbonate. Among these, potassium salts are preferable for reducing metal contamination of the semiconductor substrate after polishing and among potassium salts, potassium hydroxide, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium carbonate are more preferable and potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate are even more preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0028">In a case where a quaternary ammonium salt and an alkali metal salt are used in combination, a polishing composition with which improvement of the polishing rate and reduction of metal contamination of the semiconductor substrate after polishing are well-balanced can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0029">The content of the basic compound in the polishing composition is preferably no less than 0.001% by mass and more preferably no less than 0.15% by mass. As the basic compound content increases, the rate of polishing of the semiconductor substrate with the polishing composition improves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0030">Also, the content of the basic compound in the polishing composition is preferably no more than 0.5% by mass and more preferably no more than 0.2% by mass. As the basic compound content decreases, the surface roughness of the semiconductor substrate after polishing decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0031">The pH of the polishing composition is preferably no less than 8.5 and more preferably no less than 10.0. When the pH of the polishing composition is no less than 8.5 and moreover when the pH is no less than 10.0, a polishing rate of an especially favorable level in terms of practical use can be obtained readily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0032">Also, the pH of the polishing composition is preferably no more than 11.5 and more preferably no more than 11.0. When the pH of the polishing composition is no more than 11.5 and moreover when the pH is no more than 11.0, a polishing rate of an especially favorable level in terms of practical use can also be obtained readily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0033">A pH adjuster may be used to adjust the pH of the polishing composition to a desired value. The basic compound may also be used as a pH adjuster.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">&lt;Water&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0034">The water contained in the polishing composition has a function of dissolving or dispersing the other components in the polishing composition. Preferably, the water is, as far as possible, free of impurities that inhibit the actions of the other components. Specifically, ion-exchanged water, with which impurity ions have been removed using an ion exchange resin and foreign matter has thereafter been removed by passage through a filter, pure water, ultrapure water, and distilled water are preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0035">Examples of the semiconductor wafer polished using the polishing composition include silicon wafers, germanium wafers, silicon-germanium wafers, and compound semiconductor (GaAs, InAs, GaN) wafers, although not limited there to. Among these, the polishing composition is favorably used in an application of polishing a silicon wafer, a germanium wafer, a silicon-germanium wafer, and a GaAs wafer, which are chemically polished readily by the basic compound, and is especially favorably used in an application of polishing a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0036">When a semiconductor substrate surface is to be polished using the polishing composition, the semiconductor substrate and a polishing pad are rotated in a state where the polishing pad is pressed against the semiconductor substrate surface while the polishing composition is being supplied to the semiconductor substrate surface. In this process, the semiconductor substrate surface is polished by a physical action due to friction between the polishing pad and the semiconductor substrate surface or friction between the abrasive grains in the polishing composition and the semiconductor substrate surface and a chemical action due to the basic compound in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0037">The polishing composition may be a single component type or a multiple component type, such as a two-component type. In a case of a two-component type polishing composition, it may be provided in a form of a kit including a first component containing the abrasive grains and the basic compound and a second component containing the alcohol compound. The first component and the second component may be mixed mutually in advance and then supplied to a polishing machine or the first component and the second component may be supplied to the polishing machine separately. In a case where the first component and the second component are supplied to the polishing machine separately, it is preferable for the first component to be supplied to the substrate surface continuously from a start of polishing of the substrate surface and thereafter, and for the second component to be supplied only after the start of polishing of the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0038">The polishing composition used in polishing the semiconductor substrate surface may be recovered and reused (put into cyclical use). More specifically, the used polishing composition discharged from the polishing machine may be recovered once in a tank and then supplied from the tank to the polishing machine again. In this case, a need to treat the used polishing composition as a waste liquid is lessened and reduction of environmental load and reduction of cost are made possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0039">In putting the polishing composition into cyclical use, a reduced amount of at least any one of the abrasive grains, the alcohol compound, and the basic compound in the polishing composition that are consumed or lost by being used in polishing the semiconductor substrate surface may be replenished. The replenishment may be performed by adding the abrasive grains, the alcohol compound, or the basic compound to the used polishing composition or by adding a mixture containing at least two of the abrasive grains, the alcohol compound, and the basic compound at suitable concentrations to the used polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">The following advantages are provided by the present embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041">A polishing composition according to the present embodiment contains an alcohol compound that adsorbs to a semiconductor substrate surface during polishing and can thereby adjust the rate of polishing of the semiconductor substrate with the polishing composition. A basic compound that has a high ability to disperse polishing debris generated from the semiconductor substrate is also contained. Therefore by the present polishing composition, clogging of the polishing pad caused by polishing debris generated from the semiconductor substrate can be suppressed. The present polishing composition can thus be used favorably in an application of polishing a semiconductor substrate surface and particularly in preliminary polishing that is performed on a semiconductor substrate surface before final polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">The above embodiment may be modified as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">The polishing composition according to the embodiment may further contain a chelating agent. In a case where a chelating agent is contained, metal contamination of the semiconductor substrate by the polishing composition can be suppressed. Examples of chelating agents that can be used include aminocarboxylic acid chelating agents and organophosphonic acid chelating agents. Examples of aminocarboxylic acid chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium nitrilotriacetate, ammonium nitrilotriacetate, hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, sodium hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, sodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, triethylenetetraminehexaacetic acid, and sodium triethylenetetraminehexaacetate. Examples of organophosphonic acid chelating agents include 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid, 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid), ethylenediaminetetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid), diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonic acid), ethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid, ethane-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, ethane-1,2-dicarboxy-1,2-diphosphonic acid, methanehydroxyphosphonic acid, 2-phosphonobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, 1-phosphonobutane-2,3,4-tricarboxylic acid, and α-methylphosphonosuccinic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044">The polishing composition according to the embodiment may further contain as necessary, a known additive, such as a preservative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0045">The polishing composition according to the embodiment may be in a concentrated state during manufacture and during marketing. That is, the polishing composition according to the embodiment may be manufactured and marketed in a form of an undiluted polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0046">The polishing composition according to the embodiment may be prepared by diluting the undiluted polishing composition with water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0047">As the polishing pad used in polishing the semiconductor substrate surface with the polishing composition according to the embodiment, any type of polishing pad, such as a polyurethane type, non-woven fabric type, and suede type, may be used and a type containing abrasive grains or a type not containing abrasive grains may be used.</div>

Results of evaluation of the calculated values according to a five-point scale of A to E are also shown in the same column. “A” indicates that the cumulative polishing removal amount was greater than 3000 μm, “B” indicates that the cumulative polishing removal amount was no more than 3000 μm and greater than 2500 μm, “C” indicates that the cumulative polishing removal amount was no more than 2500 μm/minute and greater than 1700 μm, “D” indicates that the cumulative polishing removal amount was no more than 1700 μm/minute and greater than 1500 μm, and “E” indicates that the cumulative polishing removal amount was no more than 1500 μm. “X” indicates that evaluation was not possible because the alcohol compound used did not dissolve in the polishing composition and further use of the polishing composition was interrupted. The value of the polishing rate decreases as more batches are polished due to progress of clogging of the polishing pad. Therefore, a greater value of the cumulative polishing removal amount indicates that the progress of clogging of the polishing pad was slower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">&lt;Measurement and Evaluation of Surface Roughness&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0073">The surface roughness of the silicon wafer after polishing of the first batch was measured by TMS-3000-WRC, made by Schmitt Measurement Systems. Inc. The measured values are shown in the “Surface roughness” column of Table 1. Results of evaluation of the measured values according to a five-point scale of A to E are also shown in the same column. “A” indicates that the surface roughness was less than 5.5 Å, “B” indicates that the surface roughness was no less than 5.5 Å and less than 6.0 Å, “C” indicates that the surface roughness was no less than 6.0 Å and less than 6.5 Å, “D” indicates that the surface roughness was no less than 6.5 Å and less than 7.0 Å, and “E” indicates that the surface roughness was no less than 7.0 Å. “X” indicates that evaluation was not possible because the alcohol compound used did not dissolve in the polishing composition and further use of the polishing composition was interrupted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">&lt;Evaluation of Stability&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0074">A 10-times concentrate of each of the polishing compositions of Examples 1 to 31 and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 was stored at 25° C., and after 1 month of storage, a diluted solution, obtained by diluting the concentrate by 10 times with ion-exchanged water, was used to calculate the value of the polishing rate by the same method described in the &lt;Calculation and evaluation of polishing rate&gt; section. Results of evaluation of the calculated values according to a five-point scale of A to E are shown in the “Stability” column of Table 1. “A” indicates that the calculated value was no less than −10% to less than +10% with respect to the value indicated in the “Polishing rate” column and “B” indicates that the calculated value was no less than −20% to less than −10% or no less than +10% to less than 20%. “X” indicates that evaluation was not possible because the alcohol compound used did not dissolve in the polishing composition and further use of the polishing composition was interrupted.</div>
