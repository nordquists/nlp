<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polishing head for holding a workpiece when a front surface of the workpiece is polished and a polishing apparatus provided with the polishing head, particularly to a polishing head for holding a workpiece on an elastic film and a polishing apparatus with the polishing head.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, higher integration of semiconductor devices places demand for higher flatness of semiconductor wafers used in such devices. The higher flatness up to near the edge of wafers is also needed to raise the yield of semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The shape of finished semiconductor wafers depends on a final mirror polishing process. For a 300-mm-diameter silicon wafer, in particular, primary polishing by double-side polishing is performed to meet strict specifications of the flatness, and then secondary polishing and finish polishing by single-side polishing are performed to remove scratches on a wafer surface or to improve surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The secondary polishing and finish polishing by single-side polishing need to maintain or improve flatness obtained by the primary polishing by double-side polishing and to finish the front surface of a wafer into a perfect mirror-surface with no defects, such as scratches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example, a typical single-side polishing apparatus includes a turn, table <b>103</b> to which a polishing pad <b>102</b> is attached, a polishing-agent-supply mechanism <b>104</b>, a polishing head <b>101</b>. Such a polishing apparatus <b>110</b> holds a workpiece W with the polishing head <b>101</b>, supplies a polishing agent <b>105</b> from the polishing-agent-supply mechanism <b>104</b> onto the polishing pad <b>102</b>, rotates both the turn table <b>103</b> and the polishing head <b>101</b>, and polishes the workpiece W by bringing a front surface of the workpiece into sliding contact with the polishing pad <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One exemplary method of holding a workpiece with a polishing head is to attach the workpiece to a flat workpiece-holding board through an adhesive such as wax. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there is also a polishing head <b>121</b> of a waxless type that holds a workpiece W with a commercially available template assembly <b>113</b> adhering to a workpiece-holding board <b>112</b>. The template assembly has a template <b>113</b> <i>b</i>, for preventing the workpiece from coming off, attached to an elastic film <b>113</b> <i>a </i>called a backing film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Other exemplary polishing heads of a waxless type currently used include a polishing head <b>131</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, that includes a backing film <b>113</b> <i>a </i>attached to a surface of a workpiece-holding board <b>112</b>, instead of the commercially available template, and an annular guide ring <b>113</b> <i>b</i>, for preventing a workpiece from coming off, provided around the side surface of the workpiece-holding board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the workpiece holding board <b>112</b> is commonly composed of a highly-flat ceramic plate, this polishing head has a problem in that variation in thickness of the backing film <b>113</b> <i>a</i>, etc., produces a small pressure distribution, resulting in waviness of the polished front surface of the workpiece and hence there is a problem that deteriorates the flatness of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is also disclosed the so-called rubber chuck type of polishing head having a rubber film for holding a workpiece in place of the workpiece-holding board, in which the workpiece is pressed against a polishing pad by supplying pressurized fluid, such as air, to the back surface of the rubber film to inflate the rubber film with a uniform pressure (see Patent Document 1, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> schematically illustrates an example of a configuration of the rubber chuck type of polishing head. The essential parts of the polishing head <b>141</b> are an annular rigid ring <b>144</b> made of e.g., stainless steel, a rubber film <b>143</b> attached to the rigid ring <b>144</b>, and a back plate <b>145</b> connected to the rigid ring <b>144</b>. The rigid ring <b>144</b>, the rubber film <b>143</b>, and the back plate <b>145</b> define a sealed space <b>146</b>. On a lower surface portion of the rubber film <b>143</b>, a backing film <b>148</b> is attached, and an annular template <b>147</b> is provided concentrically with the rigid ring <b>144</b>. Pressurized fluid is supplied through the center of the back plate <b>145</b> with a pressure-adjusting mechanism <b>150</b> to adjust the pressure in the sealed space <b>146</b>. The back plate <b>145</b> is connected to a polishing head body <b>149</b> having a pressing means (not shown) for pressing the back plate <b>145</b> toward a polishing pad.</div>

<heading id="h-0008">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Use of such a rubber chuck type of polishing head prevents the small pressure distribution due to the variation in backing film thickness, and hence the waviness of tune polished front surface of the workpiece. Since the template has an inner diameter larger than an outer diameter of the workpiece, there is a small gap between the template and the workpiece. At this gap between the template and the workpiece, the rubber film inflates largely, when the pressurized fluid is supplied to the interior of the sealed space with the pressure adjusting mechanism to adjust the pressure as above. This inflation increases the pressure on an outer peripheral portion of the workpiece and lead to excessive polishing at this outer peripheral portion, and thereby an outer circumference sag tends to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Adjusting the thickness of the template allows the pressure on the outer peripheral portion of the workpiece to be adjusted to some extent, but variation in thickness of the template varies a polishing stock removal of the outer peripheral portion of the workpiece; consequently, the acquired flatness becomes unstable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In final polishing of a workpiece, the template is preferably kept from contacting a polishing pad for final polishing, because an extraneous substance, separated from the template when the template contacts the polishing pad, and the like creates a defect, such as a scratch, on the front surface of a workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">A polishing head including a template that has a thickness thinner than that of a workpiece and thereby avoids contact with a polishing pad, on the other hand, increases the pressure on the outer peripheral portion of the workpiece, thereby excessively polishing the outer peripheral portion to produce the outer circumference sag and hence to lower the flatness of the workpiece. Thus, this polishing head cannot be used for final polishing of a workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Patent Document 2 proposes another rubber-chuck type of polishing head in which water is enclosed in a fluid enclosing portion of a holding plate having an elastic film formed on its front surface, a volume adjusting screw that is capable of entering and coming out of the fluid enclosing portion is provided, the surface of the elastic film is made uniformly flat by the adjustment and brought into contact with the entire surface of a workpiece to press the workpiece. This method does not involve pressure adjustment by supplying pressurized fluid. For this reason, the inflation of a rubber film at a gap between a template and a workpiece can be inhibited, and the outer circumference sag is thereby suppressed. When there is firm adhesion between the workpiece and a polishing pad because of a flat shape of a workpiece holding surface, however, a problem arises in that the workpiece cannot be detached from the polishing pad after polishing the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, in the case of using a soft polishing pad in secondary polishing, the outer circumference sag occurs due to a polishing pad factor. It is accordingly necessary that the template and the workpiece have the same thickness and are simultaneously pressed against the polishing pad. In finish polishing, this configuration allows the template to contact the polishing pad, generating surface defects of the workpiece. Accordingly, another polishing head provided with a template thinner than the workpiece needs to be prepared, that is, secondary polishing and finish polishing cannot be performed with the same polishing head, resulting in a significant problem of workability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention was accomplished in view of the above-described problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a polishing head and a polishing apparatus that can uniformly polish a workpiece up to the outermost peripheral portion without generating surface defects, such as scratches, on the workpiece surface and readily detach the workpiece from a polishing pad after polishing.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">To achieve this object, the present invention provides a polishing head comprising: an annular rigid ring; an elastic film bonded to the rigid ring; and a mid-plate joined to the rigid ring so as to be movable upward and downward, the mid-plate defining a first sealed space together with the rigid ring and the elastic film, the polishing head being configured to hold a back surface of a workpiece on a lower surface of the elastic film and to polish a front surface of the workpiece by bringing the front surface into sliding contact with a polishing pad attached to a turn table, the polishing head further comprising an incompressible fluid enclosed in the first sealed space and a mid-plate positioning means for adjusting a vertical position of the mid-plate, wherein the mid-plate positioning means can adjust a shape of the lower surface of the elastic film by adjusting the vertical position of the mid-plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Such a polishing head can appropriately adjust the shape of the lower surface of the elastic film holding the workpiece by adjusting the vertical position of the mid-plate, thereby enabling the workpiece to be uniformly polished up to the outermost peripheral portion while inhibiting surface defects, such as scratches, of the workpiece surfaces. In addition, when the surface shape of the elastic film holding the workpiece is adjusted to be upward convex shape by moving the vertical position of the mid-plate upward, the workpiece can be reliably attached to the polishing head and readily detached from the polishing pad after polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventive polishing head preferably has a second sealed space defined by the mid-plate, a polishing head body disposed above the mid-plate, and an upper portion of the rigid ring contacting a lower end of the polishing head body, wherein the mid-plate positioning means adjusts the vertical position of the elastic film by controlling pressure in the second sealed space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Such a polishing head can adjust the vertical position of the mid-plate to be an optional position, enabling the shape of the lower surface of the mid-plate holding the workpiece to be readily adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The inventive polishing head may have a stopper for limiting an upper limit position and a lower limit position of the upward and downward movement of the mid-plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Such a polishing head can prevent elastic film shape variation exceeding a predetermined range and damage to the elastic film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The elastic film is preferably composed of a material having a tensile strength of 10 MPa or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Such a polishing head can reliably maintain the shape of the lower surface of the elastic film even when being subjected to polishing load applied to the workpiece and frictional resistance occurring between the polishing pad and the workpiece during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The inventive polishing head preferably has an annular template, for holding an edge portion of the workpiece, disposed concentrically with the rigid ring in a peripheral portion of the lower surface of the elastic film, or a resin ring, for holding the edge portion of the workpiece, disposed concentrically with and outside the rigid ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Such a polishing head can inhibit lateral movement of the workplace out of position during polishing. In addition, the workpiece can be uniformly polished up to the outermost peripheral portion by pressing the template or the resin ring against the polishing pad, even in secondary polishing using a soft polishing pad. This polishing head can also change whether the template or the resin ring presses the polishing pad or not by adjusting the vertical position of the mid-plate to change the position of the workplace front surface, and is thus suitable for both secondary polishing and finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The annular template preferably has a thickness adjusted within ±1% with respect to a finishing thickness of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Such a polishing head enables more reliable, uniform polishing of the workpiece up to the outermost peripheral portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, when the mid-plate is moved to the lower limit position, the shape of the lower surface of the elastic film is preferably adjusted to be a downward convex shape such that the front surface of the workpiece is located below a lower surface of the template or the resin ring, preferably by a distance ranging from 50 μm to 55% of the finishing thickness of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Such a configuration enables finish polishing in which the template or the resin ring does not press against the polishing pad, thereby reliably inhibiting surface defects. In addition, the vertical position of the mid-plate can readily be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the present invention provides a polishing apparatus for use in polishing of a front surface of a workpiece, comprising: a polishing pad attached to a turn table; a polishing-agent-supply mechanism for supplying a polishing agent onto the polishing pad; and the above inventive polishing head for holding the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Such a polishing apparatus can appropriately adjust the shape of the lower surface of the elastic film holding the workpiece by adjusting the position of the mid-plate, thereby enabling the workpiece to be uniformly polished up to the outermost peripheral portion while inhibiting surface defects, such as scratches, of the workpiece surfaces. In addition, when the surface shape of the elastic film holding the workpiece is made upward convex by moving the position of the mid-plate upward, the workpiece can be reliably attached to the polishing head and readily detached from the polishing pad after polishing.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The inventive polishing head has an incompressible fluid enclosed in a first sealed space and can adjust the shape of the lower surface of an elastic film by adjusting the vertical position of a mid-plate with a mid-plate positioning means, thereby uniformly polishing a workpiece up to the outermost peripheral portion while inhibiting occurrence of surface defects, such as scratches, of the workpiece surfaces. The polishing head also enables the workpiece to be readily detached from a polishing pad after polishing, thereby ensuring workpiece transportation.</div>

<heading id="h-0012">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Conventionally, a method of adjusting pressure on an outer peripheral portion of a workpiece with a template or the like is employed to suppress excessive polishing of the workpiece outer peripheral portion. There is however a problem in that variation in template thickness changes a polishing stock removal of the workpiece outer peripheral portion, resulting in unstable flatness. In the case of finish polishing, contact of the template or the like with a polishing pad causes a problem in that defects occurs on a workpiece surface due to an extraneous substance separated from the template, etc. In addition, if there is firm adhesion between the workpiece and the polishing pad, then the workpiece cannot be detached from the polishing pad after polishing in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, the present inventor diligently studied to solve such problems and consequently found that the configuration in which an incompressible fluid is enclosed in a sealed space defined by a rigid ring, an elastic film, and a mid-plate and the mid-plate is joined to the rigid ring so as to be movable upward and downward enables optimization of the lower surface shape of the elastic film by adjustment of the vertical position of the mid-plate, thereby enabling a workpiece that is flat up to the outermost, peripheral portion to be obtained by polishing. The present inventor also found that adjusting the lower surface of the elastic film to be an upward convex shape by moving the vertical position of the mid-plate upward allows the workpiece to be readily detached from the polishing pad after polishing, thereby bringing the present invention to completion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The first embodiment of the inventive polishing head will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>a </i>has an elastic film <b>3</b>, an annular rigid ring <b>4</b>, a mid-plate <b>5</b>, a mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b>, and a polishing head body <b>9</b>. The elastic film <b>3</b> is bonded on the lower surface side of the rigid ring <b>4</b> with uniform tension. The mid-plate <b>5</b> is joined to the rigid ring <b>4</b> so as to be movable upward and downward. The vertical, position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> is adjusted by the mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b>. A first sealed space <b>6</b> is defined by the elastic film <b>3</b>, the rigid ring <b>4</b>, and the mid-plate <b>5</b>. The back surface of a workpiece W is held on the lower surface of the elastic film <b>3</b>, and the front surface of the workpiece W is polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In such a rubber chuck portion, having the elastic film <b>3</b>, the rigid ring <b>4</b>, the mid-plate <b>5</b>, and the like, an incompressible fluid <b>2</b> is previously enclosed in the first sealed space <b>6</b> before polishing of the workpiece W. As used herein, the term “incompressible fluid” refers to fluid in which its volume is not greatly reduced due to compression when pressure is applied, unlike air. For example, water, an incompressible fluid mainly composed of water, or oil may be used as the incompressible fluid <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Use of water or an incompressible fluid mainly composed of water is more preferable because it reduces cost and eliminates a risk of contamination of a workpiece and the interior of a polishing apparatus even though the incompressible fluid <b>2</b> leaks from the first sealed space <b>6</b>, for example, as the elastic film <b>3</b> is torn during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, a polishing agent for use in polishing of the workpiece W, or aqueous solution containing at least one or more components among components of the polishing agent is preferably used to prevent polishing quality of the workpiece W from being affected even through the incompressible fluid <b>2</b> leaks from the first sealed space <b>6</b>. For a workpiece W made of a semiconductor material, pure water, which does not include metal ions and the like, is preferably used as the incompressible fluid <b>2</b> to prevent metal contamination, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The material of the rigid ring <b>4</b> may be a rigid material, such as stainless steel (SUS). The material and the shape of the mid-plate <b>5</b> are not limited in particular, provided the mid-plate <b>5</b> can define the first sealed space <b>6</b> together with the rigid ring <b>4</b>, and the rubber film <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">To join the mid-plate <b>5</b> movably upward and downward to the rigid ring <b>4</b>, for example, the mid-plate <b>5</b> and the rigid ring <b>4</b> may be joined through a diaphragm, or the mid-plate <b>5</b> and the mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b> may be connected with a boll screw or air cylinder. The present invention is however not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The adjustment of the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> enables the lower surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> to be adjusted so as to be, for example, an upward convex shape, a downward convex shape, or a flat shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The polishing head body <b>9</b> has a pressing unit (not shown) and can apply a pressing load (a pressing force) to the workpiece W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The material of the elastic film <b>3</b> is preferably composed of, but not limited to, a material having a tensile strength (Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) K6251) of 10 MPa or more, more preferably 20 MPa or more. Such an elastic film can reliably maintain its lower surface shape even when being subjected to a polishing load applied to a workpiece or a frictional resistance occurring between the polishing pad and the workpiece during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">With the inventive polishing head <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the adjustment of the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> by the mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b> enables the optimization of the lower surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> holding a workpiece W according to polishing conditions. In addition, since the volume of the incompressible fluid <b>2</b> enclosed in the first sealed space <b>6</b> hardly changes during polishing, the optimum shape of the lower surface of the elastic film can be maintained and a uniform load can be applied to the entire workpiece W to polish the workpiece W. The workpiece can thereby be uniformly polished up to its outermost peripheral portion, and no surface defects due to separation of an extraneous substance, etc., occur on the workpiece surfaces. In addition, the upward convex surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b>, which is formed by moving the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> upward, allows the workpiece both to be reliably attached to the polishing head and to be readily detached from the polishing pad after polishing, resulting in reliable transportation of workpieces.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mid-plate <b>5</b> of the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>b </i>is joined to the rigid ring <b>4</b> though a diaphragm <b>10</b> such that the mid-plate is movable upward and downward. A second sealed space <b>11</b> is defined by the mid-plate <b>5</b>, the polishing head body <b>9</b> disposed above the mid-plate <b>5</b>, an upper portion of the rigid ring <b>4</b> that contacts the lower end of the polishing head body <b>9</b>. The configuration of the mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b> employs a pressure controlling apparatus <b>12</b> connecting with the second sealed space <b>11</b>. The pressure controlling apparatus <b>12</b> is configured to be capable of reducing and applying pressure to adjust the pressure in the second sealed space <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b> can thus adjust the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> by controlling the pressure in the second sealed space <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The inventive polishing head <b>1</b> <i>b </i>thus configured can adjustably change the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> to an optional position, enabling the lower surface shape of the elastic film holding a workpiece to be readily optimized.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>c </i>is provided with an upper limit stopper <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and a lower limit stopper <b>13</b> <i>b </i>to limit the upper limit position and the lower limit position of the vertical movement of the mid-plate <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The inventive polishing head <b>1</b> <i>c </i>thus configured can inhibit variation in shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> beyond a predetermined range and prevent damage to elastic film <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of the forth embodiment of the inventive polishing head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>d </i>is provided with an annular template <b>7</b> and a backing film <b>14</b> in addition to the configuration of the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The annular template <b>7</b> is disposed concentrically with the rigid ring <b>4</b> in a peripheral portion of the lower surface of the elastic film <b>3</b> and holds an edge portion of the workpiece W. For the purpose of avoiding contamination, scratches, and indentations of a workpiece W, the template <b>7</b> is preferably composed of a high abrasion resistant material that is hard to wear by sliding contact with a polishing pad of a polishing apparatus during polishing, and softer than a workpiece W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The backing film <b>14</b> is disposed such that the backing film adheres to at least a portion at which the workpiece W is held of the lower surface of the elastic film <b>3</b>. After water is included in the backing film <b>14</b>, the workpiece W is attached to the backing film <b>14</b>, through which the workpiece W is held on a workpiece holding surface of the elastic film <b>3</b>. The workpiece W can reliably be held by surface tension of the water contained in the backing film <b>14</b>. The backing film <b>14</b> may be composed of, for example, polyurethane. A commercially available template-assembly having a template attached to the surface of a backing film may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The above polishing head having the annular template <b>7</b> and the backing film <b>14</b> can prevent the workpiece W from slipping out of position during polishing, enabling the workpiece to be more stably held.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The template <b>7</b> may be configured such that the template has the same thickness as the workpiece W and can press against a polishing pad together with the workpiece W during polishing. Even in secondary polishing using a soft polishing pad, which is easy to cause an outer circumference sag due to particularly a polishing pad factor, such a template enables the workpiece W to be more uniformly polished up to the outermost peripheral portion, thereby effectively inhibiting the outer circumference sag of the workpiece W. In this case, thickness precision of the template <b>7</b> is preferably adjusted within ±1% of a finishing thickness of a workpiece because the workpiece can be more reliably uniformly polished up to the outermost peripheral portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, since the inventive polishing head can adjust the shape of the lower surface of the elastic film <b>3</b> by adjusting the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> with the mid-plate positioning means <b>8</b>, the vertical position of the front surface of a workpiece W can also be adjusted by the variation in the lower surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b>. If the lower surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> is adjusted to be a downward convex shape, for example, then the vertical position of the front surface of the workpiece W can be adjusted to be below the position of the workpiece when the lower surface shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> is flat. In other word, adjusting the vertical position of the mid-plate <b>5</b> enables adjustment of a vertical relative distance between the workpiece front surface and the template lower end surface, thereby changing whether or not the template presses the polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, even when the template and the workpiece have the same thickness, polishing, particularly finish polishing, can be performed without contact of the template with the polishing pad, and the workpiece W can thereby be uniformly polished up to its outermost peripheral portion while occurrence of surface defects on the workpiece is inhibited. The inventive polishing head can thus be used suitably for both second polishing and finish polishing.</div>

The polishing head <b>1</b> <i>e </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> holds the edge portion of the workpiece W with a resin ring <b>15</b> that is disposed concentrically with and outside the rigid ring <b>4</b>, whereas the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>d </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> holds the edge portion of the workpiece W with the annular template <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The above polishing head having the resin ring <b>15</b> and the backing film <b>14</b> can prevent the workpiece W from slipping out of position during polishing, enabling the workpiece to be more stably held.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The height of the resin ring <b>15</b> may be adjusted such that the vertical position of the workpiece front surface is substantially identical to that of the lower end surface of the resin ring <b>15</b> when the workpiece W is held with the shape of the elastic film <b>3</b> being flat. As in the above description of the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>d</i>, the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>e </i>thus configured can simultaneously press the resin ring <b>15</b> and the workpiece W against the polishing pad during polishing to more uniformly polish the workpiece up to the outermost peripheral portion of the workpiece.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram of an example of the inventive polishing apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">As described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the inventive polishing apparatus <b>30</b> has a polishing pad <b>32</b> attached to a turn table <b>33</b>, a polishing-agent-supply mechanism <b>34</b> for supplying a polishing agent <b>35</b> onto the polishing pad <b>32</b>, and the above-described polishing head <b>1</b> <i>d </i>for holding a workpiece W.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The polishing apparatus <b>30</b> thus configured can appropriately adjust the lower surface shape of an elastic film holding a workpiece by adjusting the position of a mid-plate, thereby uniformly polishing the workpiece up to the outermost peripheral portion while inhibiting the occurrence of surface defects, such as scratches, on the workpiece surfaces. In addition, the polishing apparatus can reliably attach the workpiece to the polishing head by moving the position of the mid-plate upward to change the surface shape of the elastic film holding the workpiece into an upward convex shape, and readily detach the workpiece from the polishing pad after polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In secondary polishing with the polishing apparatus <b>30</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the pressure in the second sealed space <b>11</b> located above the mid-plate <b>5</b> is adjusted such that the workpiece holding surface of the elastic film <b>3</b> becomes flat, the mid-plate is fixed at an appropriate position, and polishing is then performed.

<heading id="h-0013">EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention will be more specifically described below with reference to examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is not limited to these examples.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">With the inventive polishing apparatus <b>30</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a workpiece was polished. With the fluid enclosing apparatus <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the polishing head <b>1</b> <i>d </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> was prepared as follows. A stainless steel rigid ring having an outer diameter of 360 mm and an inner diameter of 320 mm was used. An EPDM rubber having a tensile strength of 18 MPa, as the elastic film, was bonded to the lower surface of the rigid ring. On the lower surface of the elastic film was attached a commercially available template assembly including a template with an outer diameter of 355 mm, an inner diameter of 302 mm, and a thickness of 730 μm adhering to a surface of a backing film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">A silicon single crystal wafer having a diameter of 300 mm and a thickness of 775 μm was used as the workpiece. The thickness of the spacer for adjustment was 250 μm. Pure water was used as an incompressible fluid and enclosed in the first sealed space with a pressure of 70 KPa. The polishing head was mounted on the polishing apparatus, and secondary polishing followed by finish polishing of the workpiece was then performed. The turn table used had a diameter of 800 mm. A velour type of polishing pad obtained by impregnating nonwoven fabric with urethane was used as a polishing pad for use in secondary polishing; a suede type of polishing pad obtained by forming urethane foam on nonwoven fabric was used as a polishing pad for use in finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The silicon single crystal wafer used as the workpiece was previously subjected to primary double-side polishing and edge polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In the secondary polishing, alkali solution containing colloidal silica was used as a polishing agent. The polishing head and the turn table were rotated at 31 rpm and 29 rpm, respectively. The polishing load (pressing force) on the workpiece was set to 15 KPa in terms of contact pressure on the workpiece by a pressing means, not shown. The pressure in the second sealed space was controlled to be 10 KPa with the pressure controlling apparatus such that the workpiece was subjected to the same pressure as the template. The polishing time was adjusted such that the average polishing amount of the workpiece became 1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Successively, after the secondary polishing, finish polishing of the workpiece was performed with the same polishing head. In the finish polishing, alkali solution containing colloidal silica and minute amounts of water-soluble polymer additives as a wetting agent was used as a polishing agent. The polishing head and the turn table were rotated at 31 rpm and 29 rpm, respectively. The polishing load on the workpiece was set to 15 KPa in terms of contact pressure on the workpiece by a pressing means, not shown. The pressure in the second sealed space was set to a higher pressure with the pressure controlling apparatus such that the mid-plate abutted the lower limit stopper and polishing was performed for 120 seconds with the pressure controlled to be 50 KPa. After the finish polishing, the workpiece was cleaned with ammonia-hydrogen peroxide solution, i.e., SC1 solution, heated to 70° C. to remove the polishing agent from the workpiece surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The workpiece was readily detached from the polishing pad by moving the mid-plate upward after the finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Variation in polishing stock removal in a plane of the workpiece thus polished was evaluated. The polishing stock removal was calculated in such a manner that the thickness of the workpiece was measured in the range except for a width of 1 mm from the outermost periphery, as a flatness guarantee area, with a flatness measuring instrument before and after polishing, and the differences in the thickness before and after polishing in cross section in a workpiece diameter direction were obtained. Wafer Sight (manufactured by KLA-Tencor) was used as the flatness measuring instrument.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition, surface defects on the polished workpiece was evaluated. In the evaluation of the surface defects, the number of defects having a size of 37 nm or more on the workpiece surface was measured with SP-2 manufactured by KLA-Tencor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show polishing stock removal distribution of the workpiece polished in Example 1. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the whole polishing stock removal distribution; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows an enlarged view in the positional range on the workpiece from 120 mm to 150 mm. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, substantially uniform polishing was performed inside a position of 3 mm inward away from the outer periphery; although the polishing stock removal slightly increased in the range from 1 mm to 3 mm inward away from the outer periphery, variation in polishing stock removal was 39.6 nm, which was greatly improved compared with the later-described Comparative Example 2 in which the same elastic film and the same template were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows a surface-defects map of the workpiece polished in Example 1. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the number of defects having a size of 37 nm or more on the workpiece surface was 18, which was also greatly improved compared with Comparative Example 2 in which a template having the same thickness as the workpiece was used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">It was thus confirmed that performing secondary and finish polishing with the inventive polishing head and polishing apparatus enables uniform polishing up to the outermost peripheral portion of a workpiece without occurrence of surface defects, such as scratches, on surfaces of the workpiece and easy detachment of the workpiece from a polishing pad after polishing the workpiece.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">Examples 2 to 5</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Secondary polishing and finish polishing of a workpiece were performed under the same conditions as Example 1 with a silicone rubber having a tensile strength of 8 MPa and a thickness of 2 mm (Example 2), an EPDM rubber having a tensile strength of 12 MPa and a thickness of 2 mm (Example 3), an NBR rubber having a tensile strength of 21 MPa and a thickness of 2 mm (Example 4), or an hydrogen-added. NBR rubber having a tensile strength of 37 MPa and a thickness of 2 mm (Example 5) as the elastic film of the polishing head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the polishing stock removal distribution of the workpieces subjected to the secondary and finish polishing in Examples 2 to 5 in which elastic films each having different tensile strengths were used. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it was understood that use of an elastic film having a higher tensile strength suppresses increase in polishing stock removal at the outermost peripheral portion, thereby enabling flatter polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the relationship between the tensile strength of the used elastic film and variation in polishing stock removal. The variations in polishing stock removal of the workpieces polished in Examples 2 to 5 were 53.4 nm, 49.7 nm, 27.3 nm, and 13.6 nm. The higher the tensile strength of the elastic film was, the less the variation in polishing stock removal of the workpiece was.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">From these results, use of an elastic film composed of a material having a tensile strength of 10 MPa or more is preferable to suppress the variation in polishing stock removal of the workpiece to 50 nm or below. Moreover, use of an elastic film composed of a material having a tensile strength of 20 MPa or more is preferable to suppress the variation in polishing stock removal to 30 nm or below. Use of an elastic film having a high tensile strength thus enables the outer peripheral portion of a workpiece to be more uniformly polished.</div>

In Comparative Example 1, increase in polishing stock removal was seen in the vicinity of a position of 25 mm inward away from the outer periphery, and rapid increase in polishing stock removal was seen in the range from 1 mm to 3 mm inward away from the outer periphery. The variation in polishing stock removal was 116.2 nm. In Comparative Example 2 in which the template had a thickness of 780 μm, which was close to the thickness of the workpiece, although the increase in polishing stock removal in the range from the outer periphery to 25 mm inward was improved and uniform polishing was performed inside a position of 3 mm inward away from the outer periphery, the rapid increase in polishing stock removal in the range from 1 mm to 3 mm inward away from the outer periphery was not improved. The variation in polishing stock removal was 81.2 nm.</div>

In Comparative Example 1 in which the template thickness was 750 μm, the number of defects was 216; in Comparative Example 2 in which the template thickness was 730 μm, the number of defects was 684. In Comparative Example 2, since the template thickness was thicker, and the template continued to contact a polishing pad for finish polishing, the number of defects increased compared with Comparative Example 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As described above, the combination of the secondary and finish polishing using the same polishing head in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 failed to effect the combination of polishing with uniform polishing stock removal and inhibition of occurrence of defects.</div>
