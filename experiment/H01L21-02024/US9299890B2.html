<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a group III nitride semiconductor substrate, an epitaxial substrate and a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, semiconductors, including compound semiconductors, have been used in an increasingly wider range of application fields by taking advantage of various characteristic features of the semiconductors. For example, a compound semiconductor is useful as a base substrate for epitaxial layers to be laminated on, thus, the compound semiconductor is used in semiconductor devices such as a light-emitting diode and a laser diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">If a semiconductor substrate is used as the base substrate, a surface of the semiconductor substrate needs to be processed into a strain-free mirror surface. Accordingly, preprocessing (for example, cutting, lapping and etching) is performed on a single-crystal semiconductor ingot to obtain a semiconductor substrate, and then mirror-polishing is performed on a surface of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As semiconductor substrates, there are known, for example, those described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3 below. Patent Literature 1 discloses a semiconductor substrate obtained by cutting a crystalline III-V nitride (for example, (Al, Ga, In)—N) crystal-grown by means of vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE) and then performing preprocessing. Patent Literature 1 discloses performing chemical polishing (CMP) after mechanically polishing a surface of the semiconductor substrate, as a preprocessing, in order to remove superficial damage caused by the mechanical polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 2 discloses a semiconductor substrate in which a surface of an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (0&lt;y≦1, x+y+z=1) wafer is polished by CMP to reduce RMS-based surface roughness to less than 0.15 nm, thereby reducing surface defect and contamination. Patent Literature 2 discloses using Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or SiO<sub>2 </sub>as abrasive grains at the time of performing CMP and adjusting pH by adding an oxidizing agent to a polishing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 3 discloses a semiconductor substrate in which an Si concentration at a boundary face between an epitaxial layer and the semiconductor substrate is set to 8×10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or lower, on the assumption that Si piled up (accumulated) on the boundary face between the epitaxial layer and the semiconductor substrate deteriorates device characteristics.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">However, a light-emitting diode using a laminated body formed by disposing an epitaxial layer (well layer) on a semiconductor substrate described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3 cited above has limitations in improving emission intensity and yield. Accordingly, there has been a strong desire for the development of a semiconductor substrate capable of highly balancing the emission intensity and yield of a light-emitting diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has been accomplished in order to solve the above-described problem, an object of the present invention is to provide a group III nitride semiconductor substrate capable of highly balancing the emission intensity and yield of a semiconductor device, as well as to provide an epitaxial substrate and a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The present inventors have found, as a result of extensive research, that if an impurity, such as C (carbon), is present on a surface of a semiconductor substrate, the C piles up on a boundary face when the epitaxial layer is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate, and therefore, a layer high in electrical resistance (hereinafter referred to as “high-resistivity layer”) is formed on the epitaxial layer/semiconductor substrate boundary face. The present inventors have also found that the electrical resistance of the epitaxial layer/semiconductor substrate boundary face increases as the result of the high-resistivity layer being formed, and therefore, the emission intensity and yield decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the present inventors have found that by the presence of specific amounts of sulfide and oxide on a substrate surface in a group III nitride semiconductor substrate used for a semiconductor device, it is possible to prevent C from piling up on a boundary face between an epitaxial layer and the semiconductor substrate. By thus preventing C from piling up, a high-resistivity layer is prevented from being formed on the boundary face between the epitaxial layer and the semiconductor substrate. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce electrical resistance at the boundary face between the epitaxial layer and the semiconductor substrate, and improve the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer. Consequently, it is possible to improve the emission intensity and yield of the light-emitting diode.</div>

<heading id="h-0011">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of a group III nitride semiconductor substrate, an epitaxial substrate and a semiconductor device according to the present invention will be described in detail while referring to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">(Group III Nitride Semiconductor Substrate)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a group III nitride semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the group III nitride semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (hereinafter referred to as “nitride substrate <b>10</b>”) comprises a front surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and a rear surface <b>10</b> <i>b </i>opposed to each other, and a surface layer <b>12</b> is formed on the front surface <b>10</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The constituent material of the nitride substrate <b>10</b> is preferably a crystal having a wurtzite structure, examples of the constituent material include GaN, AlN, InN, AlGaN and InGaN. A nitride substrate <b>10</b> made of GaN can be fabricated by, for example, an HVPE method or a flux method. A nitride substrate <b>10</b> made of MN can be fabricated by, for example, an HYPE method or a sublimation method. A nitride substrate <b>10</b> made of InN, AlGaN or InGaN can be fabricated by, for example, an HVPE method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The nitride substrate <b>10</b> allows for the epitaxial growth of a desired semiconductor layer (epitaxial layer) on the front surface <b>10</b> <i>a</i>. The quality of the front surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>is preferably suited for the formation of an epitaxial layer. Unlike the crystal quality of a bulk portion within the substrate, the quality of the front surface <b>10</b> <i>a </i>is susceptible to effects caused by a surface composition, surface roughness, and an affected layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, the affected layer refers to a layer with crystal lattice disorder, formed in the surface-side region of a crystal due to the grinding or polishing thereof. The presence and the thickness of the affected layer can be confirmed by making an SEM, TEM or CL (cathode luminescence) observation on a cross section of a crystal broken at the cleavage surface thereof. The thickness of the affected layer is preferably 20 nm or smaller, and more preferably 10 nm or smaller. If the affected layer is too thick, the morphology and crystallinity of the epitaxial layer tend to degrade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The CL observation refers to observing visible light or light close in wavelength to a visible wavelength range emitted from the group III nitride semiconductor crystal by making electron beams incident on a group III nitride semiconductor crystal as exciting light. In the CL observation of the group III nitride semiconductor crystal, light is observed in a crystalline region excellent in surface condition, light is not observed in a region of an affected layer having crystal disorder, and the region is observed as a black linear shade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">When the nitride substrate <b>10</b> is used in a semiconductor device, it is preferable to prevent a high-resistivity layer from being formed at a boundary face between the nitride substrate <b>10</b> and the epitaxial layer. If the electrical resistance of the boundary face increases due to the presence of the high-resistivity layer, the luminous efficiency of the semiconductor device degrades. In particular, the luminous efficiency degrades remarkably if a large electric current is injected into the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">From the viewpoint of preventing the formation of such a high-resistivity layer, the surface layer <b>12</b> contains a sulfide and an oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The surface layer <b>12</b> contains 30×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>of sulfide in terms of S and 2 at % to 20 at % of oxide in terms of O. The content of sulfide is preferably 40×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1500×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, and more preferably 100×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 500×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, in terms of S. The content of oxide is preferably 3 at % to 16 at %, and more preferably 4 at % to 12 at %, in terms of O. If the content of sulfide is less than 30×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>or the content of oxide is less than 2 at %, a high-resistivity layer is formed at the boundary face between the semiconductor substrate and the epitaxial layer, and therefore, the yield of the semiconductor device degrades due to a resistance increase in the boundary face. If the content of sulfide exceeds 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>or the content of oxide exceeds 20 at %, the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer degrades, and therefore, the intensity (PL intensity) of light emitted by a PL (photoluminescence) method of the epitaxial layer degrades.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The surface layer <b>12</b> preferably contains 120×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 15000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>of chloride in terms of Cl.

If the content of chloride is less than 120×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, a high-resistivity layer is liable to form at the boundary face between the semiconductor substrate and the epitaxial layer, and therefore, the yield of the semiconductor device tends to degrade due to a resistance increase in the boundary face. If the content of chloride exceeds 15000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer is liable to degrade, and therefore, the PL intensity of the epitaxial layer tends to degrade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The surface layer <b>12</b> preferably contains 100×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 12000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>of silicon compound in terms of Si. The content of silicon compound is more preferably 500×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 8000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, and even more preferably 1000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 5000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, in terms of Si. If the content of silicon compound is less than 100×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, a high-resistivity layer is liable to form at the boundary face between the semiconductor substrate and the epitaxial layer, and therefore, the yield of the semiconductor device tends to degrade due to a resistance increase in the boundary face. If the content of silicon compound exceeds 12000×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer is liable to degrade, and therefore, the PL intensity of the epitaxial layer tends to degrade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The surface layer <b>12</b> may contain a carbon compound. The content of carbon compound in the surface layer <b>12</b> is preferably 22 at % or less, more preferably 18 at % or less, and even more preferably 15 at % or less, in terms of C. If the content of carbon compound exceeds 22 at %, the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer is liable to degrade, and therefore, the PL intensity of the epitaxial layer tends to degrade, while a high-resistivity layer is liable to form at the boundary face between the semiconductor substrate and the epitaxial layer, and therefore, the yield of the semiconductor device tends to degrade due to a resistance increase in the boundary face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The surface layer <b>12</b> may contain a copper compound. The content of copper compound in the surface layer <b>12</b> is preferably 150×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less, more preferably 100×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less, and even more preferably 50×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less, in terms of Cu. If the content of copper compound exceeds 150×10<sup>10 </sup>pieces/cm<sup>2</sup>, the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer is liable to degrade, and therefore, the PL intensity of the epitaxial layer tends to degrade, while a high-resistivity layer is liable to form at the boundary face between the semiconductor substrate and the epitaxial layer, and therefore, the yield of the semiconductor device tends to degrade due to a resistance increase in the boundary face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The composition of the surface layer <b>12</b> can be quantified for S, Si, Cl and Cu by means of TXRF (total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis). On the basis of an X-ray penetration depth, TXRF evaluates a composition ranging from a surface to a depth of approximately 5 nm. For O and C, the quantities thereof can be determined by means of AES (Auger electron spectroscopy analysis). AES has a resolution of 0.1%. On the basis of the escape depth of Auger electrons, AES evaluates a composition ranging from a surface to a depth of approximately 5 nm. Note that the surface layer <b>12</b> is a layer having a thickness of, for example, approximately 5 nm which allows ingredients contained in the surface layer to be measured by TXRF or AES.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">A difference in composition between the surface layer <b>12</b> and a bulk portion within the nitride substrate <b>10</b> can be evaluated by conducting analysis in a depth direction using SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy). Differences in composition among the interior of the nitride substrate <b>10</b>, the boundary face between the nitride substrate <b>10</b> and the epitaxial layer, and the interior of the epitaxial layer can also be evaluated by SIMS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The surface roughness of the surface layer <b>12</b> in the nitride substrate <b>10</b> is preferably 5 nm or less, more preferably 3 nm or less, and even more preferably 1 nm or less, on an RMS basis, from the viewpoint of being able to further improve the crystal quality of the epitaxial layer and the integral intensity of light emission by an element.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">(1) Fabrication of GaN Substrate</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">First, an n-type GaN crystal (dopant: O) was grown in a c-axis direction by an HYPE method. Next, the GaN crystal was sliced vertically to a c-axis, thereby obtaining 50 mm (diameter)×0.5 mm (thickness) GaN substrates with the surface plane (0001).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Subsequently, dry etching was performed on a front surface of each GaN substrate and on a rear surface opposite to the front surface to remove affected layers. For the dry etching, an RIE apparatus having the same configuration as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was used. The volume (V) of a vacuum chamber was 20 L. The material of a substrate support base was SiC. Cl<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4 </sub>were used as etching gases, and a gas flow rate (Q) was 30 sccm. The dry etching was performed at a pressure (P) of 4.0 Pa and a power of 50 W to 200 W (PV/Q=2.67).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">(2) Lapping of GaN Substrate Surface</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The rear surface ((000-1) surface) of each GaN substrate was bonded to a ceramic crystal holder with wax. A surface plate 380 mm in diameter was mounted on a lapping apparatus, and then, the surface plate was rotated around the rotational axis thereof, while feeding slurry including diamond abrasive grains dispersed from a slurry supply port to the surface plate. Next, a surface of n-type GaN crystal was lapped by rotating the GaN substrate around the rotational axis of the crystal holder, while pressing the GaN substrate against the surface plate by placing a weight on the crystal holder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Lapping was performed under the following conditions. As the surface plate, a copper surface plate and a tin surface plate were used. Three types of diamond abrasive grains having grain diameters of 9 μm, 3 μm and 2 μm were prepared as the abrasive grains, and then, in the course of lapping, abrasive grains smaller in grain diameter were used in a stepwise manner. Polishing pressure was 100 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 500 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the rotational frequency of both the GaN substrate and the surface plate was 30 revolutions/min to 60 revolutions/min. As the result of lapping described above, it was confirmed that a surface of the GaN crystal substrate turned into a mirror surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">(3) CMP of GaN Substrate Surface</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Using a polishing apparatus having the same configuration as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, CMP was performed on a surface of each GaN substrate. CMP was performed under the following conditions. As a polishing pad, a polyurethane suede pad (Supreme RN-R made by Nitta Haas Inc.) was used. As a surface plate, a circular stainless-steel surface plate 380 mm in diameter was used. A contact coefficient C between the GaN substrate and the polishing pad was 1.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>m to 2.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>m. Polishing pressure was 10 kPa to 80 kPa, and the rotational frequency of both the GaN substrate and the polishing pad was 30 revolutions/min to 120 revolutions/min. For slurry (CMP solution), 20 mass % of silica grains 200 nm in grain diameter was dispersed in water as abrasive grains. Citric acid and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>were added to the slurry as pH adjusters, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate was added to the slurry as an oxidizing agent, in order to adjust the pH and the oxidation-reduction potential of the slurry to a range given by Expression (3) shown below (x: pH, y: oxidation-reduction potential (mV)).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">GaN substrates different in surface composition were fabricated by changing the conditions of dry etching and CMP as appropriate. The sulfide, silicon compound, chloride and copper compound contents of a surface of each GaN substrate were evaluated by TXRF, and the oxide and carbon compound contents of the surface were evaluated by AES. For TXRF, a W-sealed X-ray tube was used as a source of X rays, and measurements were made at an X-ray output voltage of 40 kV, an X-ray output current of 40 mA, and an incident angle of 0.05°. For AES, measurements were made at an acceleration voltage of 10 keV. The RMS-based surface roughness of the surface of each GaN substrate was evaluated by AFM observation of the GaN substrate surfaces within the range of 10 μm×10 μM. The dislocation densities were evaluated by cathodoluminescence. Tables 1 to 7 show the surface compositions, surface roughnesses, and dislocation densities of the GaN substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">(4) Fabrication of Semiconductor Device Including GaN Substrate</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">A GaN substrate was placed inside an MOCVD apparatus, and a 1 μm-thick n-type GaN layer (dopant: Si), a 150 nm-thick n-type Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer (dopant: Si), an active layer, a 20 nm-thick p-type Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer (dopant: Mg) and a 150 nm-thick p-type GaN layer (dopant: Mg) were formed in sequence on the front surface side of the GaN substrate by a MOCVD method, to obtain an epitaxial layer formed on the GaN substrate. Here, the active layer included a four-layered barrier layer and a three-layered well layer, and had a multiquantum well structure in which the barrier layers and well layers were alternately laminated. Each barrier layer was a 10 nm-thick GaN layer, and each well layer was a 3 nm-thick Ga<sub>0.85</sub>In<sub>0.15</sub>N layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">The epitaxial layer thus formed was evaluated with regard to the PL intensity. As the evaluation of the PL intensity, using an He—Cd laser having a wavelength of 325 nm as an exciting light source, the intensity of a wavelength of 460 nm was evaluated. Tables 1 to 7 show the measurement results of the PL intensities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, a laminated body including a 200 nm-thick Ti layer, a 1000 nm-thick Al layer, a 200 nm-thick Ti layer, and a 2000 nm-thick Au layer, was formed on the rear surface ((000-1) surface) side of the GaN substrates. An n-side electrode (a first electrode) with a diameter of 100 μm was formed by heating the laminated body in a nitrogen atmosphere. In addition, a laminated body including a 4 nm-thick Ni layer and a 4 nm-thick Au layer was formed on a p-type GaN layer. A p-side electrode (a second electrode) was formed by heating the laminated body in a nitrogen atmosphere. The laminated product obtained by the above-mentioned steps was processed into 2 mm-squares. In addition, the p-side electrode was bonded to a conductor with a solder layer formed with AuSn, and the n-side electrode and the conductor were bonded with a wire, and thus, LEDs were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The LED light output (PL intensity) was measured using an integrating sphere on the condition of injection current of 4 A. A predetermined electric current was injected into the LED mounted inside the integrating sphere, and the light condensed from the LED was measured by a detector as the LED light output. In addition, the LED having the light output of 2 W or more was regarded as a semiconductor device which well fabricated, each yield regarding 200 LEDs was calculated. Tables 1 to 7 show the element yields of the LEDs.</div>
