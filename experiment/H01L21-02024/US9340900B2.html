<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an epitaxial wafer and a method of producing the same. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-240962, filed Sep. 6, 2006, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-228716, filed on Sep. 4, 2007, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a trend to miniaturize substrates of semiconductor devices produced using silicon wafers, for example, so as to reduce the production cost of semiconductor devices. In accordance with this trend, there is an increasing demand for improving surface roughness and surface flatness of semiconductor wafers. In addition, with regard to light point defects (LPDs) on a semiconductor wafer, reduction of size and numbers of the LPDs are further required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In many cases, conventionally used silicon substrates are produced using epitaxial wafers obtained from (100) crystal (hereafter, (100) crystal denotes a crystal for obtaining {100} wafers: wafers having a main surface constituted of (100) plane). Recently, substrates produced using epitaxial wafers obtained from (110) crystal (hereafter, (110) crystal denotes a crystal for obtaining {110} wafers: wafers having a main surfaces constituted of (110) plane) are recognized as substrates of next generation which are appropriately applicable for MOS structure devices such as MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), MPUs (Micro-Processing Units), and Logic Arrays (e.g., Patent Reference 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-253797). Especially for double face polished {100} substrates having a diameter of not less than 8 inches, reduction of the production costs in consistent with improvement of device property is considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">An epitaxial wafer made of a (100) crystal has an excellent flatness (surface roughness) which may be reflected on detection limit (minimum size to be detected) of LPD size (size of light point defect) of 100 nm or less. On the other hand, an epitaxial wafer made of a (110) crystal has a large surface roughness compared to the epitaxial wafer made of a (100) crystal. Therefore, the detection limit of the LPD size is increased and small sized LPDs cannot be detected. Where numerous LPDs exist on the main surface of the wafer, the LPDs cause a problem of failure leak current in a device production process. It is considered that inferior surface roughness and larger detection limit of LPDs of the epitaxial wafer made of a (110) crystal compared to the epitaxial wafer made of an (100) crystal are caused by difference of physical properties such as atomic arrangement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As a method for improving the surface roughness of a wafer to a level nearly the same as the substrate, there is a known method, for example as described in Patent Reference 2 (Japanese Examined Patent Application, Second Publication H8-17163), where after epitaxial growth of an epitaxial layer on a wafer, the main surface of the wafer is mirror polished so as to remove defects such as crowns generated by the epitaxial growth, thereby preventing the generation of dusts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-described method is not sufficient for a case where an LPD size of 100 nm or less is required for a product quality. In the above-described method, there is a possibility that a state of LPDs after the polishing and qualities of surface roughness and surface flatness are changed depending on the surface state after the epitaxial growth. Especially, in the case of a (110) wafer, because of its large surface roughness after the epitaxial growth compared to the (100) wafer, surface roughness and flatness cannot be improved sufficiently by mirror polishing after the growth of the epitaxial layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">When LPDs existing on the main surface of a wafer are measured using a laser light, degree of flatness has a large influence on the detection noise in the measurement of LPDs. Specifically, detection noise in the time of detecting LPDs increases with decreasing quality of surface roughness. Therefore, in the currently used conventional epitaxial wafer made of an (110) crystal, because of inferior surface roughness of the wafer, LPDs smaller than 100 nm in size cannot be detected by the measurement. In such surface conditions, it is difficult to correctly detect LPDs existing on the main surface of next generation type epitaxial wafers made of (110) crystal to which an LPD size of 100 mm or less is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Where the polishing after the epitaxial growth is performed to achieve large removal amount, it is not preferable since unevenness in the thickness is increased and flatness of the wafer is deteriorated. On the other band, where the polishing after the epitaxial growth is performed to achieve a small removal amount, the wafer has a large surface roughness, the detection limit of LPD size is larger than 100 nm, and small sized LPDs cannot be detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide, as an intermediate treatment between the epitaxial growth and surface polishing, low-temperature oxide film formation treatment of a main surface of a wafer using a treatment liquid (chemicals, chemical liquid) of a predetermined composition, thereby providing a method of producing an epitaxial wafer, which enables refining of detection limit of LPD size. Another object of the present invention is to provide an epitaxial wafer produced by the above-described method.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, a method of producing an epitaxial wafer in accordance with the present invention is explained with reference to drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the conventional production method of an epitaxial wafer, as exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after slicing a wafer from a silicon single crystal ingot, a main surface of the sliced wafer is chemically etched, and subsequently mirror polished by chemical polishing. Next, on the wafer heated at, for example 1150° C. in a hydrogen atmosphere, a mixture of carrier gas and silicon compound such as silicon tetrachloride, monosilane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), trichlorosilane (SiHCl<sub>3</sub>), and dichlorosilane (SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) is introduced. Using silicon atoms provided by decomposition of the silicon compound, a silicon layer having a thickness of, for example, 2 to 30 μm is epitaxially grown on the surface of the silicon wafer. After that, the main surface of the wafer having the single crystalline silicon layer is subjected to surface mirror polishing by a chemical polishing. Thus an epitaxial wafer is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">However, in the conventional method as described-above, it is impossible to obtain a satisfactory product since the quality of the LPDs and flatness of the wafer is changed depending on the surface state of the wafer after the epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As a result of extensive effort intended to reduce detected size of LPDs, the inventors invented the present invention based on the following findings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Between the epitaxial growth step and surface polishing step, the main surface of a wafer is pretreated in a treatment liquid having a predetermined composition at a temperature of 100° C. or less. Preferably, the treatment liquid may be a liquid which contains oxidizing agent such as ozone and/or hydrogen peroxide. By this treatment which is here referred to as wafer flattening pretreatment, while removing particles adhered to the main surface of the wafer, an oxide film having a predetermined thickness is formed on the main surface. After that, the wafer is further subjected to surface polishing. By the above-described process, it is possible to remarkably improve surface roughness of the wafer and reduce detected size of LPDs on the main surface of the wafer, and reduce numbers of LPDs adhered to the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">That is, a method of producing an epitaxial wafer according to the invention comprises an epitaxial growth step where silicon is epitaxially grown on the main surface of the silicon wafer, and polishing step where the main surface of the silicon wafer is mirror polished. The method further comprises a wafer flattening pretreatment step between the epitaxial growth step and the polishing step. In the wafer flattening pretreatment step, the main surface of the wafer is treated in a treatment liquid of a predetermined composition at a temperature of 100° C. or less, thereby forming an oxide film on the main surface of the wafer while removing particles adhered to the main surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The reason for controlling the treatment temperature at 100° C. or less in the wafer flattening pretreatment step can be explained as follows. The treatment at a temperature higher than 100° C. does not largely improve the effect for removing particles which have adhered to the main surface of the wafer before the treatment. Therefore, it is not preferable to perform the oxidation treatment at a high temperature. Therefore, in the wafer flattening pretreatment step, the treatment temperature was controlled to be 100° C. or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart for explaining a production process of an epitaxial wafer in accordance with the production method of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the method of producing an epitaxial wafer shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after forming a wafer of a predetermined thickness by slicing the wafer from a single crystalline silicon ingot, the main surface of the sliced wafer is chemically etched. After the etching, the wafer is subjected to surface mirror polishing by a chemical polishing. Next, while heating the wafer at a temperature of 1000 to 1180° C., for example 1100° C., mixture of silicon compound and a carrier gas is introduced to the main surface of the wafer. By this step, using silicon atoms decomposed from the silicon compound, a single crystalline silicon layer is epitaxially grown on the surface of the silicon wafer. For example, a single crystalline silicon layer having a thickness of not smaller than 1 μm and smaller than 5 μm is formed on the surface of the wafer. The above-described silicon compound may be selected from silicon compounds such as silicon tetrachloride, monosilane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), tichlorosilane (SiHCl<sub>3</sub>), and dichlorosilane (SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, the wafer is subjected to wafer flattening pretreatment thereby forming an oxide film having a predetermined thickness. After that, the wafer is further subjected to a surface mirror polishing step by chemical polishing. Thus, an epitaxial wafer is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an another embodiment (second embodiment) according to the present invention. A method of producing a silicon wafer according to this embodiment further comprises an edge polishing step before the surface mirror polishing step. In the edge polishing step, an edge portion of the wafer is mirror polished. This embodiment is particularly effective where a correction of irregularity of peripheral thickness of the epitaxial wafer is required in terms of high precision (e.g., precision in flatness).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an another embodiment (third embodiment) according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the wafer flattening pretreatment step is performed in a stage between the epitaxial growth step and the edge polishing step, and also in a stage between the edge polishing step and the surface mirror polishing step. This embodiment is effective where further improvement of a surface roughness of the wafer is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an another embodiment (fourth embodiment) according to the present invention. In this embodiment, in the surface polishing step performed after the epitaxial growth, a front surface (main surface, first surface) and a back surface (second surface) opposite to the front surface are both subjected to mirror polishing. This embodiment is particularly effective where influence of a process gas (e.g., silicon compound gas) reaching the back surface must be corrected in terms of precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In accordance with the methods illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, where necessary, cleaning of the wafer may be performed at intermediate stages between each step. In the surface polishing step performed after the epitaxial growth step, the extent of removal amount (an amount removed by the polishing) is different depending on the method of surface polishing, e.g., a case of polishing the main surface, a case of polishing both surfaces (main surface and back surface), and a case of polishing both surfaces and further polishing the main surface. In any case of the surface polishing method, it is preferable to control the removal amount of the surface polishing to be in a range from 0.1 to 1.0 μm. Where the removal amount is less than 0.1 μm, it is difficult to completely remove the oxide film formed in the wafer flattening pretreatment. Where the removal amount in the polishing step exceeds 1.0 μm, because of too much removal amount, it is impossible to obtain sufficient flatness, and productivity is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">It is preferable that the predetermined thickness of the above-described oxide film is in a range from 5 to 30 Å (0.5 to 3.0 nm). Where the predetermined thickness of the oxide film is thinner than 5 Å, it is likely to occur scratch caused by particles while polishing the wafer. If the time for polishing is shortened, the effect for improving the surface flatness by forming the oxide film is not obtained sufficiently. Where the predetermined thickness of the oxide film is thicker than 30 Å, a long time is required for the polishing treatment because of a slower polishing rate of the oxide film than that of silicon. Because of unevenness (variation) in polishing rate in the wafer plane and unevenness in thickness of the oxide film, fatness of the wafer is degraded. In addition, it is required a long time for polishing. Therefore, a predetermined thickness of the oxide film exceeding 30 Å is not preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">It is preferable that the treatment liquid having a predetermined composition is a liquid which contains an oxidizing agent such as ozone and/or hydrogen peroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The thickness of the above-described oxide film may be controlled by component concentration of cleaning treatment liquid, time and temperature conditions of cleaning. For example, where ozone is contained as the oxidizing agent, it is preferable to treat the wafer in a treatment liquid containing 5 ppm to 40 ppm of ozone in ultrapure water at a temperature of 10 to 30° C. for 10 seconds to 20 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Since the polishing rate of the oxide film is slower than that of silicon and requires a long time for the polishing treatment, it is preferable that the method of producing a semiconductor wafer of the present invention further comprises a step of removing a natural (spontaneous) oxide film using a solution containing hydrofluoric acid before the wafer flattening pretreatment step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Where an epitaxial wafer is produced using the method of the present invention, effect of reducing the detected size of LPD can be recognized in cases of {100} wafer and {111} wafer. Especially, in the case of {110} wafer, the effect of reducing the detected size of LPD is particularly effective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In the epitaxial wafer produced by the above-described production method of the present invention, in the measurement of LPDs using an LPD measuring device utilizing a laser light having a wave length of 300 to 400 nm, it is possible to control the LPD size detected from the main surface of the wafer to be 100 nm or less. It is preferable to control the size of LPD existing on the main surface of the wafer to 65 nm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The epitaxial wafer produced in accordance with the method of the present invention has excellent flatness. Therefore, in the measurement using a LPD measuring device utilizing a laser light having a wave length of 300 to 400 nm, it is possible to control the minimum size of the detected LPD (detection limit size) to be 100 nm or less. It is preferable to control the minimum size of the detected LPD to be 50 nm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Since the detected LPD size can be controlled to be 100 nm or less, preferably to be 65 nm or less in the epitaxial wafer made of (110) crystal produced in accordance with the production method of the present invention, the wafer has excellent surface roughness. Therefore, when measurements of LPDs on the main surface of the wafer is performed using a laser light, it is possible to correctly detect LPDs on the main surface of the wafer. It is more preferable to apply the production method of the present invention to the substrate made of (110) crystal and having an orientation slightly inclined from &lt;110&gt; axis.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In the example, (110) wafers having a thickness of 900 μm were obtained by slicing a silicon single crystal having a diameter of 305 mm. The main surfaces of the sliced wafers were chemically etched using an alkaline solution. After that, a front surface and a back surface of each wafer were subjected to mirror polishing by chemical polishing using colloidal silica. Next, while beating the wafer in a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 1130° C., 5 volumetric % of trichlorosilane (SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) was introduced to the main surfaces of the wafers. By this step, using silicon atoms as decomposition products, an epitaxial silicon layer having a thickness of 3 μm was epitaxially grown on the main surface of each wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, by performing wafer flattening pretreatment in which the wafer was dipped for 1 to 10 minutes in aqueous solution containing 5 ppm of ozone at a temperature of 10 to 20° C., oxide film having a thickness of 10 Å was formed. After that, the main surface of each wafer was subjected to mirror polishing by the chemical polishing using colloidal silica, and a removal amount in the polishing was 0.2 μm. Thus, epitaxial wafers were produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As a Comparative Example, epitaxial wafers were produced in accordance with the similar procedure save not performing the wafer flattening pretreatment step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">LPDs existing on each of test sample wafers (Example and Comparative Example) were measured using the LPD measuring device <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, utilizing laser light for the measurement. In the measurement, laser light having a wave length of 300 to 400 nm was generated from the light source <b>6</b> and was reflected and radiated onto the wafer. The radiated portion of the wafer was moved by moving the wafer in the radial direction while rotating the wafer. Reflected light of a wide angle was introduced to the wide angle light detector <b>7</b> using a mirror condenser, reflected light of a narrow angle was introduced to the narrow angle light detector using lens condensers <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and size and number of LPDs were measured. The results of measurement are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">As it is shown in the results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, detected LPD size was not larger than 65 nm in the present invention (Example). While, in the conventional example (Comparative Example) in which wafer flattening pretreatment was not performed, detected size of LPD was not smaller than 80 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In the measurement using the LPD measuring device <b>1</b> utilizing laser light in the measurement, LPDs of smaller than 80 nm could not be detected on the conventional example because of large noise in the measurement. On the other hand, in the Example, LPD size as small as 45 nm was measured and detected accurately. It can be understood that the (110) wafer ({110} wafer) produced by the method according to the invention had a superior surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In the method of producing an epitaxial wafer in the present invention, between an epitaxial growth step and surface polishing step, the wafer is further subjected to a wafer flattening pretreatment where a main surface of the wafer is treated in a treatment liquid of a predetermined composition at a temperature of 100° C., thereby forming an oxide film of a predetermined thickness while removing particles adhered to the main surface of the wafer. By this constitution, it was made possible to provide a production method of an epitaxial wafer having improved surface roughness, reduced detected size of LPDs and reduced numbers of adhered LPDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Where an epitaxial wafer is produced by the method of the present invention, even when the wafer is an epitaxial wafer made of a (110) crystal, the detected size of LPDs existing on the main surface of the wafer is 100 nm or less. Therefore, it is possible to measure and detect the size and number of LPDs sufficiently correctly using a wafer surface inspection device for measuring LPD on the main surface of the wafer utilizing a laser light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and are not to be considered as limiting.
