<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a silicon wafer, for use in production of an epitaxial silicon wafer, having a mirror-polished surface on one surface and a dopant volatilization preventive film on the other surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">As a wafer from which a discrete semiconductor, a bipolar IC, and so forth are produced, a semiconductor epitaxial wafer has been widely used because of its excellent characteristics. Moreover, for a MOS LSI, the semiconductor epitaxial wafer has also been widely used in a microprocessor unit and a flash memory device because of its excellent soft-error and latch-up characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a semiconductor epitaxial wafer is produced in the following manner, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">First, a single crystal ingot is produced generally by the Czochralski (CZ) method or the floating zone (FZ) method. The produced single crystal ingot is cut into blocks, and subjected to a rounding process (a cylindrical grinding process) to make its diameter uniform. The single crystal ingot block is sliced into a plurality of wafers (a slicing process), and a chamfering process (a beveling process) is performed on the wafer to remove the corner on its periphery. On the wafer, a mechanical grinding process (a lapping process) is then performed to remove its surface irregularities, improve its flatness, and minimize machining strain produced in the slicing process. Then, a machining strain layer formed in a surface layer of the wafer in the mechanical grinding process is removed, for example, by mixed acid etching (an etching process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Next, a protective film for preventing automatic doping (a dopant volatilization preventive film) is formed at least on the back surface of the wafer. A mirror polishing process is then performed to polish the front surface of the semiconductor wafer into a mirror-polished surface by chemical and mechanical polishing (CMP), and on the mirror-polished surface, an epitaxial film is formed; through these processes, a semiconductor epitaxial wafer is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, an additional explanation of automatic doping is provided. In an epitaxial process of growing a single crystal thin film (an epitaxial film) on a wafer by chemical-vapor deposition, the wafer is generally exposed to a high temperature of about 1000 to 1200° C. At this time, an automatic doping phenomenon occurs, a phenomenon in which dopant contained in the wafer is volatilized and taken into the epitaxial film during the process of forming the epitaxial film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, in production of a semiconductor epitaxial wafer for a power MOS, a low resistivity wafer whose conductivity type is P-type or N-type, heavily doped with impurities, has been used as a substrate for forming an epitaxial film; in this case, the occurrence of automatic doping becomes remarkable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, when such a heavily-doped wafer is heated, an automatic doping phenomenon in which impurities such as boron, phosphorus, antimony, and arsenic with which the wafer is doped escape from the wafer and enter the epitaxial film occurs in a wafer without a dopant volatilization preventive film, which makes it impossible to obtain an epitaxial film having a desired resistivity. As a result, the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor epitaxial wafer change, and a semiconductor device fabricated by using this semiconductor epitaxial wafer does not exhibit characteristics as designed and becomes a failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, as described earlier, to prevent automatic doping, a dopant volatilization preventive film on the back surface of a wafer is needed. Since high flatness is particularly required in a large-diameter wafer such as a 300-mm-diameter wafer, after double-side polishing is performed to planarize the wafer, an oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film is formed on the back surface of the wafer by chemical-vapor deposition (CVD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Then, in the above-described mirror polishing process, the front surface side of the silicon wafer, that is, the side on which an epitaxial film is to be grown by chemical-vapor deposition is mirror-polished by single-side polishing. In the single-side polishing, since strain is produced in the silicon surface in a process of forming an oxide film by CVD, the mirror-polished surface needs to be finished by polishing the silicon front surface side at least up to several micrometers to remove the strain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">However, there arises a problem that the wafer flatness is degraded by single-side polishing with a stock removal required to remove the strain produced in the oxide film formation process by CVD. In recent years, there is a necessity to improve the degraded flatness of the wafer to meet an increasing need for a wafer with higher flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for producing a semiconductor wafer, enabling a highly flat wafer having a mirror-polished surface and a rough surface to be produced by polishing with a double-side polishing apparatus a wafer on which an oxide film is grown on one surface by CVD.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">This method, however, aims merely at producing a highly flat wafer having a rough surface, and removes the oxide film by the double-side polishing. Moreover, even when the thickness of the oxide film and the stock removal at the time of double-side polishing are adjusted to leave the oxide film in this method, the oxide film is thinned by polishing or a scratch is generated on the oxide-film surface; thus there arises a problem in that the oxide film lacks its quality to serve as a dopant volatilization preventive film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been made in view of the problems described above and an object thereof is to provide a method that can produce a silicon wafer with high flatness and maintain the quality of an oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film by suppressing a scratch and a polishing amount of the oxide film.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">To attain the above-described object, the present invention provides a method for producing a silicon wafer with a mirror-polished surface and an oxide-film surface by growing an oxide film on one surface of a raw material silicon wafer by chemical-vapor deposition and then polishing a surface of the raw material silicon wafer on a side on which the oxide film is not grown, the method comprising a step of, after growing the oxide film, performing double-side polishing of the raw material silicon wafer in such a manner to use for the oxide-film surface a suede polishing pad, obtained by wet coagulating and foaming urethane resin after the urethane resin is applied, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90°, or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90°, and to use for the surface to be polished on the side on which the oxide film is not grown an urethane closed-cell foam polishing pad or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 90° or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">With such a production method, in double-side polishing, the oxide film can be suppressed from scratching without being excessively polished and the silicon wafer can be polished highly flat; a silicon wafer with high flatness in which the quality of an oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film is maintained can be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">At this time, after the step of performing double-side polishing, the mirror-polished surface may be polished by using a single-side polishing apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In this manner, it is possible to further improve the flatness of the silicon wafer and finish the mirror-polished surface with high precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, at this time, as the raw material silicon wafer, a silicon wafer with a resistivity of 0.1 Ω·cm or less may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Even when such a low resistivity silicon wafer, which tends to cause automatic doping later in an epitaxial wafer process, is used, the present invention enables production of a silicon wafer that can suppress a scratch on the oxide film for serving as a dopant volatilization preventive film and surely prevent automatic doping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, at this time, the asker-C rubber hardness of the polishing pad used for the oxide-film surface is preferably 50° or more but 70° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In this manner, it is possible more surely to suppress a scratch on the oxide film and to polish the silicon wafer highly flat.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present invention, after growing an oxide film on one surface of a raw material silicon wafer by chemical-vapor deposition, double-side polishing of the raw material silicon wafer is performed in such a manner to use for the oxide-film surface a suede polishing pad, obtained by wet coagulating and foaming urethane resin after the urethane resin is applied, or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90°, and to use for the surface to be polished on the side on which the oxide film is not grown an urethane closed-cell foam polishing pad or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 90° or more; therefore, in double-side polishing, the oxide film can be suppressed from scratching without being excessively polished and the silicon wafer can be polished highly flat; a silicon wafer with high flatness in which the quality of an oxide film for serving as a dopant volatilization preventive film is maintained can be produced.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In general, on the back surface of a silicon wafer for use in production of a semiconductor epitaxial wafer, an oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film is formed to prevent automatic doping. This oxide film is formed by CVD, but, the CVD produces strain in a silicon surface. To remove this strain, single-side polishing with a stock removal of several micrometers or more is needed in a process of finishing into a mirror-polished surface a surface on the side on which an epitaxial film is to be grown by chemical-vapor deposition. However, the single-side polishing with such a stock removal degrades the wafer's flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Conventionally, a method for producing a semiconductor wafer, producing a highly flat wafer having a mirror surface and a rough surface by polishing with a double-side polishing apparatus a wafer on which an oxide film is grown on one surface by CVD, has been known. In this method, however, polishing thins the oxide film or generates a scratch on the oxide-film surface, making it impossible for the oxide film to function as a dopant volatilization preventive film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, with, it is difficult for the conventional method to produce a wafer with high flatness while maintaining the quality of an oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, the inventors conducted intensive studies to solve such a problem. As a result, the inventors have found out the following: double-side polishing is performed to mirror-polish a surface on the side on which an epitaxial film is to be grown by chemical-vapor deposition; upper and lower polishing pads used in the double-side polishing are made of such material and have such hardness as defined in the present invention; in this way, a wafer with high flatness can be produced while the quality of an oxide film is maintained. The inventors thereby completed the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method for producing a silicon wafer of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">First, a raw material silicon wafer having one surface on which an oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization is formed is prepared in the following manner. Note the following: the processes performed before the growth of the oxide film are in principle the same as those of the conventional method; hereinafter, a surface of a raw material silicon wafer on the side on which an oxide film is to be formed is sometimes referred to as a back surface, and a surface on the side on which the oxide film is not formed but an epitaxial film is to be formed after mirror polishing is sometimes referred to as a front surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, a silicon ingot is produced by the CZ method, or the FZ method. Then, the produced silicon ingot is cut into blocks with a predetermined length, and subjected to a rounding process (a cylindrical grinding process) to make its diameter uniform. The silicon ingot is then sliced into wafers (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (a), a slicing process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, a chamfering process (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (b), a beveling process) is performed on the sliced raw material silicon wafer to remove the corner on its periphery. On the wafer, a mechanical grinding process (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (c), a lapping process) is then performed to remove its surface irregularities, improve its flatness, and minimize machining strain produced in the slicing process, and a machining strain layer formed in a surface layer of the wafer in the mechanical grinding process is removed, for example, by mixed acid etching (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (d), an etching process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, to further improve the flatness of the wafer, double-side polishing can be performed on the wafer, before the later-described process of growing a dopant volatilization prevention oxide film, for example, after the above-described etching process. Since higher flatness is particularly required when a large-diameter wafer such as a 300-mm-diameter wafer is produced, such double-side polishing is preferably performed. Here, a polishing pad that is used in this double-side polishing is not limited in particular; a conventional polishing pad may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, an oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization is grown on the back surface of the raw material silicon wafer to prevent automatic doping (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (e), a dopant volatilization prevention oxide film growth process). The grown oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization can strongly prevent heavily-doped dopant in the wafer from being volatilized and taken into an epitaxial film, for example, in a process of forming epitaxial film or other heat treatment processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Here, as the oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization, a silicon oxide film can be formed. The silicon dioxide film can be easily formed by deposition in an atmospheric CVD method, or formation of a thermal oxide film by thermal oxidation and can be produced at low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, an outer periphery of the oxide film for preventing dopant volatilization may be removed by an etching or a machining process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, double-side polishing is performed on the raw material silicon wafer having the oxide film grown on the back surface to finish the front surface side into a mirror-polished surface (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at (f), a mirror polishing process by double-side polishing). This double-side polishing is performed by using a double-side polishing apparatus depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the double-side polishing apparatus <b>10</b> includes an upper turn table <b>11</b> and a lower turn table <b>12</b> that are provided such that they face to one another. Polishing pads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are attached to the sides, facing to one another, of the upper and lower turn tables <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively. The upper and lower turn tables <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> can each rotate in a direction opposite to one another by upper and lower turn table rotating shafts <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The lower turn table <b>12</b> has a sun gear <b>15</b> provided at its center and an annular internal gear <b>16</b> provided at its outer edge. Between an upper surface of the polishing pad <b>22</b> attached to the lower turn table <b>12</b> and a lower surface of the polishing pad <b>21</b> attached to the upper turn table <b>11</b>, a carrier <b>17</b> having a holding hole for holding a wafer W is placed. Then, as a result of the carrier <b>17</b> rotating about its axis and revolving by the action of the sun gear <b>15</b> and the internal gear <b>16</b>, the front and back surfaces of the wafer W held in the holding hole of the carrier <b>17</b> are rubbed and polished between the upper and lower polishing pads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present invention, as the upper and lower polishing pads used at the time of the double-side polishing, the following polishing pads are used: a suede polishing pad, obtained by wet coagulating and foaming urethane resin after the urethane resin is applied, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90°, more preferably 50° or more but less than 70°, or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90°, more preferably 50° or more but less than 70°, is used for the side on which the oxide film is formed (for the oxide-film surface); an urethane closed-cell foam polishing pad or a velour polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 90° or more is used for the surface to be polished on the side on which the oxide film is not grown (the surface to be mirror-polished).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, the raw material silicon wafer W is polished by rotating and revolving the carrier <b>17</b> holding the raw material silicon wafer W while a polishing agent is supplied from a plurality of polishing agent feeding openings <b>18</b> disposed in the upper turn table <b>11</b>, and the upper and lower turn tables <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are rotated and presses the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, when the suede polishing pad or the velour polishing pad with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more but less than 90° is used for the oxide-film surface, the oxide film can be suppressed more surely from being polished and effectively from generating a scratch. That is, it is possible to surely ensure the quality of the oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film for preventing automatic doping in a subsequent epitaxial process. Moreover, when the polishing pad with an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° or more is used, an adverse effect on the wafer flatness due to an excessively soft polishing pad can be surely avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, when an urethane closed-cell foam polishing pad or a velour based polishing pad, obtained by impregnating a nonwoven fabric with urethane resin, with an asker-C rubber hardness of 90° or more is used for the surface to be mirror-polished in combination with the above-described polishing pad for the oxide-film surface, a silicon wafer with high flatness, having a mirror-polished front surface, can be obtained. Here, an upper limit to the hardness of the polishing pad used for the surface to be mirror-polished is not limited particularly; currently, a polishing pad with a hardness of up to about 95° is available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Incidentally, a polishing agent to be used is not limited particularly; for example, colloidal silica or fumed silica may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">At this time, after a process of performing double-side polishing, the surface to be mirror-polished of the wafer can be further polished by using a single-side polishing apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In this manner, it is possible to finish the mirror-polished surface of the wafer with high precision and further improve the flatness of the silicon wafer. In the present invention, since the strain of the silicon surface due to CVD has been already removed by the above-described double-side polishing, a large stock removal is unnecessary in this single-side polishing; therefore the single-side polishing does not degrade the wafer's flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, as the raw material silicon wafer, a silicon wafer with a resistivity of 0.1 Ω·cm or less can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Conventionally, automatic doping in an epitaxial process tends to occur remarkably when a low resistivity wafer heavily-doped with impurities is used. In the present invention, however, even when such a low resistivity silicon wafer is used, it is possible to produce a silicon wafer with high flatness, having a dopant volatilization preventive oxide film that can surely prevent automatic doping.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described more specifically with examples and comparative examples of the present invention, but the present invention is not limited to these examples.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Examples 1-5</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">A silicon single crystal wafer was produced by the method for producing a silicon wafer of the present invention, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the incidence of scratches on the oxide-film surface was evaluated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">First, a silicon single crystal ingot was grew up by the CZ method and was sliced to prepare 600 raw material silicon single crystal wafers having a diameter of 300 mm, crystal orientation &lt;100&gt;, and a conductivity type of P-type. The edge portions of these wafers were chamfered, lapping was performed, and etching was performed to remove residual strain produced by the lapping. Then, both surfaces were mirror-polished to make the wafers highly flat, and the edge portions were chamfered into mirror-polished portions to reduce particles from the edge portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, a 4000-angstrom oxide film was grown on the back surface of the raw material silicon single crystal wafer by CVD, and a part of the oxide film on the edge portion was removed by etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, with the double-side polishing apparatus depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, double-side polishing was performed while the raw material silicon single crystal wafer was held such that the oxide-film surface faced downward. In the double-polishing, an urethane closed-cell foam polishing pad with an asker-C rubber hardness of 90° was used for the side to be mirror-polished, that is, the surface to be polished on the side on which the oxide film was not grown (the upper side); a suede polishing pad was used for the oxide-film surface (the lower side), and the suede polishing pad had the following hardness: an asker-C rubber hardness of 85° (Example 1), an asker-C rubber hardness of 80° (Example 2), an asker-C rubber hardness of 70° (Example 3), an asker-C rubber hardness of 65° (Example 4), and an asker-C rubber hardness of 50° (Example 5). The double-side polishing was performed each on 100 wafers among the above-described raw material silicon single crystal wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The following are double-side polishing conditions. Incidentally, the stock removal was a value for the silicon single crystal surface on the side to be mirror-polished and was set at 4 μm to remove the strain produced in the silicon single crystal surface in the process of forming the oxide film by CVD. Moreover, the polishing time was set at 40 minutes because investigation, conducted in advance, showed that the polishing rate of the silicon single crystal surface was 0.1 μm/min in all examples under the following polishing conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Raw material wafer: P-type, crystal orientation &lt;100&gt;, 300 mm in diameter</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Lower polishing pad: a suede polishing pad, an asker-C rubber hardness of 85° to 50°</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Stock removal: 4 μm</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">After the double-side polishing, the mirror-polished surface of the silicon single crystal wafer was finished with a stock removal of 1 μm by using the single-side polishing apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Then, the incidence of scratches on the oxide film of the silicon single crystal wafer was evaluated by visually checking the presence or absence of a scratch under a fluorescent light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The results are depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here, the incidence of scratches in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents values with respect to when the incidence of scratches in the later-described Comparative Example 1 is defined as ‘1’. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is a correlation between the hardness of a polishing pad and the incidence of scratches: the lower the hardness of a polishing pad, the smaller the number of scratches. In addition, scratches are greatly suppressed in comparison with the result of Comparative Example 1; in particular when the asker-C rubber hardness is 70° or less, scratches are reduced to 1/10 or less of those of Comparative Example 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, evaluation of decrease in oxide film thickness revealed that, in all examples, the oxide films decreased in thickness by about 30 nm and were hardly polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, it was confirmed that the method for producing a silicon wafer of the invention can produce a silicon wafer with high flatness and maintain the quality of an oxide film as a dopant volatilization preventive film by suppressing a scratch and a polishing amount of the oxide film.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Example 6</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Under conditions similar to those of Example 3 (the asker-C rubber hardness of a lower polishing pad was 70°) except that the asker-C hardness of a polishing pad for the side to be mirror-polished (the upper side) was set at 95°, 300 silicon single crystal wafers were produced, and the flatness thereof were evaluated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Incidentally, as the flatness, an SFQR (MAX) was measured by an AFS apparatus manufactured by ADE Corporation in conditions of a site size of 26 mm×8 mm with the edge exclusion of 2 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The result is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the value obtained in Example 3.
