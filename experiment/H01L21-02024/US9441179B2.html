<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a silicon wafer processing fluid and silicon wafer processing method.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to produce silicon wafers, processes including slicing a silicon ingot and polishing the silicon wafers are performed. For instance, a silicon ingot is sliced while supplying processing fluid to a wire. A silicon ingot is sliced according to either a loose abrasive method in which the silicon ingot is sliced while dispersing abrasive grains in the processing fluid or a fixed grain method in which the silicon ingot is sliced with the abrasive grains being rigidly attached on a surface of a wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The processing fluid used for the loose abrasive method includes an aqueous processing fluid containing, for instance, a friction coefficient reducer, an auxiliary corrosion-resistance agent and the like. The friction-coefficient reducer contained in the processing fluid is an unsaturated fatty acid. The auxiliary corrosion-resistance agent is benzotriazole (see Patent Literature 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The processing fluid used for the fixed grain method includes an aqueous processing fluid containing, for instance, glycols, carboxylic acids, alcanolamines and the like (see Patent Literature 2).</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the loose abrasive method as disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a large margin is required when a thick wire is used, so that a large amount of chips are generated and the yield rate after slicing a silicon ingot is deteriorated. On the other hand, since the wire is worn after being used, there naturally is a limit for reducing a diameter of the wire. Accordingly, the loose abrasive method is not productive as required for use in manufacturing silicon wafers for solar cells and the like, of which production is expected to greatly increase in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the fixed grain method as disclosed in Patent Literature 2, since abrasive grains are rigidly attached to a wire in advance, the diameter of the wire can be reduced and less amount of chips are produced. However, the abrasive grains are worn or fallen off in accordance with the use of the wire in the fixed grain method. Consequently, the yield rate is deteriorated due to the breakage of the wire or the decrease in the processing efficiency and slicing accuracy. Further, the chips may be reacted with water to generate hydrogen, so that the processing fluid may spill over a processing fluid tank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the invention is to provide a silicon wafer processing fluid and a silicon wafer processing method capable of restraining abrasion of abrasive grains and generation of hydrogen.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0020">According to the invention, a silicon wafer processing fluid and a silicon wafer processing method capable of restraining abrasion of abrasive grains and generation of hydrogen can be provided.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0021">A silicon-wafer processing fluid of the invention (sometimes referred to as “processing fluid” hereinafter) is used for processing a silicon wafer with a wire. In the following description, the processing fluid of the invention is used for slicing a silicon ingot according to the fixed grain method. However, the processing fluid of the invention may be used in the loose abrasive method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0022">The processing fluid of the invention contains a friction modifier. The friction modifier contains a nitrogen-containing compound, pH of the nitrogen-containing compound being in a range from 2 to 8 when a mass ratio with water (i.e. nitrogen-containing compound/water) is 1/99.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0023">When pH is less than 2, the wire, wire saw and silicon may be corroded. On the other hand, when pH exceeds 8, the friction coefficient in slicing the silicon ingot is increased (i.e. friction is increased). Thus, it is preferable that pH is in a range from 3 to 7, more preferably in a range from 4 to 6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0024">The nitrogen-containing compound having pH of the above specific range is, for instance, a heterocyclic compound, which specifically is benzotriazole, 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine, indazole, benzimidazole and derivatives thereof. Among the above, benzotriazole and 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0025">With the use of nitrogen-containing compound of the invention, the lubricity of the wire is enhanced, so that abrasion of the abrasive grains rigidly attached on the wire can be restrained and the abrasive grains can be kept from being fallen off from the wire. Accordingly, breakage of the wire can be prevented and the processing efficiency and slicing accuracy can be enhanced, thereby improving the yield rate. Further, the nitrogen-containing compound restrains the generation of hydrogen due to the reaction between the chips of a silicon ingot and water. As a result, the processing fluid is kept from spilling over the processing fluid tank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0026">Further, it is preferable that pH of the processing fluid of the invention is in a range from 3 to 9, more preferably in a range from 5 to 7. Since the pH of the processing fluid is in a range from medium acidity to mild alkalinity, the generation of hydrogen can be further restrained. In addition, the corrosion of wire and silicon can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0027">It is preferable that the content of the nitrogen-containing compound in the invention is in a range from 0.05 to 10 mass % based on a total amount of the processing fluid, more preferably in a range from 0.1 to 5 mass %. Since the content is at least 0.05 mass %, the abrasion of abrasive grains and generation of hydrogen can be further restrained and corrosion of wire and silicon can be prevented. On the other hand, since the content is at most 10 mass %, the production cost can be restrained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0028">The processing fluid of the invention contains water. The water may be of any kind of water including tap water and purified water. The content of water is preferably in a range from 50 to 99.95 mass %, more preferably in a range from 60 to 95 mass %. When the content of water is at least 50 mass %, environmental burden can be reduced as compared to ethyleneglycol that is conventionally used as a main component. Further, since water is the main component, inflammability can be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0029">Next, the silicon-wafer processing method of the invention will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0030">The silicon-wafer processing method of the invention is, for instance, a fixed grain method, where abrasive grains are rigidly attached on a wire in advance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0031">In performing the silicon-wafer processing method of the invention, a silicon ingot is introduced into a processing chamber of a wire saw in which the wire is stretched around.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0032">Then, the silicon ingot is sliced while supplying the processing fluid of the invention to the wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0033">Since the processing fluid of the invention contains the nitrogen-containing compound having pH of a specific range, abrasion of the abrasive grains can be prevented. Further, though the chips of the silicon ingot are generated, the nitrogen-containing compound of the invention restrains the reaction between the chips and water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0034">It should be noted that the processing fluid of the invention may be added with known additive(s) including friction modifier, antifoaming agent, metal deactivator, bactericide (preservative), viscosity modifier, pH modifier, thickener, dispersant and the like, as long as the addition of the additive(s) is not inconsistent with an object of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0035">The friction modifier is used for restraining the abrasion of the abrasive grains. Various surfactants and water-soluble polymer compounds are usable as the friction modifier. Examples of the surfactant include non-ionic surfactant such as glycols. Examples of the water-soluble polymer compound include carboxylic acid polymer compounds such as polyacrylic acid and alkyleneglycol polymer compounds such as polyethylene glycol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0036">The antifoaming agent is used for keeping the processing fluid from spilling out of the processing fluid tank provided inside the processing chamber. Examples of the antifoaming agent include silicone oil, fluorosilicone oil and fluoroalkylether.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0037">Examples of the metal deactivator include imidazoline, pyrimidine derivative, thiadiazole and benzotriazole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0038">The bactericide (preservative) is used for preventing corrosion of the wire and the like. Examples of the bactericide (preservative) include paraoxy benzoic acid esters (parabens), benzoic acid, salicylic acid, sorbic acid, dehydroacetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acids and salts thereof, and phenoxyethanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0039">The pH modifier is used for adjusting the pH of the processing fluid of the invention in a range from 3 to 9. The pH modifier is classified into an acidic modifier and a basic modifier. Examples of the acidic modifier include acidic compounds such as polyacrylic acid and isononanoic acid. Examples of the basic modifier include basic compounds such as N-methyldiethanolamine and cyclohexyl diethanolamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0040">The thickener is used for increasing the viscosity of the processing fluid of the invention to improve adherability to the wire. Thus, the abrasion of the abrasive grains can be restrained. Examples of the thickener include carboxylic acid polymer compounds and alkyleneglycol polymer compounds similar to the friction modifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0041">The dispersant is used for restraining the chips from depositing on the wire saw. Examples of the dispersant include various surfactants and water-soluble polymers similar to the friction modifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0042">The content of the additives may be determined in accordance with the intended use of the processing fluid. However, the total content of the additives is usually in a range approximately from 0.01 mass % to 30 mass % based on the total amount of the processing fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0043">Though the processing fluid of the invention is used for slicing a silicon ingot in the above description, the processing fluid of the invention may be used for polishing a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0044">Further, the manufacturing method of the processing fluid of the invention is not specifically limited. For instance, in terms of convenience in transportation and sales, the processing fluid may be prepared in a condensed state in which less amount of water is contained, and water may be added before use to adjust the concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0045">Though the main component of the processing fluid of the invention is water in the above description, glycols may alternatively be used as the main component.</div>

Evaluation Results
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0078">As is shown in the results of Examples 1 to 3 in Table 1, the processing fluid of the invention reduces the friction coefficient due to the presence of a predetermined nitrogen-containing compound. Thus, the processing fluid restrains the abrasion of the abrasive grains and keeps the abrasive grains from being fallen off. Further, the processing fluid of the invention reduces the amount of generated hydrogen, so that the processing fluid is kept from spilling out of a processing fluid tank. Further, since the main component of the processing fluid of the invention is water, the processing fluid imposes less environmental burden and exhibits excellent source-saving performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0079">In contrast, since the Comparatives 1 to 5 do not contain the nitrogen-containing compound of a predetermined pH as a friction modifier as required by the invention, increase in both the friction coefficient and generated hydrogen cannot be restrained. Further, since the main component of the processing fluid of Comparative 4 is propylene glycol, the processing fluid imposes larger environmental burden and exhibits poor source-saving performance.</div>
