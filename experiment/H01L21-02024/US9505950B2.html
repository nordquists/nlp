<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Surface defects referred to as light point defects (LPDs) may occur on the substrate surface polished by a polishing composition. The present invention is based on the observation that the weight average molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution represented by weight average molecular weight (Mw)/number average molecular weight (Mn) of the water-soluble polymer contained in the polishing composition are correlated with the reduction level of the LPDs. Patent Document 1 does not refer to such a correlation.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described below and design changes are possible as long as the contents of the invention are not adversely affected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The polishing composition comprises a water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 1000000 or less and a molecular weight distribution represented by weight average molecular weight (Mw)/number average molecular weight (Mn) that is less than 5.0. The polishing composition of the present embodiment is used in an application for polishing a substrate such as a silicon substrate or a compound semiconductor substrate. A process for polishing a substrate includes, for example, pre-polishing (e.g., primary polishing or secondary polishing), which flattens the surface of a disk-shaped substrate sliced from a monocrystal ingot, and final polishing, which removes fine irregularities from the substrate surface after the pre-polishing to mirror-finish the surface. The polishing composition is suitable for use in both the pre-polishing and the final polishing of the substrate. The polishing composition of the present embodiment is further suitable for use when finally polishing the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The polishing composition of the present embodiment can contain abrasive grains, a basic compound, and water as components other than the water-soluble polymer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The water-soluble polymer functions to increase the wettability of the polished surface. Water-soluble polymer having a small molecular weight distribution easily reduces LPDs. As described above, the molecular weight distribution of the water-soluble polymer used in the polishing composition is less than 5.0, preferably 4.9 or less, further preferably 4.8 or less, and further preferably 4.7 or less, and most preferably 4.6 or less. The molecular weight distribution of the water-soluble polymer is theoretically 1.0 or greater. As the molecular weight distribution of the water-soluble polymer increases, the wettability of the polished surface increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The molecular weight distribution of the water-soluble polymer is also referred to as a polydispersity index (PDI). The weight average molecular weight (Mw) is presented in polyethylene oxide equivalent.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The above-described major axis/minor axis ratio is a value related to the shape of the abrasive grain and can be obtained using, for example, using an electron microscope image of the abrasive grain. Specifically, a minimum circumscribed rectangle is illustrated for each abrasive grain in a scanning electron microscope image of a predetermined number of abrasive grains (e.g., 200 grains). Subsequently, for each minimum circumscribed rectangle, the length of the long side (major axis value) is divided by the length of the short side (minor axis value) to calculate the value of the major axis/minor axis ratio.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The polishing composition may include a chelating agent. The chelating agent captures metal impurities in the polishing system to form complexes. This reduces the residual level of metal impurities on the substrate. The metal impurities in the polishing system include, for example, impurities derived from the raw materials for the polishing composition, impurities generated from the polishing surface or the polishing apparatus during polishing, and contaminants from the ambient environment. Particularly, when the substrate is a semiconductor substrate, reduction in the residual level of the metal impurities prevents metallic contamination of the semiconductor substrate and limits deterioration in the quality of the semiconductor substrate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The polishing composition may include a surfactant. The surfactant reduces the roughness of the polished surface. This easily reduces the haze level of the polished surface. Particularly, when the polishing composition contains the basic compound, the polished surface tends to be rough due to the chemical etching with the basic compound.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">When the stock solution contains abrasive grains and the water-soluble polymer having the above-described weight average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, the grains in the polishing composition prepared through the diluting step have suitable dispersibility. The grains include single bodies of abrasive grains and an agglomerate of the abrasive grains and the water-soluble polymer. The dispersibility of the grains in the polishing composition can be evaluated based on the measured value for the volume average grain diameter of the grains contained in the polishing composition. The volume average grain diameter can be obtained through, for example, a dynamic light scattering method using a grain diameter distribution measuring apparatus (model “UPA-UT151”, Nikkiso Co., Ltd.). It is understood that the dispersibility of the grains in the polishing composition is important for reducing the LPDs. The above-described water-soluble polymer is also advantageous from the viewpoint of increasing the dispersibility of the grains. Further, the use of the water-soluble polymer described above further easily reduces the LPDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, the volume average grain diameter of the grains contained in the polishing composition obtained by diluting the stock solution is 10 nm or greater, further preferably 30 nm or greater, and even further preferably 40 nm or greater.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">A method for manufacturing a substrate will now be described together with the operation of the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">A substrate is manufactured by a method including a polishing step that uses the polishing composition. In the polishing step, a polishing pad is pressed against the surface of the substrate. Further, the substrate and the polishing pad are rotated while feeding the polishing composition to the surface of the substrate. During polishing, it is presumed that a higher solubility or dispersibility of the water-soluble polymer is obtained since the polishing composition contains the water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 1000000 or less and a molecular weight distribution less than 5.0. It is presumed that this easily reduces the LPDs detected on the polished surface of the semiconductor substrate. The substrate that has undergone the polishing process then undergoes the washing step for washing the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The embodiment described above in detail has the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">(1) The polishing composition enables easy reduction of the LPDs on the polished surface since it contains the water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 1000000 or less and a molecular weight distribution of less than 5.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">(2) When prepared in the form of a stock solution containing abrasive grains and the water-soluble polymer, the polishing composition is easily stored and transported.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">(3) When used in an application for polishing a substrate, the polishing composition can easily provide a substrate having reduced LPDs on the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">(4) The polishing composition is used for final polishing of a substrate. This contributes to quality improvement since the LPDs are reduced in the substrate after final polishing, which requires high quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">(5) The method for manufacturing a substrate facilitates manufacturing of a substrate having reduced LPDs since the method includes the polishing step for polishing the substrate using the polishing composition containing the water-soluble polymer having a molecular weight distribution of less than 5.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The embodiment described above may be modified as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition may be, for example, adjusted by mixing a plurality of water-soluble polymers having different weight average molecular weights. That is, when the water-soluble polymer in the polishing composition is composed of a plurality of water-soluble polymers, the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the water-soluble polymers as a whole only needs to be less than 5.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The polishing composition may be of a one-pack-type or a multi-pack-type of two or more packs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Each component contained in the polishing composition or stock solution may be filtered just before manufacturing. Further, the polishing composition that is used may be filtered before use. The filtering of the polishing composition removes coarse foreign matter from the polishing composition and improves the quality. The polishing composition contains the water-soluble polymer having a molecular weight distribution of less than 5.0. This reduces clogging of the filter used for the filtering and easily achieves satisfactory filtering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The material and the structure of the filter used for the filtering described above are not particularly limited. The materials of the filter include, for example, cellulose, nylon, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate, and glass. The structure of the filter includes, for example, a depth filter, a pleated filter and a membrane filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The polishing pad used in the polishing process using the polishing composition is not particularly limited. For example, any of a nonwoven cloth type, a suede type, those containing an abrasive grain, and those not containing an abrasive grain may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">When polishing a substrate using the polishing composition, the polishing composition once used for polishing may be recovered and reused to polish the substrate. The method for reusing the polishing composition include, for example, recovering the used polishing composition discharged from the polishing apparatus in a tank and then circulating the polishing composition again to the polishing apparatus from the tank. The reuse of the polishing composition reduces the discharged amount of the polishing composition that becomes waste liquid and decreases the consumption of the polishing composition. This is advantageous in that the load on the environment can be reduced and in that the cost for polishing the substrate can be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">During reuse of the polishing composition, components such as the abrasive grains are consumed or lost during polishing. Therefore, the polishing compositing is preferably replenished by an amount corresponding to the decreased amount of the components such as the abrasive grains. The replenished components may be individually added to the polishing composition, or alternatively, added as a mixture containing two or more of the components in any concentration to the polishing composition depending on the tank capacity, polishing conditions or the like. By replenishing each of the components in the amount corresponding to the decrease in the reused polishing composition, the composition of the polishing composition is sustained so that the functions of the polishing composition are continuously maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The material of a compound semiconductor substrate subject to polishing with the polishing composition includes silicon carbide, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide, and the like. The application of the polishing composition is not limited to polishing a semiconductor substrate. The polishing composition may also be applied to substrates formed from a metals such as stainless steel, a plastic, glass, sapphire, or the like, and in methods for manufacturing such substrates. Also in these cases, the LPDs on the polished surface can be easily reduced. In addition, the polishing composition can be also used for obtaining not only substrates but also polished products formed from any of various materials.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The haze level of each silicon substrate was determined based on the measurement of the polished surface after the polishing process using a wafer inspection apparatus (Surfscan SP2 (product name), KLA-Tencor Corporation) in DWO mode of the apparatus. Cases in which the measured values were less than 0.110 ppm, 0.110 ppm or greater and less than 0.120 ppm, 0.120 ppm or greater and less than 0.130 ppm, 0.130 ppm or greater and less than 0.140 ppm, and 0.140 ppm or greater were determined as “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, and “E”, respectively. The determination results are shown in the “Haze” column in Table 1.</div>
