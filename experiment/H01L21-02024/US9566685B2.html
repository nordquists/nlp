<heading id="h-0009">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0010">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Polishing compositions (especially polishing compositions for precision polishing) for polishing semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers as well as other substrates are expected to have abilities to produce surfaces with low haze and a fewer number of micro particles (light point defect or LPD) after polishing. Many of polishing compositions for such purposes comprise, besides water and an abrasive, a water-soluble polymer for protecting the surface of a polishing object (work piece) or increasing the wettability, etc. of the same. Among them, hydroxyethyl cellulose is cited as a widely used water-soluble polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is a polymer derived from a natural compound (cellulose), there are limitations in managing the chemical structure and purity as compared with a polymer obtainable by artificial polymerization of monomers (or a synthetic polymer, hereinafter). For instance, because the structural control is harder than for synthetic polymers, commercially readily available HECs are limited in weight average molecular weight and range of molecular weight distribution (ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn)). In addition, since they are derived from natural compounds, it is difficult to significantly reduce impurities and local disorder (microscale aggregation, etc.) in their polymer structures, etc., that may cause surface defect, and the amounts and extent of such impurities, etc. are likely to vary easily. As more strict requirements are expected for surface quality in the future, it will be useful to provide a polishing composition excellent in reducing the number of LPD and haze, with the composition not essentially requiring an HEC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of such circumstances, an objective of the present invention is to provide a polishing composition excellent in reducing the number of LPD and haze. Another related invention provides a method for producing a polished article, using such a polishing composition.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The polishing composition provided by this specification comprises an abrasive, a water-soluble polymer and water. The polishing composition comprises, as the water-soluble polymer, a polymer A having an adsorption ratio of lower than 5% based on the adsorption ratio measurement described below and a polymer B having an adsorption ratio of 5% or higher, but lower than 95% based on the adsorption measurement. Herein, the polymer B is selected from polymers excluding hydroxyethyl celluloses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">[Adsorption Ratio Measurement]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">(1) A test solution L0 is obtained, comprising 0.018% by mass of a measured polymer and 0.01% by mass of ammonia with the rest being water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">(2) A test solution L1 is obtained, comprising 0.18% by mass of the abrasive as well as 0.018% by mass of the measured polymer and 0.01% by mass of ammonia with the rest being water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">(3) The test solution L1 is centrifuged to precipitate the abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">(4) From the mass W0 of the measured polymer in the test solution L0 and mass W1 of the measured polymer in the supernatant of the centrifuged test solution L1, the adsorption ratio of the measured polymer is determined by the next equation:
<br/>
Adsorption ratio (%)=[(<i>W</i>0−<i>W</i>1)/<i>W</i>0]×100
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to such a polishing composition, the combined use of the polymer A and polymer B showing the respective prescribed adsorption ratios relative to the abrasive can effectively improve the performance (e.g. reduction of the number of LPD, reduction of haze, etc.) of the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A preferable polymer B has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn) ratio (Mw/Mn; “molecular weight distribution”, hereinafter) of 5.0 or lower. The use of a polymer B with such a narrow molecular weight distribution can bring about effects such as prevention of aggregate formation in the polishing composition, reduction of the number of micro particles (light point defect or LPD) in the polished surface, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">A preferable polymer B has a Mw of 1×10<sup>4 </sup>or larger, but smaller than 25×10<sup>4</sup>. A polymer B satisfying such a Mw is preferable from the standpoint of the ease of filtration and washing (ease of elimination from the polished surface) of the polishing composition containing the polymer B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As the polymer B, a nonionic polymer can be preferably used from the standpoint of the suitable adsorbability to the abrasive and a polishing object (work piece) and unlikelihood of causing the occurrence of aggregates or lowering of washability due to excessive adsorbability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">From the standpoint of improving the polishing work, a nitrogen atom-containing polymer (e.g. a polymer containing a pendant group (side chain) having an amide bond) can be preferably used as the polymer B. Preferable examples of the polymer B in the art disclosed herein include nitrogen atom-containing nonionic polymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">A polyvinyl alcohol is an example of a polymer that can be preferably used as the polymer A. The combined use of a polyvinyl alcohol and the polymer B as the water-soluble polymer may effectively improve the performance (e.g. reduction of the number of LPD, reduction of haze, etc.) of the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The polishing composition disclosed herein can be preferably made in an embodiment further comprising a basic compound, in addition to the abrasive, water-soluble polymer and water. According to the polishing composition in such an embodiment, the polishing efficiency can be increased by the effect of the basic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The polishing composition disclosed herein can be preferably used for polishing a silicon wafer. A polishing composition comprising the polymer A and the polymer B in combination can yield a higher-quality silicon wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">This specification also provides a method for producing a polished article (e.g. silicon wafer), using a polishing composition disclosed herein. The method comprises supplying a polishing liquid (the term “liquid” herein encompasses a slurry) to a polishing object (an article to be polished or a work piece). The method further comprises polishing a surface of the polishing object with the polishing liquid. According to such a production method, a high-quality polished article (e.g. a polished article with fewer LPD and low haze) can be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The art disclosed herein can be preferably applied to polishing a silicon wafer, for instance, a lapped silicon wafer. An example of particularly preferable applications is final polishing of a silicon wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0017">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below. Matters necessary to implement this invention other than those specifically referred to in this specification may be understood as design matters to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the conventional art in the pertinent field. The present invention can be implemented based on the contents disclosed in this specification and common technical knowledge in the subject field. In the present specification, the terms “weight” and “mass,” “% by weight” and “% by mass,” and “parts by weight” and “parts by mass” are used synonymously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">&lt;Abrasive&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The material and properties of the abrasive in the polishing composition disclosed herein are not particularly limited and can be suitably selected in accordance with the purpose and application of the polishing composition, etc. Examples of the abrasive include inorganic grains, organic grains and organic/inorganic composite grains. Specific examples of inorganic grains include oxide grains such as silica grains, alumina grains, cerium oxide grains, chromium oxide grains, titanium dioxide grains, zirconium oxide grains, magnesium oxide grains, manganese dioxide grains, zinc oxide grains, red oxide grains, etc.; nitride grains such as silicon nitride grains, boron nitride grains, etc.; carbide grains such as silicon carbide grains, boron carbide grains, etc.; diamond grains; carbonates such as calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, etc.; and the like. Specific examples of organic grains include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grains, poly(meth)acrylic acid grains (herein the (meth)acrylic acid comprehensively means acrylic acid and methacrylic acid), polyacrylonitrile grains, and the like. These abrasives can be used singly as one species or in a combination of two or more species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">As the abrasive, inorganic grains are preferable. In particular, grains of an oxide of a metal or metalloid are preferable. Preferable examples of the abrasive that can be used in the art disclosed herein include silica grains. For instance, the use of silica grains as the abrasive is particularly preferable when applying the art disclosed herein to a polishing composition that can be used for polishing a silicon wafer. This is because when the polished article is a silicon wafer, the use of silica grains formed of oxygen atoms and the same element as the polished article will not leave metal or metalloid residues that are not silicon after the polishing, eliminating risks such as contamination of the silicon wafer surface and degradation of electrical properties of the silicon wafer caused by dispersion of metal or metalloid residues that are not silicon in the polished article. An example of an embodiment of the polishing composition preferable from such a standpoint is a polishing composition consisting of silica grains as the abrasive. By nature, silica can be readily obtained in a highly pure state. This is also one of the reasons that silica grains are preferable as the abrasive. Specific examples of silica grains include colloidal silica, fumed silica, precipitated silica and the like. From the standpoint of the less likelihood of scratching the polishing object's surface and capability of making a surface with lower haze, colloidal silica and fumed silica are cited as preferable silica grains. Colloidal silica is particularly preferable. For instance, colloidal silica is preferably used as the abrasive in the polishing composition used for polishing (especially, final polishing) of a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The silica constituting the silica grains has a true specific gravity of preferably 1.5 or higher, more preferably 1.6 or higher, or yet more preferably 1.7 or higher. With increasing true specific gravity of the silica, the polishing rate (amount of surface removed from polishing object's surface per unit time) may increase when polishing a polishing object (e.g. silicon wafer). From the standpoint of reducing scratches occurring in the surface (polished surface) of the polishing object, preferable silica grains have a true specific gravity of 2.2 or lower. As the true specific gravity of the silica, the value measured by a liquid displacement method using ethanol as the displacing liquid can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the art disclosed herein, the abrasive in the polishing composition can be in a form of primary particles or in a form of secondary particles which are aggregates of primary particles. Alternatively, the abrasive may be present both in the primary particle form and secondary particle form. In a preferable embodiment, the abrasive is present at least partially in a secondary particle form in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of the polishing efficiency, etc., it is preferably 5 nm or larger, or more preferably 10 nm or larger. From the standpoint of obtaining greater effects of polishing (e.g. effects such as reduced haze, removal of defects, etc.), the average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>is preferably 15 nm or larger, or more preferably 20 nm or larger (e.g. larger than 20 nm). From the standpoint of the likelihood of yielding a highly smooth surface, the abrasive has an average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>of preferably 100 nm or smaller, more preferably 50 nm or smaller, or yet more preferably 40 nm or smaller. From the standpoint of the likelihood of obtaining a higher-quality surface (e.g. a surface with reduced defect such as LPD, PID (polishing induced defect), etc.), the art disclosed herein can also be preferably implemented in an embodiment using an abrasive having an average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>of 35 nm or smaller (more preferably 32 nm or smaller, e.g. smaller than 30 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the art disclosed herein, the abrasive's average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>can be determined, for instance, from the specific surface area S (m<sup>2</sup>/g) measured by the BET method, based on the equation for the average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>(nm)=2720/S. The abrasive's specific surface area can be measured by using, for instance, a surface area analyzer under trade name “FLOW SORB II 2300” available from Micromeritics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>of the abrasive is not particularly limited. From the standpoint of the polishing rate, etc., it is preferably 10 nm or larger, or more preferably 20 nm or larger. From the standpoint of obtaining greater effects of polishing, the average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>is preferably 30 nm or larger, more preferably 35 nm or larger, or yet more preferably 40 nm or larger (e.g. larger than 40 nm). From the standpoint of yielding a highly smooth surface, the abrasive has an average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>of suitably 200 nm or smaller, preferably 150 nm or smaller, or more preferably 100 nm or smaller. From the standpoint of the likelihood of obtaining a higher-quality surface (e.g. a surface with reduced defect such as LPD, PID, etc.), the art disclosed herein can also be preferably practiced in an embodiment using an abrasive having an average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>of smaller than 60 nm (more preferably 55 nm or smaller, e.g. smaller than 50 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The abrasive's average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>can be measured for an aqueous dispersion of the abrasive of interest as a measurement sample by dynamic light scattering using, for instance, model “UPA-UT151” available from Nikkiso Co., Ltd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The abrasive's average secondary particle diameter D<sub>P2 </sub>is generally equal to or larger than the abrasive's average primary particle diameter D<sub>P1 </sub>(D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>≧1) and is typically larger than D<sub>P1 </sub>(D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1</sub>≧1). Although not particularly limited, from the standpoint of the effects of polishing and post-polishing surface smoothness, D<sub>P2</sub>/D<sub>P1 </sub>of the abrasive is usually suitably in a range of 1.2 to 3, preferably in a range of 1.5 to 2.5, or more preferably in a range of 1.7 to 2.3 (e.g. greater than 1.9, but 2.2 or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The abrasive grain's shape (external shape) may be a globular shape or a non-globular shape. Specific examples of non-globular shapes of the abrasive include a peanut shape (i.e. peanut shell shape), cocoon shape, confeito shape (spiky ball shape), rugby ball shape, and so on. For instance, the abrasive mostly comprising peanut-shaped grains can be preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Although not particularly limited, the abrasive has an average value of primary particle's major axis to minor axis ratio (average aspect ratio) of preferably 1.0 or higher, more preferably 1.05 or higher, or yet more preferably 1.1 or higher. With increasing average aspect ratio of the abrasive, a higher polishing rate can be obtained. From the standpoint of scratch reduction and so on, the abrasive's average aspect ratio is preferably 3.0 or lower, more preferably 2.0 or lower, or yet more preferably 1.5 or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The abrasive's shape (external shape) and average aspect ratio can be assessed, for instance by electron microscope observations. In specific procedures for determining the average aspect ratio, for instance, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), with respect to a prescribed number (e.g. 200) of abrasive grains having observable separate shapes, the smallest circumscribing rectangles are drawn on the respective grain images. With respect to the rectangle drawn on each grain image, the long side length (major axis length) is divided by the short side length (minor axis length) to determine the major axis/minor axis ratio (aspect ratio). The aspect ratios of the prescribed number of grains can be arithmetically averaged to determine the average aspect ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0019" num="0000">&lt;Water-Soluble Polymer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The polishing composition disclosed herein comprises a water-soluble polymer. The type of water-soluble polymer is not particularly limited. A suitable species can be selected from water-soluble polymers known in the field of polishing compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The water-soluble polymer may have at least one species of functional group in the molecule, selected from cationic groups, anionic groups and nonionic groups. In the molecule, the water-soluble polymer may have, for instance, a hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, acryloxy group, sulfo group, amide structure, quaternary nitrogen structure, heterocyclic structure, vinyl structure, polyoxyalkylene structure, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Examples of water-soluble polymers that can be preferably used in the polishing composition disclosed herein include vinyl alcohol-based polymers such as a polyvinyl alcohol, a derivative thereof, etc.; oxyalkylene unit-containing polymers; nitrogen atom-containing polymers; and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The vinyl alcohol-based polymer is typically a polymer (PVA) comprising a vinyl alcohol unit (VA unit) as the primary repeating unit. In this polymer, the molar ratio of VA units to all the repeating units is usually 50% or higher, preferably 65% or higher, or more preferably 70% or higher, for instance, 75% or higher. All the repeating units may be essentially formed of VA units. In these vinyl alcohol-based polymers, the types of repeating unit other than the VA unit are not particularly limited. Examples may include vinyl acetate unit, vinyl propionate unit, vinyl hexanoate unit, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">When a vinyl alcohol-based polymer (PVA) is used as the water-soluble polymer, it has a degree of saponification of usually 50% by mole or higher, typically 65% by mole or higher, or preferably 75% by mole or higher, for instance, 80% by mole or higher. In a preferable embodiment, the degree of saponification of PVA is 90% by mole or higher. From the standpoint of the consistency of performance of the polishing composition, a PVA having a degree of saponification of 95% by mole or higher (typically higher than 95% by mole, e.g. higher than 98% by mole) is particularly preferable. The degree of saponification of PVA is theoretically 100% by mole or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">As the PVA, it is preferable to use a species with low metal ion content. A PVA with low metal ion content can be obtained by a method where the PVA is produced using starting materials with low metal ion contents, by a method where the produced PVA is ion-exchanged, and so on. Among metal ions, a PVA with low content of alkali metal ions is preferable. A PVA essentially free of sodium ions is particularly preferable. The use of such a PVA is advantageous also from the standpoint of reducing defect in the polished surface. For instance, can be preferably used a PVA whose sodium ion content is reduced to a level approximately equivalent to a sodium ion concentration of 10 ppb or lower in the polishing liquid (working slurry) described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The oxyalkylene unit-containing polymer may comprise one, two or more species of oxyalkylene unit with 2 to 6 carbon atoms (typically, a structural unit represented by —C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O— wherein n is an integer between 2 and 6).

For instance, all the components can be mixed at once or in a suitably selected order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Although not particularly limited, from the standpoint of consistently (reproducibly) producing polishing compositions having less aggregates, can be preferably used, for instance, a production method comprising obtaining a dispersion comprising an abrasive (e.g. silica grains), a basic compound and water (or a “basic abrasive dispersion” hereinafter) and mixing the basic abrasive dispersion and a water-soluble polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In such a basic abrasive dispersion containing both the abrasive and basic compound, the abrasive exhibits greater electrostatic repulsion due to the basic compound and thus shows higher dispersion stability than an abrasive dispersion free of a basic compound (which is typically almost neutral). Accordingly, local aggregation of the abrasive is less likely to occur as compared with an embodiment where the basic compound is added after addition of the water-soluble polymer to a neutral abrasive dispersion and an embodiment where the neutral abrasive dispersion, water-soluble polymer and basic compound are mixed all at once. This is preferable from the standpoint of increasing the ease of filtration of the polishing composition or reducing defects in the polished surface, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The water-soluble polymer is preferably pre-dissolved in water and mixed in the form of an aqueous solution (or “aqueous polymer solution” hereinafter) with the basic abrasive dispersion. This can better inhibit local aggregation of the abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">When mixing the basic abrasive dispersion and aqueous polymer solution, it is preferable to add the aqueous polymer solution to the basic abrasive dispersion. According to such a mixing method, local aggregation of the abrasive can be better prevented, for instance, as compared with a mixing method where the basic abrasive dispersion is added to the aqueous polymer solution. When the abrasive is silica grains (e.g. colloidal silica grains), it is particularly meaningful to use the mixing method by which an aqueous polymer solution is added to a basic abrasive dispersion as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Among the abrasive, water-soluble polymer, basic compound and water forming the polishing composition to be produced, the basic abrasive dispersion comprises at least some of the abrasive, at least some of the basic compound and at least some of the water. For instance, in a preferable embodiment, the abrasive dispersion comprises all the abrasive forming the polishing composition, at least some of the basic compound and at least some of the water.</div>

With increasing basic compound content, there is a tendency for greater inhibition of the occurrence of local aggregation during preparation of the polishing composition. The basic compound content in the basic abrasive dispersion is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 5% by mass or less, or yet more preferably 3% by mass or less. A lower basic compound content facilitates adjustment of the basic compound content in the polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The basic abrasive dispersion has a pH of preferably 8 or higher, or more preferably 9 or higher. With increasing pH, there is a tendency for greater inhibition of the occurrence of local aggregation when the water-soluble polymer or an aqueous solution thereof is added to the basic abrasive dispersion. The pH of the basic abrasive dispersion is preferably 12 or lower, more preferably 11.5 or lower, or yet more preferably 10.5 or lower. With the pH of the basic abrasive dispersion being lower in the basic range, the amount of the basic compound required for preparing the dispersion is reduced, making it easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition. For instance, when the abrasive is silica grains, it is advantageous that the pH is not excessively high also from the standpoint of reducing dissolution of the silica. The mixture's pH can be adjusted by modifying the amount of the basic compound added, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Such a basic abrasive dispersion can be prepared by mixing an abrasive, a basic compound and water. They can be mixed with a commonly known mixing device such as a propeller stirrer, ultrasonic disperser, homo mixer, etc. The mode of mixing the respective components of the basic abrasive dispersion is not particularly limited. For instance, the components can be mixed all at once or in a suitably selected order. An example of preferable embodiments is an embodiment where an approximately neutral dispersion comprising the abrasive and water is mixed with the basic compound or an aqueous solution thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">When mixing the water-soluble polymer in a form of an aqueous solution (aqueous polymer solution) into a basic abrasive dispersion, the water-soluble polymer content in the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 0.02% by mass or greater, more preferably 0.05% by mass or greater, or yet more preferably 0.1% by mass or greater.

The water-soluble polymer content in the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 5% by mass or less, or yet more preferably 3% by mass or less. With decreasing water-soluble polymer content, local aggregation of the abrasive tends to be more likely reduced when mixing the aqueous polymer solution with the basic abrasive dispersion.</div>

The pH of the aqueous polymer solution is adjusted preferably to around neutral to basic, or more preferably to basic. More specifically, the pH of the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 8 or higher, or more preferably 9 or higher. The pH can be adjusted by using some of the basic compound forming the polishing composition. The increased pH of the aqueous polymer solution can more greatly reduce local aggregation of the abrasive when the aqueous polymer solution is added to the basic abrasive dispersion. The pH of the aqueous polymer solution is preferably 12 or lower, or more preferably 10.5 or lower. When the pH of the aqueous polymer solution is lower in the basic range, the amount of the basic compound required for preparing the aqueous polymer solution is reduced, making it easier to adjust the basic compound content in the polishing composition. For instance, when the abrasive is silica grains, it is advantageous that the pH is not excessively high also from the standpoint of reducing dissolution of the silica.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The polishing composition disclosed herein can be preferably used for polishing a polishing object, for instance, in an embodiment comprising the following operations. Described below is a preferable embodiment of the method for polishing a polishing object using the polishing composition disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In particular, a polishing liquid (which is typically a slurry polishing liquid and sometimes called a polishing slurry) is obtained, comprising a polishing composition disclosed herein. The obtaining the polishing liquid may include, as described earlier, preparing the polishing liquid by subjecting the polishing composition to operations such as concentration adjustment (e.g. dilution), pH adjustment, etc. Alternatively, the polishing composition can be used straight as the polishing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Subsequently, the polishing slurry is supplied to a polishing object and polishing is carried out by a conventional method. For instance, when carrying out final polishing of a silicon wafer, the silicon wafer after a lapping step and first polishing step is set in a general polishing machine and via a polishing pad in the polishing machine, the polishing slurry is supplied to the surface (surface to be polished) of the silicon wafer. Typically, while the polishing slurry is continuously supplied, the polishing pad is pushed against the surface of the silicon wafer, and the two are moved (e.g. moved in circular motion) in coordination. Via such a polishing step, polishing of the polishing object is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">A polishing step such as the above may be part of production processes of polished articles (e.g. substrates such as silicon wafers, etc.).
