<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a polished object and a polishing composition kit.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">For example, a metal and a semiconductor such as silicon, aluminum, nickel, tungsten, copper, tantalum, titanium, or stainless steel, and an alloy thereof; a glassy substance such as quartz glass, aluminosilicate glass, or glassy carbon; a ceramic material such as alumina, silica, sapphire, silicon nitride, tantalum nitride, or titanium carbide; a compound semiconductor wafer material such as silicon carbide, gallium nitride, or gallium arsenide; and a resin material such as a polyimide resin are polished according to various requests such as flattening, and are applied in various fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">Above all, in order to produce a semiconductor device such as an integrated circuit, various studies on a technique for polishing a silicon wafer have been performed to produce a mirror wafer having a high-quality flat mirror surface without scratches or impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">A polishing step of a semiconductor wafer such as a silicon wafer may be performed by at least two stages of preliminary polishing and final polishing. In the preliminary polishing, rough polishing is performed in order to flatten a surface or improve surface roughness. The final polishing is performed in order to improve haze (cloudiness) or remove polishing defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">In such multi-stage polishing, Patent Literature 1 focuses on the following point. That is, when a subsequent polishing step is performed while abrasive grains in a polishing composition used in a preceding polishing step remain on a wafer surface after completion of polishing, in the subsequent polishing step, defects caused by polishing, such as scratches, are generated on the wafer surface due to the remaining abrasive grains. Patent Literature 1 discloses a polishing composition in which (1) the particle diameter of abrasive grains included (polishing abrasive grains before a final step) is equal to or more than that of abrasive grains in a polishing composition used in a polishing step two stages before the final step (polishing abrasive grains two stages before final step) and (2) the concentration of the polishing abrasive grains before the final step is equal to or less than that of polishing abrasive grains two stages before the final step in a polishing composition used in the polishing step two stages before the final step. Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique to obtain a semiconductor wafer having a high quality of surface, which can be adapted to a highly integrated device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">Haze generated on the surface of the semiconductor wafer during wafer processing not only affects electrical characteristics and a yield of the semiconductor device but also reduces a detection limit when particles adhering to the wafer surface are measured by a particle counter. A haze level of the surface of the semiconductor wafer obtained by a producing method by precisely polishing the surface using a conventional polishing composition is becoming insufficient because in the present, the quality required for the semiconductor wafer is becoming more severe due to the high performance and high integration density of the semiconductor device. According to more detailed semiconductor device design rules, similarly, LLS (Localized Light Scatters) which are a kind of defects observed on the wafer surface after polishing is performed using a polishing composition, are required to have a higher quality because the LLS affect the performance of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">In this point, even when polishing is performed using the polishing method disclosed in Patent Literature 1, an amount of haze cannot be reduced, and defects cannot be removed sufficiently.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0016">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described. The present invention is not limited only to the following embodiments. The dimension ratio of the drawings is exaggerated for convenience of explanation, and may be different from the actual ratio. Here, “X to Y” indicating a range means “X or more and Y or less.” “Weight” and “mass”, “% by weight” and “% by mass”, and “part by weight” and “part by mass” are regarded as the synonyms. Unless otherwise specified, operations and measurement of physical properties or the like are performed under the conditions of room temperature (20 to 25° C.)/relative humidity of 40 to 50%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0017">A first aspect of the present invention is a method for producing a polished object, which includes a double-side polishing step in which an object to be polished is subjected to double-side polishing using a double-side polishing composition including first abrasive grains having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm or more and a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer to obtain a double-side polished object, and a single-side polishing step in which the double-side polished object is subjected to single-side polishing using a single-side polishing composition including second abrasive grains having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm or less and a water-soluble polymer, and in which a ratio of an average primary particle diameter (A) of the first abrasive grains with respect to an average primary particle diameter (B) of the second abrasive grains (A)/(B) is more than 1 and 2.5 or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0018">As described above, focusing on a composition between a double-side polishing composition used in double-side polishing and a single-side polishing composition used in single-side polishing, the present inventors have made the particle diameter of abrasive grains used in double-side polishing relatively large, have set a minimum particle diameter of the abrasive grains used in double-side polishing and a maximum particle diameter of the abrasive grains used in single-side polishing, and have made the particle diameter of the abrasive grains used in double-side polishing not uselessly larger than the particle diameter of the abrasive grains used in single-side polishing. Furthermore, in particular, by using a specific polymer in double-side polishing, the present inventors have found that it is possible to remarkably reduce a haze level of a surface of an object to be polished while defects can be significantly reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0019">The object to be polished used in a producing method of the first aspect of the present invention is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include a metal and a semiconductor wafer such as silicon, aluminum, nickel, tungsten, copper, tantalum, titanium, or stainless steel, and an alloy thereof; a glassy substance such as quartz glass, aluminosilicate glass, or glassy carbon; a ceramic material such as alumina, silica, sapphire, silicon nitride, tantalum nitride, or titanium carbide; a compound semiconductor wafer material such as silicon carbide, gallium nitride, or gallium arsenide; and a resin material such as a polyimide resin. The shape of the object to be polished is not particularly limited, either. For example, the producing method can be preferably applied to polishing an object to be polished, having a flat surface such as plate-shape, polyhedron shape. By polishing such an object to be polished, it is possible to produce a polished object which can remarkably reduce a haze level while defects are significantly reduced. Among these objects to be polished, the object to be polished may include a plurality of materials. Above all, the object to be polished is preferably a semiconductor wafer. The producing method of the first aspect of the present invention is particularly preferable for polishing an object to be polished having a surface formed of single crystal or polycrystalline silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0020">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention in which the object to be polished is a silicon wafer will be described mainly. Of course, the object to be polished is not limited to a silicon wafer. The above-described examples can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0021">The silicon wafer used in the producing method of the first aspect of the present invention may be p-type or n-type. The crystal orientation of the silicon wafer is not particularly limited, and may be any one of &lt;100&gt;, &lt;110&gt;, and &lt;111&gt;. Resistivity of the silicon wafer is not particularly limited. The thickness of the silicon wafer is, for example, 600 to 1000 μm, but is not particularly limited. The producing method of the first aspect of the present invention can be applied to a wafer having any diameter such as 200 mm, 300 mm, or 450 mm. Particularly, the producing method of the first aspect of the present invention essentially includes a double-side polishing step, and therefore can be applied to a wafer having a large diameter such as 300 mm or 450 mm. Of course, a wafer having a diameter other than these diameters may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0022">Subsequently, a processing process of the silicon wafer will be described. A silicon single crystal ingot is sliced, and a silicon wafer is produced (slicing step). Thereafter, edges of the silicon wafer are bevelled (beveling step). Then, a wafer surface is roughly polished by lapping and adjusted into a predetermined shape (lapping step). Furthermore, the surface layer of the silicon wafer which has changed in quality due to lapping is removed (the processing quality-changed layer of the wafer is removed), and the silicon wafer is etched (etching process). After etching, the edges and the surface (double-side or single-side) of the silicon wafer are polished (polishing step), and then the silicon wafer is cleaned (cleaning step). The silicon wafer may be rinsed (rinsing step) between the polishing steps or between the polishing step and the cleaning step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0023">The producing method of the first aspect of the present invention is characterized in producing a polished object produced in the polishing step among the series of processes. In the polishing step of the present embodiment, the surface (double-side or single-side) of the silicon wafer is bought into contact with a polishing pad, and the wafer surface and the polishing pad are relatively slided while a polishing composition (double-side polishing composition or single-side polishing composition) is supplied to the contact portion. The wafer surface is thereby polished. In a preferable embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the double-side polishing step is a rough polishing step (preliminary polishing step), and the single-side polishing step is a final polishing step. In the preferable embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the double-side polishing step is performed once and the single-side polishing step is performed once (first embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, described in detail below). In the preferable embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the double-side polishing step is performed once and the single-side polishing step is performed twice (second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, described in detail below). As a modification example of the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the double-side polishing step is performed multiple times, and the single-side polishing step is performed three or more times. In the preferable embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the silicon wafer is rinsed whenever each step is finished (that is, after the double-side polishing step, after the single-side polishing step, after each step when the single-side polishing step is performed multiple times, or after each step when the double-side polishing step is performed multiple times) in order to switch polishing compositions, remove polishing waste, or protect the wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0024">Subsequently, a polishing apparatus will be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a single-side polishing apparatus used in polishing using a single-side polishing composition. This single-side polishing apparatus may be used in the rinsing step using a rinsing composition. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a single-side polishing apparatus <b>11</b> includes a disc-shaped rotary plate <b>12</b> to the top surface of which a polishing pad <b>14</b> is stuck. The rotary plate <b>12</b> is provided so as to be integrally rotatable with respect to a first shaft <b>13</b> rotating in an arrow <b>13</b> <i>a </i>direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At least one wafer holder <b>15</b> is provided above the rotary plate <b>12</b>. The wafer holder <b>15</b> is provided so as to be integrally rotatable with respect to a second shaft <b>16</b> rotating in an arrow <b>16</b> <i>a </i>direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A wafer holding plate <b>19</b> having a wafer holding hole <b>18</b> is detachably attached to the bottom surface of the wafer holder <b>15</b> via a ceramic plate <b>17</b> and a urethane sheet (not illustrated). The single-side polishing apparatus <b>11</b> may further include a polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> and a rinsing composition feeder (not illustrated). The polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> may discharge a single-side polishing composition through a nozzle <b>21</b> <i>a</i>. The rinsing composition feeder (not illustrated) may discharge a rinsing composition through a nozzle (not illustrated). The polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> of the single-side polishing apparatus <b>11</b> not including a rinsing composition feeder (not illustrated) or a nozzle may discharge a rinsing composition through the nozzle <b>21</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0025">When a silicon wafer is polished, the polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> is disposed above the rotary plate <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A silicon wafer to be polished is sucked into the wafer holding hole <b>18</b> and is held in the wafer holder <b>15</b>. First, the wafer holder <b>15</b> and the rotary plate <b>12</b> start to rotate, and a single-side polishing composition is discharged from the polishing composition feeder <b>21</b>, and the single-side polishing composition is supplied onto the polishing pad <b>14</b>. Then, the wafer holder <b>15</b> is moved toward the rotary plate <b>12</b> (also referred to as a lower plate <b>23</b> in a double-side polishing apparatus <b>22</b> described below) in order to press the silicon wafer onto the polishing pad <b>14</b>. One side of the silicon wafer in contact with the polishing pad <b>14</b> is thereby polished. The polishing pad is not particularly limited, and a polyurethane type, a nonwoven fabric type, a suede type, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0026">By including another disc-shaped rotary plate to which a polishing pad is stuck, the single-side polishing apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used as a double-side polishing apparatus for polishing both sides of the silicon wafer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an embodiment of a double-side polishing apparatus used in polishing using a double-side polishing composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0027">In an embodiment of a double-side polishing apparatus of the first aspect of the present invention, a disc-shaped rotary plate to which a polishing pad is stuck is further disposed above to be used as an upper rotary plate (upper plate <b>24</b>) to which a polishing pad <b>14</b> is stuck. The silicon wafer held by the wafer holding hole <b>18</b> is held by the polishing pad <b>14</b> stuck to the lower plate <b>23</b> and the polishing pad <b>14</b> stuck to the upper plate <b>24</b>. The upper rotary plate includes a flowing hole for a double-side polishing composition (polishing composition feeding gutter <b>26</b>) to make a double-side polishing composition discharged from the polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> flow out in a lower part. The upper rotary plate (upper plate <b>24</b>) and the lower rotary plate (lower plate <b>23</b>) rotate in opposite directions as illustrated in arrows <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. A double-side polishing composition is discharged from the double-side polishing composition feeder <b>21</b>, and the both polishing pads <b>14</b> rotate while pressing both sides of the silicon wafer. The both sides of the silicon wafer are thereby polished. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the double-side polishing apparatus <b>22</b>, the wafer holder <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not necessary. In place of the wafer holder <b>15</b>, a wafer holding plate having one wafer holding hole <b>18</b> is necessary. These are referred to as a wafer holder or a processing carrier <b>25</b> as a whole. According to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one holding plate includes one wafer, and three holding plates are disposed. However, according to another embodiment, one holding plate may include three wafers. In the present invention, any apparatus can be used. The number of the holding plate or the number of the wafer held by one holding plate is not particularly limited. A conventionally known apparatus can be used as it is or by appropriately improving the conventionally known apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0028">A rotation speed can be selected appropriately. However, in double-side polishing, the rotation speed is usually about 10 to 50 rpm, and preferably about 15 to 30 rpm. In this case, the rotation speeds of the upper rotary plate and the lower rotary plate may be different from each other, but are usually set to the same relative speed with respect to the wafer. In single-side polishing, the rotation speed is usually about 10 to 100 rpm, and preferably about 20 to 50 rpm. With such a rotational speed, it is possible to remarkably reduce the haze level of the surface of the silicon wafer (double-side or single-side). In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce defects, to lower a laser marking height, and to improve a numerical value of ESFQR. As described above, the silicon wafer is usually pressurized by the plate. In this case, the pressure can be selected appropriately. However, in double-side polishing, the pressure is usually preferably about 5 to 25 kPa, more preferably about 10 to 15 kPa. In single-side polishing, the pressure is usually preferably about 5 to 25 kPa, more preferably about 10 to 15 kPa. With such a pressure, it is possible to remarkably reduce the haze level of the surface of the silicon wafer. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce defects, to lower a laser marking height, and to improve a numerical value of ESFQR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0029">A feeding speed of a polishing composition (double-side polishing composition or single-side polishing composition) can be selected appropriately according to the size of the plate. However, in view of the economic efficiency, in double-side polishing, the feeding speed of a double-side polishing composition is usually preferably about 1 to 10 L/min, and more preferably about 2 to 5 L/min. In single-side polishing, the feeding speed of a single-side polishing composition is usually preferably about 0.1 to 5 L/min, preferably about 0.5 to 2 L/min. With such a feeding speed, it is possible to polish the surface of the silicon wafer efficiently and to remarkably reduce the haze level of the surface of the silicon wafer. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce defects, to lower a laser marking height, and to improve a numerical value of ESFQR. The holding temperature in a polishing apparatus of a polishing composition (double-side polishing composition or single-side polishing composition) is not particularly limited. However, the holding temperature is usually preferably about 15 to 40° C., more preferably about 18 to 25° C. from viewpoints of stability of the polishing speed and reduction in the haze level. The above-described polishing conditions are only examples. The polishing conditions may be outside the above-described range, or the settings may be changed appropriately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0030">When a polished silicon wafer is rinsed, a rinsing composition feeder is disposed above the rotary plate <b>12</b> in place of the polishing composition feeder <b>21</b>. A polishing composition in the polishing composition feeder <b>21</b> may be discharged, and a rinsing composition may be put thereinto in place of the polishing composition. After operation conditions of the single-side polishing apparatus <b>11</b> are switched from the settings for polishing to the settings for rinsing, a rinsing composition is discharged from the rinsing composition feeder and fed onto the polishing pad <b>14</b>. The surface of the silicon wafer in contact with the polishing pad <b>14</b> is thereby rinsed. In the rinsing step, a polishing composition to be used in a subsequent step may be used as a rinsing composition as it is, or a composition obtained by removing abrasive grains from the polishing composition to be used in the subsequent step may be used as a rinsing composition. When a polishing composition is used as a rinsing composition, components of the polishing composition may be increased or reduced, or may be diluted with water if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0031">Hereinafter, the first aspect of the present invention will be described by dividing the first aspect into several embodiments.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">First Embodiment of the First Aspect of the Present Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0032">In the first embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, a double-side polishing step in which a silicon wafer is subjected to double-side polishing using a double-side polishing composition to obtain a double-side polished silicon wafer is performed once, and a single-side polishing step in which the double-side polished silicon wafer is subjected to single-side polishing using a single-side polishing composition is performed once. Performing each step once is preferable from viewpoints of efficient polishing, reduction in cost, and a wastewater treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">[Abrasive Grains]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0033">Abrasive grains polish a surface of an object to be polished mechanically. Specific examples of the abrasive grains include particles made of a metal oxide such as silica, alumina, ceria, zirconia, or titania, and particles made of silicon carbide, calcium carbonate, or diamond. One kind of these compounds may be used alone or a combination of two or more kinds thereof may be used. Among the abrasive grains, silica particles are preferable. Examples thereof include colloidal silica and fumed silica. The kind of the first abrasive grains and the kind of the second abrasive grains may be the same as or different from each other, but are preferably the same from a viewpoint of cross contamination (a previous step influences a subsequent step). When the kind of the first abrasive grains is different from that of the second abrasive grains, abrasive grains may be combined appropriately to be used. Colloidal silica is preferable among the silica particles. When colloidal silica or fumed silica is used, particularly when colloidal silica is used, scratches generated on a surface of an object to be polished in a polishing step are to be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0034">The content of the first abrasive grains in a double-side polishing composition is preferably 0.1% by mass or more, more preferably 0.2% by mass or more. The content of the second abrasive grains in a single-side polishing composition is preferably 0.05% by mass or more, more preferably 0.1% by mass or more. Increase in the content of the abrasive grains improves surface processing performance with respect to a surface to be polished, such as a polishing speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0035">The content of the first abrasive grains in a double-side polishing composition is preferably 50% by mass or less, more preferably 45% by mass or less. The content of the second abrasive grains in a single-side polishing composition is preferably 20% by mass or less, more preferably 15% by mass or less. By reduction in the content of the abrasive grains, there is a tendency that dispersion stability of the polishing composition is improved and a residue of the abrasive grains on the polished surface is reduced. The lower limit of the content is particularly based on an assumption of a concentration in a form of dilution described below. The upper limit of the content is particularly based on an assumption of a concentration in a concentrated liquid described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0036">The average primary particle diameter (A) of the first abrasive grains used in the double-side polishing composition is not particularly limited as long as the diameter is 40 nm or more. The diameter may be more than 40 nm, 45 nm or more or less, 50 nm or more or less, 53 nm or more or less, 55 nm or more or less, 60 nm or more or less, 65 nm or more or less, 70 nm or more or less, 80 nm or more or less, 85 nm or more or less, 90 nm or more or less, or 92 nm or more or less.

The laser marking is for marking ID or the like in a silicon wafer, and is represented by forming recesses (dots) by irradiating an outer peripheral portion of the silicon wafer with a laser beam and arranging the dots. The laser marking is mainly attached to a portion corresponding to a back surface outer peripheral portion of the silicon wafer. In a case of polishing with a double-side polishing machine, only the parts around the laser marking have a smaller polishing amount as compared to a part having no laser marking because silicon is changed in quality, and therefore a projection is easily generated disadvantageously.

The content of the chelating agent in the polishing composition (double-side polishing composition or single-side polishing composition) is preferably 0.5% by mass or less, more preferably 0.1% by mass or less. Decrease in the content of the chelating agent further maintains storage stability of a polishing composition.

The above-described polishing composition (double-side polishing composition or single-side polishing composition) may be used for polishing as it is. Alternatively, a polishing composition may be prepared and used for polishing by diluting a concentrated liquid of the polishing composition with water or by diluting a multi-component type polishing composition with an aqueous solution containing water and some components.

<heading id="h-0021">Second Embodiment of the First Aspect of the Present Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0099">The second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention includes a double-side polishing step in which a silicon wafer is subjected to double-side polishing using a double-side polishing composition to obtain a double-side polished silicon wafer, and a single-side polishing step in which the double-side polished silicon wafer is subjected to single-side polishing using a single-side polishing composition. The single-side polishing step is performed twice. Performing the single-side polishing step twice is preferable from a viewpoint of productivity. Of the two single-side polishing steps, the first polishing is also referred to as “single-side polishing at a first stage, and the subsequent polishing is also referred to as “single-side polishing at a second stage.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0100">A difference between the first embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention and the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention is the number of the single-side polishing step. The description of the first embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention is basically applied to other parts in the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention. As a modification example of the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the double-side polishing step may be performed two or more times, and the single-side polishing step may be performed three or more times. The upper limit of the number of the double-side polishing step is about three. The upper limit of the number of the single-side polishing step is about six.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0101">In the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, in the single-side polishing step at a first stage and the single-side polishing step at a second stage, single-side polishing is performed. Therefore, the second abrasive grains are used in both the steps. These second abrasive grains may have different particle diameters or the same particle diameter as long as the second abrasive grains have an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm or less and (A)/(B) is more than 1 and 2.5 or less. However, the second abrasive grains having the same particle diameter are preferably used from a viewpoint of workability. When the second abrasive grains having different particle diameters are used, the second abrasive grains used in single-side polishing at the second stage are preferably smaller than those used in single-side polishing at the first stage. The ratio thereof is preferably about 0.9 to 0.5 or about 0.8 to 0.7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0102">In the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the single-side polishing step is performed twice, and therefore the single-side polishing step at the second stage is the last single-side polishing step. A water-soluble polymer used in the last single-side polishing step preferably includes at least one selected from a polymer containing an oxyalkylene unit, a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer, polyvinyl alcohol, and a cellulose derivative, and particularly preferably includes a cellulose derivative. In this way, by using a cellulose derivative in the last single-side polishing step, the number of LLS is particularly reduced, the haze (relative value) is particularly reduced, the above-described minimum polishing amount is particularly small, and the polishing speed is high. This is similarly applied to a case where the single-side polishing step is performed three times or more. When the single-side polishing step is performed three times, by using a cellulose derivative in a single-side polishing step at a third stage, a similar effect can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">&lt;Second Aspect of the Present Invention&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0103">A second aspect of the present invention is a polishing composition kit which includes first abrasive grains having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm or more, used in double-side polishing, a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer used in double-side polishing, second abrasive grains having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm or less, used in single-side polishing, and a water-soluble polymer used in single-side polishing, and in which a ratio of an average primary particle diameter (A) of the first abrasive grains with respect to an average primary particle diameter (B) of the second abrasive grains (A)/(B) is more than 1 and 2.5 or less. By performing double-side polishing and single-side polishing using the polishing composition kit of the second aspect of the present invention, an effect similar to the first aspect of the present invention can be obtained. The description of the first aspect of the present invention is similarly applied to the first abrasive grains, the nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer, the second abrasive grains, the water-soluble polymer, and the ratio of the average primary particle diameter (A) of the first abrasive grains with respect to the average primary particle diameter (B) of the second abrasive grains (A)/(B). Therefore, description thereof will be omitted here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0104">A form of the polishing composition kit is not particularly limited. A double-side polishing composition in which first abrasive grains and a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer are mixed in advance and a single-side polishing composition in which second abrasive grains and a water-soluble polymer are mixed in advance are stored in separate containers, and may be packed together or separately. The double-side polishing composition and the single-side polishing composition do not have to be packed. Even when the double-side polishing composition and the single-side polishing composition are placed on a shelf or the like in order to be used in double-side polishing and single-side polishing, respectively, these compositions are regarded as the polishing composition kit of the present invention. Alternatively, even when first abrasive grains used in double-side polishing, a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer used in double-side polishing, second abrasive grains used in single-side polishing, and a water-soluble polymer used in single-side polishing are stored in separate containers without being mixed in advance, these are regarded as the polishing composition kit of the present invention. As in the second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, similarly also when there are two kinds of single-side polishing compositions, even when two single-side polishing compositions in which second abrasive grains and a water-soluble polymer are mixed in advance are prepared, these compositions are regarded as the polishing composition kit of the present invention. Even when second abrasive grains and a water-soluble polymer are stored in separate containers, these are regarded as the polishing composition kit of the present invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0132">Examples 1 to 26, generally, it is possible to remarkably reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects. In addition, it is possible to lower the laser marking height and to improve a numerical value of ESFQR indicating local flatness of a wafer edge portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0133">On the other hand, in Comparative Examples 1 and 2, a double-side polishing composition does not include a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer, and therefore the number of LLS is very large. That is, it is not possible to reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0134">In Comparative Examples 3 to 5 and 11, both the haze level and the number of LLS are very poor. This is because the requirement that the average primary particle diameter of the second abrasive grains is 40 nm or less, is not satisfied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0135">In Comparative Example 6, a nitrogen-containing water-soluble polymer is not included, but HEC having high ability to impart wettability to a polished surface and excellent cleaning performance is used, and therefore the results are relatively good. However, the number of LLS is larger than that in Example 3 in which conditions other than this point are the same. It can be said from this viewpoint that it is not possible to reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects. Similarly, in Comparative Examples 7 and 12, (A)/(B) is 2.6. Therefore, the number of LLS is larger than those in Examples 10 and 26 in which conditions other than the particle diameter (B) are the same. It can be said from this viewpoint that it is not possible to reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects. In this point, an upper limit critical point of (A)/(B) can be suggested to be 2.5 or less. Comparative Example 9 is similarly discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0136">Also Comparative Example 8 does not satisfy the prescribed (A)/(B). Therefore, the number of LLS is larger than that in Example 7 in which conditions other than (A)/(B) are the same. It can be said from this viewpoint that it is not possible to reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0137">Also Comparative Example 10 does not satisfy the prescribed (A)/(B). Therefore, the number of LLS is larger than that in Example 1 in which conditions other than (A)/(B) are the same. It can be said from this viewpoint that it is not possible to reduce the haze level and to significantly reduce defects. In this point, a lower limit critical point of (A)/(B) can be suggested to more than 1.</div>
