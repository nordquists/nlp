<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a silicon carbide substrate, a semiconductor device, and methods for manufacturing them. More particularly, the present invention relates to a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of semiconductor device characteristics, a semiconductor device using the substrate, and methods for manufacturing them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, in order to achieve higher breakdown voltage and lower loss of a semiconductor device, use thereof in a high temperature environment, and the like, silicon carbide has increasingly been adopted as a material for forming a semiconductor device. Since silicon carbide is excellent in heat conductivity when compared with a semiconductor made of a nitride such as gallium nitride, it is excellent as a substrate for a semiconductor device for high-power application at high voltage and large current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to form a high-quality epitaxial layer on a substrate, the substrate may be subjected to surface treatment before formation of the epitaxial layer. For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2010-163307 describes a nitride substrate having a surface layer containing 3 atomic percent (at %) to 25 at % of carbon and 5×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 200×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>of a p type metal element. Thereby, a nitride substrate having a stabilized surface is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the state of a surface differs depending on the substrate material, resulting in differences in surface oxidation and easiness of adsorption or adherence of an impurity to the surface. Therefore, even if the method described in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2010-163307 is applied to a silicon carbide substrate, it is difficult to obtain a silicon carbide substrate having a stabilized surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made to solve such a problem, and one object of the present invention is to provide a silicon carbide substrate having a stabilized surface, a semiconductor device using the substrate, and methods for manufacturing them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventor of the present invention has studied the relationship between the state of a surface of a silicon carbide substrate and characteristics of a semiconductor device using the substrate. As a result, the inventor has found that the characteristics of the semiconductor device are influenced by the presence of an impurity element in a main surface of the silicon carbide substrate on which an epitaxial growth layer is to be formed. The inventor has also obtained a finding that the characteristics of the semiconductor device differ depending on the type of the impurity element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Specifically, when there are many impurities in the surface of the silicon carbide substrate, epitaxial growth is inhibited because lattice matching with the substrate is hindered. Further, when a native oxide film is formed on the surface of the silicon carbide substrate from oxygen in an atmosphere, the quality of an epitaxial layer grown by lattice matching with the substrate is deteriorated. In addition, silicon (Si) as an impurity from the atmosphere is likely to adhere to the surface of the silicon carbide substrate. When silicon is increased, a piled-up layer is formed at an interface between the silicon carbide substrate and the epitaxial layer, reducing a resistance at the interface. When the resistance at the interface is reduced, a current leaks toward the substrate, causing deterioration in the characteristics of the semiconductor device. In particular, the deterioration in the characteristics of the semiconductor device due to the leakage current is more significant in a lateral semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result of earnest study, the inventor has obtained the following findings. Due to the presence of certain amounts of sulfur atoms and carbon atoms as an impurity in the surface of the silicon carbide substrate, oxidation of the surface and an increase in impurities are suppressed, and thereby deterioration in the quality of the epitaxial layer formed on the surface can be suppressed. In addition, due to the presence of certain amounts of sulfur atoms and carbon atoms as an impurity in the surface of the silicon carbide substrate, silicon as an impurity is suppressed from adhering to the surface of the silicon carbide substrate. Thus, a reduction in the resistance at the interface between the silicon carbide substrate and the epitaxial layer can be suppressed. As a result, yield of a semiconductor device manufactured using the silicon carbide substrate can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, it has been found that, due to the presence of certain amounts of sulfur atoms and carbon atoms as an impurity in the surface of the silicon carbide substrate, the surface of the silicon carbide substrate is stabilized, and yield of a semiconductor device formed using the substrate can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">A silicon carbide substrate in accordance with the present invention has a first main surface, and a second main surface opposite to the first main surface. A region including at least one main surface of the first and second main surfaces is made of single-crystal silicon carbide. Sulfur atoms are present in the one main surface at not less than 60×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and not more than 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, and carbon atoms as an impurity are present in the one main surface at not less than 3 at % and not more than 25 at %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the silicon carbide substrate in accordance with the present invention, the presence ratio of the sulfur atoms in the one surface is not less than 60×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and not more than 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the presence ratio of the carbon atoms as the impurity in the one surface is not less than 3 at % and not more than 25 at %. Since the presence ratio of the sulfur atoms is not less than 60×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the presence ratio of the carbon atoms as the impurity is not less than 3 at %, the silicon carbide substrate has a stabilized surface. In addition, since the presence ratio of the sulfur atoms is not more than 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the presence ratio of the carbon atoms as the impurity is not more than 25 at %, inhibition of epitaxial growth due to hindered lattice matching with the substrate can be suppressed. As a result, a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of a semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">It is noted that the presence ratio of the sulfur atoms in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate can be measured for example by TXRF (Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence) or the like. Further, the presence ratio of the carbon atoms in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate can be measured by AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), or the like. In the measurement by these analysis methods, the presence ratio of an impurity element is measured based on information in a region from the main surface to a depth of about 5 nm. That is, in the present application, the presence ratio of an element in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate means the presence ratio of the element in a region from the main surface to a depth of about 5 nm. It is noted that, since XPS evaluates binding energy, it can separately evaluate carbon constituting silicon carbide and carbon contained in an organic substance and the like adhering to a surface, that is, carbon as an impurity. Specifically, by observing peak shift (chemical shift) in XPS spectra, carbon detected at about 281 to 283 eV is determined as carbon of Si—C, and carbon detected at about 284 to 293 eV is determined as carbon as an impurity adhering to a surface of a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The carbon atoms as the impurity refer to, for example, carbon atoms adhering to the silicon carbide substrate, as an impurity. In other words, the carbon atoms as the impurity refer to carbon atoms not having silicon carbide binding. Examples of the carbon atoms as the impurity include carbon atoms in a bound state such as C—C, C—H, C═C, C—OH, or O═C—OH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, chlorine atoms are present in the one main surface at not more than 3000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thereby, deterioration in the quality of an epitaxial growth layer can be suppressed. Further, the silicon carbide substrate has a stabilized surface. As a result, a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of a semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">It is noted that the presence ratio of the chlorine atoms in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate can be measured for example by TXRF or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, oxygen atoms are present in the one main surface at not less than 3 at % and not more than 30 at %. Since the presence ratio of the oxygen atoms is not less than 3 at %, the silicon carbide substrate has a stabilized surface. Further, since the presence ratio of the oxygen atoms is not more than 30 at %, deterioration in the quality of the epitaxial growth layer can be suppressed. As a result, a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of a semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that the presence ratio of the oxygen atoms in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate can be measured by AES, XPS, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, a metal impurity is present in the one main surface at not more than 4000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thereby, deterioration in the quality of the epitaxial growth layer can be suppressed. Further, the silicon carbide substrate has a stabilized surface. As a result, a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of a semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">It is noted that the presence ratio of the metal impurity in the main surface of the silicon carbide substrate can be measured for example by TXRF or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, the one main surface has a surface roughness of not more than 0.5 nm when evaluated in a root-mean-square roughness Rq (see the Japanese Industrial Standards: JIS). This allows easy formation of a good-quality epitaxial growth layer on the one main surface. As a result, a silicon carbide substrate capable of improving yield of a semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">It is noted that the surface roughness of the main surface can be measured for example with an AFM (Atomic Force Microscope), an optical interference-type roughness meter, a stylus-type roughness meter, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the silicon carbide substrate has a diameter of not less than 110 mm. In a process for manufacturing a semiconductor device using such a large-diameter substrate, manufacturing efficiency of the semiconductor device can be improved, and manufacturing cost thereof can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the silicon carbide substrate has a diameter of not less than 125 mm and not more than 300 mm. From the viewpoint of improving productivity, a large-area substrate having a diameter of approximately 125 mm or more is desired. If the substrate has a diameter of more than 300 mm, in-plane distribution of the surface impurities is increased. Further, advanced control is required to suppress warpage of the substrate. Thus, it is desirable that the silicon carbide substrate has a diameter of not more than 300 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, the single-crystal silicon carbide has a 4H structure. The one main surface has an off angle of not less than 0.1° and not more than 10° relative to a {0001} plane of the single-crystal silicon carbide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Silicon carbide having a 4H structure, which is hexagonal silicon carbide, can be efficiently grown by being grown in a &lt;0001&gt; direction. In addition, a substrate having a small off angle, specifically, an off angle of not more than 10°, relative to the {0001} plane can be efficiently fabricated from a crystal grown in the &lt;0001&gt; direction. On the other hand, good epitaxial growth is easily performed by providing the one main surface with an off angle of not less than 0.1° relative to the {0001} plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, in the silicon carbide substrate, the single-crystal silicon carbide has a 4H structure. The one main surface has an off angle of not more than 4° relative to a {03-38} plane of the single-crystal silicon carbide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Thereby, suppression of leakage current, improvement in channel mobility, and the like in a semiconductor device manufactured using the substrate are easily achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The silicon carbide substrate has a base layer, and a single-crystal silicon carbide layer formed on the base layer. The one main surface is a surface of the single-crystal silicon carbide layer on a side opposite to a side facing the base layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Thereby, a silicon carbide substrate can be manufactured relatively inexpensively for example by preparing an inexpensive base substrate, specifically, a substrate made of single-crystal silicon carbide having a high defect density, a polycrystalline silicon carbide substrate, or a base substrate made of ceramics, as a base layer, and arranging a substrate made of a good-quality silicon carbide single crystal on the base substrate. In particular, since it is difficult to obtain a large-diameter silicon carbide substrate, an inexpensive, large-diameter silicon carbide substrate can be obtained for example by arranging a plurality of single-crystal silicon carbide substrates which have good quality but are small in size on a base substrate, side by side when viewed in plan view, to fabricate a silicon carbide substrate having a plurality of single-crystal silicon carbide layers arranged side by side on a base layer along a main surface of the base layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">A semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention has a silicon carbide substrate, an epitaxial growth layer, and an electrode. The silicon carbide substrate has a first main surface, and a second main surface opposite to the first main surface.

The epitaxial growth layer is formed on the one main surface of the silicon carbide substrate. The electrode is formed on the epitaxial growth layer.</div>

In the step of performing finishing treatment on the surface of the substrate, presence ratios of sulfur atoms and carbon atoms as an impurity in the one main surface are adjusted such that the sulfur atoms are present in the one main surface at not less than 60×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and not more than 2000×10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the carbon atoms as the impurity are present in the one main surface at not less than 3 at % and not more than 25 at %.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">To evaluate the surface composition, the amount of sulfur atoms (S) was measured by TXRF, and the amount of carbon atoms (C) as an impurity was measured by XPS. Devices were produced using substrates (sample numbers 1-1 to 1-11) with controlled surface compositions. The produced devices were used to manufacture lateral MESFETs. Yields of the MESFETs were calculated. In the calculation of the yields, a MESFET having a gate current density of 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>A/cm<sup>2 </sup>when a gate voltage of 5 V was applied thereto was determined as good.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">An experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of a plane orientation of a main surface of a silicon carbide substrate on yield of a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">A silicon carbide single crystal was grown by the sublimation method. A silicon carbide substrate with a diameter of 80 mm was used as a seed substrate. The seed substrate had a main surface corresponding to the (0001) plane. A grown surface, an underlying substrate surface, and an outer periphery of the silicon carbide single crystal were ground with an outer periphery grinding machine to obtain an ingot of silicon carbide. Slicing was performed using a multiwire saw. In order to obtain a sliced substrate surface corresponding to {03-38}, the ingot was set in a wire saw apparatus with being tilted by 54.7° from a running direction of a wire, and was cut. A sliced substrate had a thickness of 250 μm. An outer periphery of the sliced substrate was diced to obtain tile substrates of 20 mm×30 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Polycrystalline silicon carbide was grown by the sublimation method. An ingot with a diameter of 155 mm was obtained by outer periphery processing. The ingot was sliced with a multiwire saw to obtain a polycrystalline substrate with a thickness of 500 μm. The rectangular single-crystal substrates were arranged on the polycrystalline underlying substrate, and bonded by close-spaced sublimation. An outer periphery of the bonded composite substrate was processed to obtain a substrate with a diameter of 150 mm and a thickness of 750 μm. In the present invention's example, x and y were adjusted to satisfy the condition of −50x+700≦y≦−50x+1100, where x represents a pH of slurry, and y represents an oxidation-reduction potential. Further, in the present invention's example, resistance coefficient R (m<sup>2</sup>/s) was set to 5.0×10<sup>−15 </sup>to 1.0×10<sup>−14 </sup>(m<sup>2</sup>/s).</div>
