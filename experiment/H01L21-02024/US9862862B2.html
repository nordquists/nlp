<heading id="h-0002">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the semiconductor industry, chemical mechanical polishing is a well-known technology applied in fabricating advanced photonic, microelectromechanical and microelectronic materials and devices, such as semiconductor wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">During the fabrication of materials and devices used in the semiconductor industry, CMP is employed to planarize surfaces. CMP utilizes the interplay of chemical and mechanical action to achieve the planarity of the to-be-polished surfaces. Chemical action is provided by a chemical composition, also referred to as CMP composition or CMP slurry. Mechanical action is usually carried out by a polishing pad which is typically pressed onto the to-be-polished surface and mounted on a moving platen. The movement of the platen is usually linear, rotational or orbital.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical CMP process step, a rotating wafer holder brings the to-be-polished wafer in contact with a polishing pad. The CMP composition is usually applied between the to-be-polished wafer and the polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In the state of the art, CMP processes in the presence of a CMP composition comprising surface modified silica particles are known and described, for instance, in the following references.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0080">The polishing process is generally known and can be carried out with the processes and the equipment under the conditions customarily used for the CMP in the fabrication of wafers with integrated circuits. There is no restriction on the equipment with which the polishing process can be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0081">As is known in the art, typical equipment for the CMP process consists of a rotating platen which is covered with a polishing pad. Also orbital polishers have been used. The wafer is mounted on a carrier or chuck. The side of the wafer being processed is facing the polishing pad (single side polishing process). A retaining ring secures the wafer in the horizontal position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0082">Below the carrier, the larger diameter platen is also generally horizontally positioned and presents a surface parallel to that of the wafer to be polished. The polishing pad on the platen contacts the wafer surface during the planarization process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0083">To produce material loss, the wafer is pressed onto the polishing pad. Both the carrier and the platen are usually caused to rotate around their respective shafts extending perpendicular from the carrier and the platen. The rotating carrier shaft may remain fixed in position relative to the rotating platen or may oscillate horizontally relative to the platen. The direction of rotation of the carrier is typically, though not necessarily, the same as that of the platen. The speeds of rotation for the carrier and the platen are generally, though not necessarily, set at different values. During the CMP process of the invention, the CMP composition of the present invention is usually applied onto the polishing pad as a continuous stream or in dropwise fashion. Customarily, the temperature of the platen is set at temperatures of from 10 to 70° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0084">The load on the wafer can be applied by a flat plate made of steel for example, covered with a soft pad that is often called backing film. If more advanced equipment is being used a flexible membrane that is loaded with air or nitrogen pressure presses the wafer onto the pad. Such a membrane carrier is preferred for low down force processes when a hard polishing pad is used, because the down pressure distribution on the wafer is more uniform compared to that of a carrier with a hard platen design. Carriers with the option to control the pressure distribution on the wafer may also be used according to the invention. They are usually designed with a number of different chambers that can be loaded to a certain degree independently from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0085">For further details reference is made to WO 2004/063301 A1, in particular page 16, paragraph [0036] to page 18, paragraph [0040] in conjunction with the FIG. 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0086">By way of the CMP process of the invention, wafers with integrated circuits comprising a dielectric layer can be obtained which have an excellent functionality, especially when the substrate or layer to be polished contains one or more III-V materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0087">The CMP composition of the present invention can be used in the CMP process as ready-to-use slurry, they have a long shelf-life and show a stable particle size distribution over long time. Thus, they are easy to handle and to store. They show an excellent polishing performance, particularly with regard to adjustable selectivity and high surface quality combined with minimal generation of the toxic gasses AsH<sub>3 </sub>and PH<sub>3</sub>. Since the amounts of its components are held down to a minimum, the CMP composition of the present invention and the CMP process according to the invention can be used or applied in a cost-effective way. A particular advantage of the CMP composition of the present invention is the high selectivity material removal of GaAs over InP.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">General Procedure for the CMP Experiments</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0093">The GaAs material removal rates (referred to as “GaAs-MRR” in the following) for 2 inch (=5.08 cm) discs polished by the CMP composition are determined by difference of weight of the coated wafers or blanket discs before and after CMP, using a Sartorius LA310 S scale. The difference of weight can be converted into the difference of film thickness since the density (5.32 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>for GaAs) and the surface area of the polished material are known. Dividing the difference of film thickness by the polishing time provides the values of the material removal rate. The InP material removal rates (referred to as “InP-MRR” in the following) were determined in the same manner.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0104">The data in table 1 show that polyethylene imines with varying molecular weight in a range of from 800 g/mol to 25000 g/mol have a suppressing effect on the material removal rate (MRR) on both GaAs and InP substrates. However, the suppression of the MRR of InP is much more pronounced compared to that of GaAs. This selective suppression results in a variation of the ratio MRR(GaAs)/MRR(InP). Compared with the CMP composition of comparative example 1, which does not contain polyethylene imine and has almost identical material removal rates for GaAs and InP, an increase of the ratio MRR(GaAs)/MRR(InP) to values in the range of from 7 to 24 is achieved in the presence of the above-mentioned polyethylene imines. This effect is unique to the combination of the surface-modified silica particles (A) having a negative zeta potential of −15 mV or below at a pH in the range of from 2 to 6 with a polyethylene imine (B), since replacement of polyethylene imine by other common additives like those used in comparative examples 2 and 3 does not have such pronounced effect on the ratio MRR(GaAs)/MRR(InP).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0105">Comparison examples 4 to 8 (Table 2) correspond to comparison example 1 and examples 1 to 4 according to the invention with the exception that NexSiI™ 125K (potassium-stabilized colloidal silica) is used as particles (A) instead of Levasil 200 A. While in the absence of polyethylene imine (comparative example 4) the ratio MRR(GaAs)/MRR(InP) is somewhat larger than in corresponding comparative example 1, the effect of the addition of a polyethylene imine having an average molecular weight Mw in the range of 800 g/mol to 25000 g/mol on the ratio MRR(GaAs)/MRR(InP) is remarkably lower than in the corresponding examples 1 to 4 according to the invention.</div>
