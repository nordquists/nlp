<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a semiconductor substrate polishing technology, and more particularly, to a slurry composition used in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and a method for polishing a substrate.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicon substrates in the form of silicon wafers used in the production of semiconductor substrates are subjected to various types of treatment such as photolithography, deposition treatment or polishing treatment, and are used to provide semiconductor devices. Silicon wafers are applied to numerous processing steps for the purpose of fabricating semiconductor devices, and since there is a need to improve the yield of semiconductor devices, there are strict requirements on the surface quality of the silicon wafers. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has conventionally been used for mirror-polishing silicon wafers to ensure the surface quality thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">When polishing a silicon wafer using CMP, typically the silicon wafer is held in a carrier for immobilizing the wafer and clamped between upper and lower surface plates adhered with an abrasive cloth comprised of a synthetic resin foam or suede-like artificial leather, followed by polishing by pressing and rotating the silicon wafer while supplying an aqueous composition dispersed with colloidal particles such as silica, alumina, ceria or zirconia particles (to be referred to as a slurry composition).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of CMP used on silicon wafers, there is a growing demand for improved productivity and surface quality accompanying the increased demand, higher performance levels and higher integration levels of semiconductor devices, and examples of areas where improvements can be made include improved removal rate, surface roughness, haze (surface clouding), flatness (roll-off (end face shear drop), SFQR, ESFQR) and scratch reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Among these required properties, in order to improve decreases in the yield of semiconductor substrates caused by defects in the silicon wafer, it is effective to improve the haze (surface clouding) of the silicon wafer in the CMP process. Various technologies have previously been proposed for improving the surface status of silicon wafers after polishing. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2011-97045 (Patent Document 1) describes a technology for improving haze that also improves removal rate by adding an alkylene diamine composition containing a propylene oxide structure to a polishing composition used in CMP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2011-97050 (Patent Document 2) describes the application of CMP after adding an alkylene diamine composition containing an oxyethylene group and oxypropylene group to a polishing composition in order to improve surface properties of a silicon wafer after final polishing. Moreover, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2013-31914 describes a polishing liquid for electronic materials that is resistant to scratching and contains a fatty acid amine salt that reduces the number of particles adhered to the substrate after polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Although these technologies are known, there has continued to be a need to provide a silicon wafer that realizes suitable removal rate and demonstrates improved surface clouding (haze) in order to improve the product yield of semiconductor substrates.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the following provides an explanation of the present invention through embodiments thereof, the present invention is not limited to the following embodiments. The slurry composition of the present invention for chemical mechanical polishing of a silicon wafer can at least contain a water-soluble polymer and an abrasive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The slurry composition of the present embodiment preferably at least contains a polymer having a tertiary amine structure in the main chain structure thereof. The addition of a polymer having a tertiary amine structure in the main chain structure thereof to the slurry composition makes it possible to improve surface cloudiness (to be referred to as haze) while improving decreases in RR, as well as maintain LPD in a favorable state while providing wide-ranging process compatibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The polymer used in the present invention can be produced by addition polymerizing an alkylene oxide at least including ethylene oxide with an active hydrogen of a polyamine compound having two or more primary amino groups and/or secondary amino groups and containing 4 to 100 nitrogen atoms in a molecule thereof. The weight average molecular weight of the polymer can be within the range of 5,000 to 100,000. In addition, although making the number of N atoms contained in the polymer of the present embodiment to be 2 to 10,000 is preferable from the viewpoint of providing water solubility for applying to a CMP process, the number of N atoms is preferably within the range of 2 to 1,000 from the viewpoint of providing adequate CMP process compatibility. In the present embodiment, this polymer is referred to as an alkylene polyalkylene oxide amine polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Examples of polyamine compounds imparting a main chain structure in the present embodiment include polyethylene polyamines such as triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine or hexaethyleneheptamine, and polyalkyleneimines such as polyethyleneimine obtained by polymerizing ethyleneimine. The aforementioned compounds may be used alone or two or more types may be used in combination to form the polyamine main chain structure of the present embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Examples of alkylene oxides added to the aforementioned main chain structure include ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide. These alkylene oxides can be used alone or as a mixture of a plurality of types thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The alkylene oxide backbone able to be used in the present embodiment is preferably selected from an ethylene oxide backbone and/or polypropylene backbone. By making the proportion of ethylene oxide in the alkylene oxide added to the polymer of the present embodiment to be 5% or more, preferably 10% or more or 50% to 90%, preferable CMP process compatibility can be imparted. In addition, in the case of containing a propylene oxide backbone in the present embodiment, containing within a range of 10% to 20% is similarly preferable in terms of widening the process margin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The polymer of the present embodiment can be easily produced by an ordinary method. For example, the polymer of the present embodiment can be produced by addition polymerizing (graft polymerizing) alkylene oxide to a starting substance in the form of the aforementioned polyamine compound at 100° C. to 180° C. and 1 atm to 10 atm in the presence of an alkaline catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">There are no particular limitations on the mode in which the alkylene oxide is added to the main chain backbone in the form of the polyamine compound, and may be in the form of block addition or random addition in the case of a form in which two or more types of alkylene oxides are added. The polymer of the present embodiment can have a weight average molecular weight of 5,000 or more and preferably 10,000 or more, and can preferably be within the range of 100,000 or less and more preferably 8,000 or less. In the case the weight average molecular weight is excessively low, haze cannot be adequately improved, while in the case it is excessively high, the dependency of each property on the added amount increases which narrows the process margin, thereby making this undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The main chain structure in the present description refers to a structure containing two or more repeating structural units containing a tertiary amine obtained by graft polymerizing polyalkylene oxide. Moreover, the tertiary amine that composes the main chain structure of the present embodiment preferably contains an N-alkylene group. There are no particular limitations on the number of C atoms that compose the N-alkylene group, and a linear or branched alkylene group having a number of C atoms within the range of 2 to 10 can be selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Specific examples of the polymer of the present embodiment include polymers represented by the following general formula (1) containing at least a tertiary amine structure in the main chain structure thereof formed by addition polymerization of an alkylene oxide to a polyethylene polyamine.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In general formula (1) above, m and n represent positive integers and A represents an alkylene group. R represents a linear or branched alkylene group having 2 or more carbon atoms. In the present embodiment, m can be within the range of 2 to 1000 and preferably 2 to 20, and n can be within the range of 2 to 10,000 and preferably 2 to 500. This is because, if the chain length of A is excessively long, haze improvement decreases, and if n is 10,000 or more, the dependency of each property on the amount added increases, thereby having a detrimental effect on process margin. AO can be formed using two or more types of alkylene oxides, and in the case of the present embodiment, different alkylene oxide groups may be in block form or random form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The solubility parameter of the alkylene polyalkylene oxide amine polymer given by the aforementioned chemical formula (1) in the present invention is preferably within the range of 9 to 10. Furthermore, solubility parameter (SP) in the present description refers to the SP value of a water-soluble polymer in terms of the SP value of the monomer determined using the method of Fedors described in Ueda, et al, Coating Film Research, No. 152, October 2010, pp. 41-46. If the aforementioned solubility parameter is less than 9.0, compatibility with aqueous solutions decreases and adequate effects are unable to be provided, while if the SP value is greater than 10.0, adequate haze improvement tends to inherently be difficult.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">3. Measurement Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Surface roughness (haze) of the washed silicon wafer surface was measured in the dark-field wide oblique (DWO) mode using the Surfscan SP2 manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corp. followed by using the resulting DWO value. LPD were measured using the same Surfscan SP2 manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corp., and using the value of LPD having a size of 37 nm or larger in the dark-field wide oblique (DWO) mode. In addition, removal rate was measured by dividing wafer weight difference before and after polishing by silicon wafer density, surface area and polishing time to determine the removal rate per unit time. Measurements were carried out at least twice for the same additive and under the same conditions, and the average value thereof was used for each value</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">4. Results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The measurement results for each additive are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the measurement results of haze and RR in the form of a table correlating the additives and amounts added. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the dependency of haze and RR on the solubility parameter. Furthermore, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ⋄ symbols indicate removal rate (RR) and ∘ symbols indicate haze. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as the solubility parameter became smaller, haze decreased in comparison with the decrease in RR (upper curve in the graph), or in other words, a tendency for haze to improve was observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph plotting the respective dependencies of additive concentration on RR and haze for Additives 1, 10 and 11 containing both an ethylene oxide chain and propylene oxide chain. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Δ symbols indicate RR and □ symbols indicated haze. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the SP values of Additives 1, 10 and 11 are roughly the same. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the added concentration of any of the additives increases, haze is shown to improve accompanying a decrease in RR. In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the numbers of LPD demonstrated values of 300 or less dependent on additive concentration for any of Additives 1, 10 and 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing the average LPD values at 37 nm DCO and 65 nm DCO for each of the Additives 1, 10 and 11. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Additive 1 yielded an average LPD value of 165 at 37 nm DCO and 13.5 at 65 nm DCO. These LPD values demonstrated improvements in LPD values of at least 2-fold or better in comparison with the average LPD values of 7155.5 at 37 nm DCO and 27.3 at 65 nm DCO for Additive 10, and the average LPD values of 285.3 at 37 nm DCO and 33.5 at 65 nm DCO for Additive 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Here, Additives 1 and 10 are both additives that contain an amine structure, and although the concentrations that yield the minimum value of haze differ, they demonstrated similar degrees of haze improvement. On the other hand, in the case of comparing the PEO-PPO block copolymer in the form of Additive 11 with Additives 1 and 10 containing an amine structure, improvement of haze was shown to reach its limit even if additive concentration was increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Moreover, when Additive 1 is compared with Additive 10, Additive 1 was shown to improve haze roughly linearly while maintaining RR up to high concentrations. On the other hand, Additive 10 demonstrated remarkable improvement of haze at low concentrations of the addition of Additive 10. However, the concentration dependency of Additive 10 was extreme, and in the case of attempting to improve haze while maintaining RR within a suitable range, the concentration range thereof was narrow in comparison with Additive 1, thereby preventing the obtaining of an adequate process margin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing the dependency of RR on haze resulting from the addition of Additives 1 and 11. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the PEO-PPO block copolymer in the form of Additive 11 resulted in a decrease in RR at an earlier stage than improvement of haze, and as a result thereof, demonstrated non-linear dependency. On the other hand, in the case of the alkylene polyalkylene oxide amine copolymer of the present embodiment in the form of Additive 1, sudden decreases in RR were shown to be inhibited. As a result, improvement of RR and haze in the case of Additive 1 did not yield a relationship indicating a high degree of tradeoff, and was determined to yield a roughly linear relationship. Consequently, Additive 1 did not result in extremely narrow process compatibility in the manner of Additive 10, and was shown to be able to demonstrate scalable improvement of haze while maintaining adequate process compatibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Moreover, Additive 10 can be said be superior to Additive 1 with respect to not causing a decrease in RR overall. However, in the case of comparing haze at about the same level of RR, Additive 10 was shown to cause much greater deterioration of haze (value becomes large) in comparison with Additive 1. This is because Additive 10 has an extremely narrow added concentration range for improving haze, and as a result thereof, was unable to provide adequate process stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">As has been described above, according to the present invention, a slurry composition and substrate polishing method can be provided that simultaneously improve haze and LPD value while inhibiting decreases in RR, while also making it possible to expand the range of process compatibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Although the previous description has provided an explanation of the invention using embodiments thereof, the present invention can be modified with respect to the incorporation of other embodiments, additions, modifications or deletions and the like within a range that can be conceived by a person with ordinary skill in the art, and any of these aspects are included within the scope of the present invention provided the action and effects of the present invention are still demonstrated.</div>
