<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a method of polishing a wafer and a wafer polishing apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A process for producing semiconductor wafers consists primarily of a step of pulling us a single-crystal for producing single-crystal ingots and a step of processing the single-crystal ingots thus produced. This processing step typically includes a slicing step, a lapping step, a chamfering step, an etching step, a mirror polishing step, a cleaning step and the like, and semiconductor wafers with mirror polished surfaces are produced through these steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the mirror polishing step, several stages of polishing steps including rough polishing, finish polishing and the like are performed. In the finish-polishing step, for example, one side of the wafer is subjected to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) with a single-side polishing apparatus <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. CMP is a technique in which a polishing solution having an etching effect on the wafer, the work being polished, is used to etch the wafer while mechanically polishing the wafer with abrasive grains contained in the polishing solution. The single-side polishing apparatus <b>200</b> includes a head <b>202</b> for retaining a wafer and a polishing plate <b>210</b> having a polishing cloth <b>212</b> provided on its surface. The head <b>202</b> presses a polishing target surface of the wafer against the polishing cloth <b>212</b>. Then, the wafer surface is polished by rotating the head <b>202</b> together with the polishing plate <b>210</b> while a polishing solution <b>228</b> is supplied from a polishing solution supply unit <b>226</b> to upon the polishing cloth <b>212</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, various impurities become adhered to an unused polishing cloth in the process of production of the polishing cloth. These impurities cause damage to the wafer surface. For this reason, large numbers of light point defects (LPDs) are detected in a post-polishing inspection step performed on the surface of a wafer polished with a polishing cloth immediately after the start of use of the cloth. To solve this problem, as described in JP 2005-209863 A (PTL 1), in the case of using a new polishing cloth, it is used to polish a stipulated number of wafers not to be shipped as products and then the polishing of wafers to be shipped as products is performed. Note that in this Specification, the initial polishing step which is performed immediately after the start of use of a new polishing cloth and which provides a polished water that is not used as a product is called “dummy polishing mode,” while the polishing step which is performed thereafter and which provides a polished wafer that is used as a product is called “production polishing mode.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Up until now, once a stipulated number of rounds of dummy polishing have been done, or in other words, once the cumulative number of wafers polished with a new polishing cloth has reached the stipulated number of wafers, a shift to production polishing mode is done, and it is typical for the “stipulated number of rounds” and “stipulated number of wafers” to be uniformly set to fixed values as long as the same kind of polishing cloth is used.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, according to studies conducted by the present inventor, it was found that even with the same kind of polishing cloth (polishing cloth made from the same material, polishing cloth from the same product, etc.), the number of rounds of polishing performed in dummy polishing mode (cumulative number of wafers polished) required until the LPD count in polished wafers stabilizes at a low level is different for each individual polishing cloth. For this reason, with the conventional method in which the number of rounds of polishing performed in dummy polishing mode is uniformly set to a fixed number of rounds when using individual polishing cloths even though they are the same kind of polishing cloth, one of the following problems occurs. In the case of using a polishing cloth A in which the aforementioned number of rounds of dummy polishing required is greater than the set number of rounds of polishing performed in dummy polishing mode, wafers with large numbers of LPDs will remain, mixed in with the production wafers. On the other hand, in the case of using a polishing cloth B which is of the same kind as polishing cloth A, but in which the aforementioned number of rounds of dummy polishing required is less than the set number of rounds of polishing performed in dummy polishing mode, wafers of a quality level with such few LPDs that they should be able to be used as production wafers end up being fabricated by dummy polishing, leading to wafer losses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Stated differently, if the number of rounds of dummy polishing is set high in advance so that wafers with large numbers of LPDs do not remain, mixed in with the production wafers, the probability of wafer loss due to dummy polishing becomes higher, and conversely, if the number of rounds of dummy polishing is set low so as to reduce wafer loss due to dummy polishing, the probability of wafers with large numbers of LPDs remaining, mixed in with the production wafers becomes higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Note that PTL 1 describes that dummy polishing is to be performed until the concentration of copper within the polishing cloth becomes 0.01 ppm or less. However, this method requires that test pieces be cut from the polishing cloth in order to measure the concentration of copper, which must be improved in practice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of these problems, an object of this disclosure is to provide a practical method of polishing a wafer and a practical water polishing apparatus that can reduce wafer losses due to dummy polishing and also stabilize the LPD count in production wafers at a low level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventor made further studies to achieve the above object, and thus found the following. Firstly, the present inventor focused upon the contact angle of the polishing cloth as an index indicating the state of the surface of the polishing cloth. The inventor then found that the contact angle of the polishing cloth was closely related to the LPD count in the waters polished with that polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure completed based on the above findings, and its gist is as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of polishing a wafer according to the present disclosure, in which a water is brought into contact with a polishing cloth provided on a surface of a polishing plate, and the wafer and the polishing plate are rotated thereby performing several rounds of a polishing process on the surface of the wafer using the same polishing cloth, is characterized in that the polishing process comprises:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">based on the measured value thereof, a timing for a switchover from the initial polishing mode to the production polishing mode is determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, in order to determine the switchover timing, the contact angle of the polishing cloth may be measured regularly or in each round prior to the polishing process, and the polishing processes after the measured value stabilizes may be set to be performed in production polishing mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, in order to determine the switchover timing, when the measured value is equal to or less than a threshold value, the polishing processes thereafter may be set to be performed in production polishing mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In this case, a test polishing cloth of the same kind as the polishing cloth is preferably used to repeatedly perform the polishing process and a measurement of the contact angle of the test polishing cloth, and the threshold value is preferably determined based on the value of the contact angle of the test polishing cloth when the measured values are stabilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present disclosure, it is preferred that the polishing plate is spun so as to remove a polishing solution upon the polishing cloth immediately before the measurement of the contact angle of the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present disclosure, it is preferred that the wafer to be polished in the initial polishing mode is a dummy wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present disclosure, it is preferred that the contact angle of the polishing cloth is re-measured after the switchover from the initial polishing mode to the production polishing mode, and the timing of a replacement of the polishing cloth in the production polishing mode is determined based on the measured value thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">A wafer polishing apparatus according to the present disclosure is provided with</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">a head which retains a wafer; and</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">First, a single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> used in the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> includes a head <b>102</b> for fixing a wafer <b>104</b> and a polishing plate <b>110</b> having a surface provided with a polishing cloth <b>112</b>. The head <b>102</b> is connected to a motor <b>108</b> via a head elevating shaft <b>106</b>, so that the head <b>102</b> and the wafer <b>104</b> are rotated by driving the motor <b>108</b>. The polishing plate <b>110</b> is connected to a motor <b>116</b> via a polishing plate rotating shaft <b>114</b>, so that the polishing plate <b>110</b> is rotated by driving the motor <b>116</b>. The polishing target surface on the wafer is polished by bringing the wafer <b>104</b>, which is fixed to the head <b>102</b>, into contact with the polishing cloth <b>112</b>, rotating the head <b>102</b> and the polishing plate <b>110</b> together, while supplying a polishing solution <b>128</b> from a polishing solution supply unit <b>126</b> to the polishing cloth <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> has a contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b> for measuring the contact angle of the polishing cloth <b>112</b>. The contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b> measures the contact angle of a water drop <b>120</b> supplied onto the polishing cloth <b>112</b> from a water drop supply unit <b>118</b>. This measurement indicates the surface condition of the polishing cloth <b>112</b>. A control unit <b>124</b>, which may be of arbitrary constitution in the present disclosure, receives input of data containing values measured by the contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b>. The functions of the control unit <b>124</b> will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The kind of the polishing cloth <b>112</b> is not limited. For example, a single-layer polishing cloth may be used or a two-layer polishing cloth in which a sponge layer is formed on the rear surface of a polishing cloth layer may be used. As the polishing cloth layer of the single-layer polishing cloth and the two-layer polishing cloth, for example, a polishing cloth composed of a synthetic resin foam such as urethane foam, a polishing cloth of a hard velour type in which a non-woven cloth made of polyester fabric is impregnated with a urethane resin, or a suede pad in which a urethane resin had been foamed on a nonwoven base fabric may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The location of the polishing cloth, to be supplied with a water drop for measuring the contact angle is not limited as long as the wafer <b>104</b> passes by the location during polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As the polishing solution <b>128</b>, for example, an alkaline polishing solution containing colloidal silica or the like as abrasive grains may be used. The location to be supplied with the polishing solution is not limited in particular; however, the polishing solution is preferably supplied to the vicinity of the rotational orbit of the head <b>102</b> at the center.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">(Method of Polishing One Side of a Wafer)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, a method of polishing one side of a wafer according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the present inventor used the single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to sequentially finish-polish a plurality of wafers one at a time using two new polishing cloths (polishing cloths A and B) made of suede material. The contact angle of the polishing cloth was measured immediately before each of the finish-polishing steps. In addition, the LPD count in each polished wafer was measured with a laser particle counter. This is provided, however, the first 20 rounds of polishing done were considered to be dummy polishing, so the measurement of the contact angle of the polishing cloth and the measurement of the wafer LPD count after polishing were not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> presents the relationship between the LPD count and the cumulative number of wafers polished by polishing cloth A and polishing cloth B, respectively. With polishing cloth A, the LPD count on the 21st wafer was extremely large, in excess of 350 defects, but as polishing with polishing cloth A continued, the LPD count also decreased and at around the 40th wafer or so, the LPD count stabilized at around 50 defects. On the other hand, with polishing cloth B, the LPD count had already dropped below 50 defects on the 21st wafer, and the LPD count remained stabilized at around 50 defects in wafers polished thereafter. In this manner, it was confirmed that even with the same kind of polishing cloth, the number of rounds of polishing that must be performed until the LPD count of the polished wafer stabilizes (the cumulative number of wafers polished) is different for each individual polishing cloth. Because of this, it is appreciated that with a method in which the timing of the change from dummy polishing mode to production polishing mode is uniformly determined based on the cumulative number of wafers polished, as described above, a sacrifice must be made of either LPD dispersion in production wafers or wafer losses due to dummy polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> presents the relationship between the contact angle of the polishing cloth and the cumulative number of wafers polished by polishing cloth A and polishing cloth B, respectively. With polishing cloth A, the contact angle measured immediately before polishing the 21st wafer was relatively high at roughly 65 degrees, indicating a hydrophobic state, and as polishing with polishing cloth A continued thereafter, the contact angle of the polishing cloth also decreased until the contact angle immediately before polishing the 40th and subsequent wafers stabilized within a range of 20-30 degrees, indicating a hydrophilic state. On the other hand, with polishing cloth B, the contact angle immediately before polishing the 21st wafer was already roughly 25 degrees, and thereafter the contact angle of the polishing cloth was stabilized within a range of 20-30 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, one can see that there is a good correlation between the contact angle of the polishing cloth and the LPD count of the wafers polished with that polishing cloth, in the sense that wafers polished in the state in which the contact angle of the polishing cloth is high have large numbers of LPDs, but wafers polished with a low contact angle have few LPDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In view of this, it is decided that, when performing finish polishing with different polishing cloths of the same kind as polishing cloths A and B, rather than uniformly setting the number of rounds of dummy polishing to 20 rounds, the contact angle of the polishing cloth is measured every round before polishing or regularly, and all subsequent polishing in production polishing mode is performed only once the contact angle can be confirmed to have dropped to within the range of 20-30 degrees and stabilized. By doing so, it is possible to make the LPD count of the wafers obtained in production polishing mode stable at a low level, and also the wafer losses due to dummy polishing can be made as low as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, based on these findings, an embodiment of the method of wafer polishing according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Different polishing cloths of the same kind as polishing cloths A and B are mounted onto the surface of polishing plate and the polishing method according to this embodiment is started. First, a dummy wafer is secured in the head (step S<b>1</b>), and the wafer thus secured is polished in dummy polishing mode (step S<b>2</b>). Upon completion of dummy polishing, the polished dummy wafer is removed from the head, and the polishing plate is spun to remove the polishing solution from the polishing cloth (step S<b>3</b>). Thereafter, the contact angle of the polishing cloth is measured (step S<b>4</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Based on the measured value of the contact angle, it is determined whether or not three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees (step S<b>5</b>). If this condition is not satisfied, the operation is returned to step S<b>1</b> and the wafer is polished in dummy polishing mode. To wit, a determination of No will naturally result after the first and second rounds of dummy polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, if in step S<b>5</b>, a determination is made that three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees, the operation is switched to production polishing mode. To wit, a production wafer is secured in the head (step S<b>6</b>), and the production wafer thus secured is subjected to finish polishing in production polishing mode (step S<b>7</b>). All subsequent polishing can be done in production polishing mode. To wit, if not at the end of a polishing run (step S<b>8</b>), the previous polished production wafer is removed from the head and a new production wafer is secured in the head (step S<b>6</b>), the operation is returned to production polishing mode (step S<b>7</b>), and repeat. At the end of the polishing run (step S<b>8</b>), the operation is terminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">With this method, in the case of using a polishing cloth having the same properties as polishing cloth A, the polishing after approximately the 40th wafer will become production polishing, but in the case of using a polishing cloth having the same properties as polishing cloth B, the polishing will become production polishing after less than 20 wafers (for example the 15th wafer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">With the method according to this embodiment, when the polishing process is performed multiple times with the same polishing cloth, as illustrated above, the contact angle of the polishing cloth is measured and, based on this measured value, the timing of the switchover from the initial polishing mode (dummy polishing mode) to the production polishing mode is determined. Thus, it is possible to reduce wafer losses due to dummy polishing and also stabilize the LPD count in production wafers at a low level. In addition, the polishing cloth is evaluated in a nondestructive manner so its practicality is high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Specifically, as described above, the contact angle of the polishing cloth is measured regularly or every time after the polishing process, and once the measured value stabilizes, it is possible to set the next and subsequent polishing processes to be performed in production polishing mode. In the present embodiment, if three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees (or namely, when three measured values first fall within ±3 degrees) the contact angle is deemed to have stabilized (in the asymptotic state). Although the convergent value of the contact angle differs somewhat depending on the kind of polishing cloth, this definition is applicable independent of the kind of polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As another way of determining the switchover timing, it is possible to experimentally find the contact angle at such time that wafers with few LPDs are obtained and make the determination in step S<b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> “whether or not the measured value of the contact angle is equal to a stipulated value or less.” For example, if the measured value exceeds 30 degrees in step S<b>5</b>, the operation is returned to dummy polishing mode (step S<b>2</b>), but if the measured value is 30 degrees or less, the operation is advanced to production polishing mode (step S<b>6</b>), in this manner, it is possible to determine that the polishing process for the next and subsequent wafers is to be done in production polishing mode if the measured value of the contact angle of the polishing cloth is equal to or less than a threshold value. Moreover, this threshold value is determined, upon repeatedly performing the polishing process and measuring the contact angle of test polishing cloth which is the same kind as the polishing cloth used in finish polishing (in the aforementioned case, polishing cloths A and B), based on the value at the time that the measured value of the contact angle of the test polishing cloths is stabilized. In the present embodiment, the contact angles of polishing cloths A and B stabilized within the range of 20 to 30 degrees, so 30 degrees was set as the threshold value. The determination of whether or not the measured value has stabilized is performed, as described above, based on whether or not three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees. The method of determining the threshold value is not particularly limited; for example, it may be the average value of the above three values or the maximum value of the three values. Note that in the present embodiment, the contact angle is measured based on the θ/2 method upon dropping a 1,000 μg drop of water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The measurement of the contact angle of the polishing cloth is not limited to being performed each round after polishing in dummy polishing mode as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the contact angle may also be measured once every two rounds of polishing in dummy polishing mode. In addition, if the minimum required number of rounds of dummy polishing is already known from experience, the measurement of the contact angle may be started after that number of rounds of dummy polishing is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Here, the waters polished in dummy polishing mode will not become products, so it is preferable that the wafer to be polished in the dummy polishing mode is a dummy wafer which is lower in cost than a production wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after the switchover to production polishing mode, it is not always necessary to measure the contact angle. However, it is also possible to measure the contact angle of the polishing cloth even in production polishing mode and determine the timing to replace the polishing cloth in production polishing mode based on the measured value thereof. To wit, the contact angle of the polishing cloth is a strong index for making a determination of the lifetime of the polishing cloth. Polishing cloths are consumables and up until now, a polishing cloth had been used for a stipulated number of rounds of polishing and then discarded and replaced with a new polishing cloth. However, the number of rounds of polishing for which a polishing cloth can actually be used until it is unusable may depend on the individual polishing cloth or the polishing conditions, and not only had there been dispersion but it had been difficult to determine whether or not a polishing cloth is usable. For this reason, the aforementioned stipulated number of rounds had been set with a safety margin within a range that the polishing cloth is still usable. However, it was found that the contact angle of the polishing cloth increases gradually in production polishing mode toward the end of use. Thus, it is possible to set the stage at which the contact angle assumes a stipulated threshold value as the limit of use for the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, the contact angle can be measured after polishing in production polishing mode, and if the measured value is equal to or less than a stipulated threshold value, that polishing cloth may be deemed to be still usable and supplied as is for the next round of polishing in production polishing mode, but if the measured value exceeds the stipulated threshold value, that polishing cloth may be deemed unusable, prompting its replacement. In this manner, one may ascertain the surface state of the polishing cloth from the contact angle of the polishing cloth, and thereby accurately determine the timing to replace the polishing cloth, thereby permitting the polishing cloth to be used up to the very end of the true service lifetime of the polishing cloth. This can reduce wafer fabrication costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The threshold value of the contact angle of the polishing cloth depends on the kind of polishing cloth, its hardness, coefficient of restitution and other factors, but may be set to 70 degrees, for example. In addition, the determination of lifetime based on the contact angle of the polishing cloth explained here may also be performed independently of the aforementioned determination of the timing of the switchover from dummy polishing mode to production polishing mode based on the contact angle of the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the single-side finish polishing method in which one wafer is polished each round has been discussed, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, as it can also be applied to a method of polishing a plurality of wafers in one round or to a two-sided polishing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present disclosure, the determination of the switchover timing from dummy polishing mode to production polishing mode based on the measured value of the contact angle, and the determination of the timing for replacing the polishing cloth may also be performed automatically by means of the control unit <b>124</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> has a memory (not shown), and this memory stores data representing the threshold value A (in the present embodiment, 30 degrees) used at the time of performing the switchover from dummy polishing mode to production polishing mode, and data representing the threshold value B (in the present embodiment, 70 degrees) used at the time of performing the replacement of the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Upon receiving input of the measured value of the contact angle of the polishing cloth <b>112</b> output from the contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b> in the stage of dummy polishing, the control unit <b>124</b> reads out the data representing threshold value A from the memory, compares threshold value A and the measured value and makes a determination as to whether the next and subsequent rounds of polishing are to be performed in dummy polishing mode or in production polishing mode. The control unit <b>124</b> stores the results of determination (more specifically, a combination of the cumulative number of rounds of polishing n and the results of determination) in memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively, upon receiving input of the measured value of the contact angle of the polishing cloth <b>112</b> output from the contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b> in the stage of dummy polishing, the control unit <b>124</b> determines whether or not three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees, and makes a determination as to whether the next and subsequent rounds of polishing are to be performed in dummy polishing mode or in production polishing mode. The control unit <b>124</b> stores the results of determination (more specifically, a combination of the cumulative number of rounds of polishing n and the results of determination) in memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The user of the single-side wafer polishing apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment may, by reading out the results of determination from memory later, can ascertain the wafer position at which to start placing production wafers. In addition, the control unit <b>124</b> may also separately use a notification means such as a speaker, display or the like to notify users of the results of determination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Upon receiving input of the measured value of the contact angle of the polishing cloth <b>112</b> output from the contact-angle measuring device <b>122</b> during the production polishing stage, the control unit <b>124</b> reads out the data representing threshold value B front the memory, compares threshold value B and the measured value and makes a determination as to whether the polishing cloth is to be replaced. The control unit <b>124</b> may store the results of determination in memory. In addition, if the measured value exceeds threshold value B, control unit <b>124</b> does not permit motors <b>108</b> and <b>116</b> to drive.

<heading id="h-0009">Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Silicon wafers having a diameter of 300 mm were subjected to an experiment. Suede polishing cloth of the same kind as the polishing cloth used in the experiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> was mounted on the polishing plate of the single-side wafer polishing apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This single-side wafer polishing apparatus was used to perform finish polishing of the silicon wafers one at a time. The polishing conditions were as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Polishing pressure: 125 g/cm<sup>2 </sup> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Polishing time: 360 s</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Polishing solution: alkaline polishing solution (containing colloidal silica)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">After the polishing of each silicon wafer, purified water was dripped onto the polishing cloth, and the contact angle of the polishing cloth was measured using an automated contact angle meter (DMs-400Hi/400 manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd.). Polishing was performed in accordance with the flow illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. To wit, after three or more consecutive measured values are within ±3 degrees, polish in production polishing mode. As a result, 42 rounds of polishing were done in dummy polishing mode, and then production polishing mode was started. In this experiment, 100 rounds of polishing were done in production polishing mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The contact angle of the polishing cloth at the end of production polishing mode was 28 degrees. Thereafter, upon investigating the change in the contact angle by further continuing to alternate polishing of silicon wafers and measurement of the contact angle, a trend was observed wherein the contact angle began to increase greatly after the 252nd round of polishing in production polishing mode. This polishing cloth had been conventionally replaced after roughly 200 rounds of polishing in order to reliably avert the mixing in of wafers with large numbers of LPDs, whereas, in this experiment, it was possible to use the polishing cloth up to the very end of the true service lifetime of the polishing cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The surfaces of the wafers polished in production polishing mode were measured with a laser particle counter (manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation, model SP-3) to find the LPD count. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Comparative Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Silicon wafers having a diameter of 300 mm were subjected to an experiment. Suede polishing cloth of the same kind as the polishing cloth used in the experiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> was mounted on the polishing plate of the single-side wafer polishing apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This single-side wafer polishing apparatus was used to perform finish polishing of the silicon wafers one at a time. The polishing conditions were the same as in Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The polishing process was performed in 100 rounds, with the first 20 rounds in dummy polishing mode and the 21st and subsequent rounds in production polishing mode. The LPD count of the wafers polished in production polishing mode was found in the same manner as in Example. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Results</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As is evident from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in Comparative Example, wafers with large numbers of LPDs remained and were mixed in with the wafers subjected to polishing in production polishing mode, so the dispersion in LPD count was large. It is appreciated that the polishing cloth used in Comparative Example was polishing cloth having the same properties as polishing cloth A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. On the other hand, in Example, since the number of rounds of dummy polishing was 42 rounds, it is appreciated that again a polishing cloth having the same properties as polishing cloth A was used, but the count of the wafers subjected to polishing in production polishing mode was stabilized at a low level. Note that where the average LPD count was 97.4 defects and the standard deviation was 79.4 in Comparative Example, the average LPD count in Example was 45.8 defects and the standard deviation was 13.9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The single-side wafer polishing method and wafer polishing apparatus according to the present disclosure provide a practical wafer polishing method that is able to reduce wafer losses due to dummy polishing and also stabilize the LPD count in production wafers at a low level.</div>
