<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Chemical Mechanical Polish (CMP) processes are widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. When an integrated circuit is built up layer by layer on the surface of a semiconductor wafer, CMP processes are used to planarize the topmost layer to provide a planar surface for subsequent fabrication steps. CMP processes are carried out by polishing the wafer surface against a polish pad. A slurry, that in some aspects contains both abrasive particles and reactive chemicals, is applied to the polish pad. The relative movement of the polish pad and wafer surface coupled with the reactive chemicals in the slurry allows the CMP process to planarize the wafer surface by means of both physical and chemical forces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">CMP processes can be used for the fabrication of various components of an integrated circuit. For example, CMP processes may be used to planarize inter-level dielectric layers and inter-metal dielectric layers. CMP processes are also commonly used in the formation of the copper lines that interconnect the components of integrated circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">After a CMP process, the surface of the wafer, on which the CMP process has been performed, is cleaned to remove residues. The residues may include organic matter and particles, among other things. In recent generations of integrated circuits, the sizes of the integrated circuit devices are reduced to a very small scale. The small scale of recent generations of integrated circuits poses a demanding requirement on the post-CMP cleaning over the post-CMP cleaning requirements for older generations of integrated circuits. For example, the size of the particles that remain after the post-CMP cleaning cannot exceed a half of the critical dimension (the gate length) of the transistors on the wafer. Obviously, with the size reduction of the integrated circuit devices, the removal of particles and residue from the wafer become more demanding.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a CMP system <b>100</b> where one or more semiconductor substrates or wafers <b>124</b> (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may undergo a CMP process, including a post-CMP cleaning, is presented. In some embodiments, the CMP system <b>100</b> includes an interface <b>102</b>, a cleaning module <b>104</b> and a polishing or planarization module <b>106</b>. In an embodiment, the CMP system <b>100</b> includes a dry robot <b>108</b> to transfer the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> between the interface <b>102</b> and the cleaning module <b>104</b>. In yet some embodiments, the CMP system <b>100</b> further includes a wet robot <b>110</b> to transfer the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> between the cleaning module <b>104</b> and the planarization module <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The interface <b>102</b> generally includes one or more cassettes <b>112</b> for storing the substrates or wafers <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the dry robot <b>108</b> is configured to transfer the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> between the one or more cassettes <b>112</b> and the cleaning module <b>104</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates four storage cassettes <b>112</b>, however, in some embodiments there may be less than four cassettes <b>112</b> or there may be more than four cassettes <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the dry robot <b>110</b> has sufficient range of motion to facilitate transfer between the storage cassettes <b>112</b> and the cleaning module <b>104</b>. Optionally, the range of motion of the dry robot <b>108</b> may be increased by adding additional linkages to the robot or placing the robot on a rail mechanism. The dry robot <b>108</b> is also configured to receive the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> from the cleaning module <b>104</b> and return cleaned, polished substrates or wafers <b>124</b> to the cassettes <b>112</b>. The wet robot <b>110</b>, in some embodiments, has sufficient range of motion to transfer the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> between the cleaning module <b>104</b> and one or more load cups <b>114</b> disposed on the planarization module <b>106</b>. The range of motion of the wet robot <b>110</b> may optionally be increased by adding additional linkages to the robot or placing the robot on a rail mechanism. In other embodiments (not shown), the wet robot <b>110</b> may be configured to transfer the substrates or wafers <b>124</b> between the interface <b>102</b>, the cleaning module <b>104</b> and/or the planarization module <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The cleaning module <b>104</b>, in some embodiments, is used in a post-CMP process to clean the wafer <b>124</b>. The CMP process may leave debris, including organic and inorganic residues, as well as watermarks on the wafer <b>124</b>. The cleaning module <b>104</b> may be used to remove at least some of the debris and/or the watermarks from the wafer <b>124</b> that collects on the wafer <b>124</b> during the CMP process. In some embodiments, the cleaning module <b>104</b> may use brushes (not shown) to remove the residue from the wafer <b>124</b>. In yet some embodiments, the cleaning module <b>104</b> may use a sonic cleaner (not shown), such as a megasonic cleaner, to remove the residue from the wafer <b>124</b>. In other embodiments, the cleaning module <b>104</b> may use both brushes and a sonic cleaner to remove the residue from the wafer <b>124</b>. The post-CMP cleaning step may include a plurality of steps including and not limited to, cleaning using an acidic chemical solution, cleaning using an alkaline chemical solution, cleaning using a neutral chemical solution, and rinsing with deionized water (DIW). The post-CMP cleaning may also include a plurality of cycles, each including a chemical solution cleaning step and a rinsing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, but with particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the planarization module <b>106</b> includes a plurality of planarization stations <b>116</b>. Each of the plurality of planarization stations <b>116</b> has a rotating table or platen <b>118</b>. The platen <b>118</b> is covered by a polishing pad <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the polishing pad <b>120</b> is adhered to the platen <b>118</b> through a vacuum system <b>122</b> that is external or internal to the CMP system <b>100</b>. The platen <b>118</b> may be provided with a series of distributed holes (not shown) operatively connected to the vacuum system <b>122</b>, allowing the polishing pad <b>120</b> to be subjected to an appropriate vacuum. The polishing pads <b>120</b>, in some embodiments, may be comprised of cast or sliced polyurethane, polyurethane impregnated polyester felt, or another suitable material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The wafer <b>124</b> is connected to a polishing spindle <b>126</b> such that a surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> to be polished faces the polishing pad <b>120</b> and the platen <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the polishing spindle <b>126</b> may also be referred to as a head or a carrier. The polishing spindle <b>126</b> is adaptable to accept the wafer <b>124</b> from and return the wafer <b>124</b> to the load cup <b>114</b>. The wafer <b>124</b> may be held by vacuum to the polishing spindle <b>126</b> or held thereto by a backing film <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, the wafer <b>124</b> is encompassed by a retainer ring <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The wafer <b>124</b> may be hydrophobic and, in some embodiments, has a surface <b>138</b> formed of poly-silicon, silicon nitride, silicon oxide or other component that intrinsically has a hydrophobic surface property. In another embodiment, the wafer <b>124</b> is not inherently hydrophobic, but may undergo treatments during the CMP process that cause at least the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> to have hydrophobic properties. For example, and as will be discussed in more detail below, the wafer <b>124</b> may be treated with slurries or solutions that cause the wafer <b>124</b> or the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> to have hydrophobic properties or otherwise increase the hydrophobicity of the wafer <b>124</b> or the surface <b>138</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A planarization slurry <b>132</b> may be introduced onto the polishing pad <b>120</b> via a slurry dispenser <b>134</b>. It should be appreciated that the planarization slurry <b>132</b> may have different properties depending on the type of surface treatment being applied to the wafer <b>124</b>, the type of CMP process being performed or the stage of the CMP process. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that a number of different types of surface treatments may be performed on the wafer <b>124</b> during various stages of the CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the initial CMP process steps may be focused on surface treatments that include planarization of the wafer <b>124</b> and, therefore, may use slurries, such as the planarization slurry <b>132</b>, that include chemical or mechanical etchants and/or have strong hydrophobic properties. Slurries with strong hydrophobic properties may dry quicker than other types of slurries. In some aspects, the application of slurries with hydrophobic properties may cause a thin hydrophobic film (not shown) to be formed on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>. As will be described in more detail below, allowing a hydrophobic film to form on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> or otherwise leaving an already formed hydrophobic film on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> may cause problems in removing debris and watermarks in the post-CMP cleaning of the wafer <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the plurality of planarization stations <b>116</b> may further include a high pressure rinse dispenser <b>135</b> for applying a high pressure rinse onto the polishing pad <b>120</b> to rinse-off the wafer <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the high pressure rinse dispenser <b>135</b> applies the high pressure rinse at a flow rate of approximately 1 to 50 L/min. The high pressure rinse dispenser <b>135</b> may, for example, dispenses a hydrophilic slurry or hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> onto the polishing pad <b>120</b>. The high pressure rinse may be applied in later CMP process step(s) that are focused on surface treatments that include preparing the wafer <b>124</b> for post-CMP cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> has strong hydrophilic properties. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> may be a hydrophilic solution or include a hydrophilic solution that is operable to change the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic on a molecular level. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> may include the properties of being acidic, having a low molecular-weight poly-glycol polymer functional group, and include a wetting agent with an OH— group, which together help make the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> operable to change the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic on a molecular level. In yet some embodiments, the acidic range of the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is between a pH of about 3-5. The hydrophilic solution <b>137</b>, generally, will not contain sulfur or metal ions. One such hydrophilic solution is Planerlite 6000™ sold by Fujimi Corporation. Embodiments in which the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is operable to change the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic will be discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">A pad conditioner <b>136</b> may also be employed to prepare and condition the surface of the polishing pad <b>120</b> during, before and/or after CMP processes. The pad conditioner <b>136</b> may condition the polishing pad <b>120</b> to provide a flat surface, remove glazing from the polishing pad <b>120</b>, restore asperities, and/or other suitable conditioning. In some embodiments, the pad conditioner <b>136</b> may be a diamond CMP conditioner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">During the CMP process, including the pre-cleaning stage of the CMP process, the polishing spindle <b>126</b> is rotated. The polishing spindle <b>126</b> places the wafer <b>124</b> against the polishing pad <b>120</b> as both the polishing spindle <b>126</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b> rotates. In some embodiments, the polishing spindle <b>126</b> may press the wafer <b>124</b> against the polishing pad <b>120</b> to apply a mechanical pressure between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b>. In alternative embodiments, no pressure or de minimis pressure is applied between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b>. Generally, pressure is applied between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b> during planarization and no pressure or de minimis pressure (relative the mechanical pressure that may be applied during planarization steps) is applied during the pre-cleaning stage. The planarization slurry <b>132</b> or the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is then introduced onto the polishing pad <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Whether the planarization slurry <b>132</b> or the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is dispensed onto the polishing pad <b>120</b> depends on the surface treatment being applied to the wafer <b>124</b> and/or the stage of the CMP process. For example, and as previously mentioned, during the planarization stages of the wafer <b>124</b>, the planarization slurry <b>132</b> is applied to the polishing pad <b>120</b>, where the planarization slurry <b>132</b> includes chemical and/or mechanical etchants, hydrophobic properties or both. During planarization, the CMP process steps may rely on the chemical etchants or abrasive properties of the slurry <b>132</b> as well as mechanical pressure being applied between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b>, e.g., force applied between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b>, to smooth out or otherwise planarize the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>. In the pre-cleaning stage of the CMP process, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> will generally be applied to the polishing pad <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the pre-cleaning step is performed on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> prior to the wafer <b>124</b> being removed from the planarization module <b>106</b>, or otherwise, prior to the wafer <b>124</b> being moved to other platens within the planarization module <b>106</b>. As previously mentioned, the CMP process may leave debris, including organic and inorganic residues on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>. In some aspects, the debris may be difficult to remove in subsequent steps, including post-CMP cleaning steps for a number of different reasons. In some aspects, the debris may be especially difficult to remove in further steps if the debris is allowed to dry on the wafer <b>124</b>. And, in operation, it may take several minutes before the wafer <b>124</b> is presented for buffing or a post-CMP cleaning process, allowing the debris to dry on the wafer <b>124</b> before a subsequent cleaning step is performed. Additionally, the speed of transfer between one platen to another may increase the rate of drying before the wafer <b>24</b> is presented for buffing or a post-CMP cleaning process. Furthermore, the surface properties of the wafer <b>124</b> may make it difficult to remove debris that has dried on the wafer <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the hydrophobicity of the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> can cause the debris to bond, stick or otherwise adhere to the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> in such a manner that it may become difficult to remove some of the debris. In some aspects, the debris may also be hydrophobic, thus, creating a tendency for a greater bond between the surface <b>138</b> (when the surface <b>138</b> is hydrophobic or allowed to form a hydrophobic film due to the composition of the planarization slurry <b>132</b> applied during the CMP process) and the debris.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">To prevent or otherwise disrupt bonding between the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> and the debris, a pre-cleaning step may be performed to prepare the wafer <b>124</b> for the post-CMP cleaning. The pre-cleaning step to be performed may include the step of, after the wafer <b>124</b> is polished on the platen <b>118</b>, applying a high pressure rinse to the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> via the high pressure rinse dispenser <b>135</b>. The high pressure rinse may include the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b>, which is operable to alter the surface properties on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. In an embodiment, the high pressure rinse is applied to the wafer <b>124</b> before the wafer <b>124</b> is allowed to dry. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> that was applied during the high pressure rinse may be allowed to soak on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> prior to transferring the wafer <b>124</b> for further cleaning. In an embodiment, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> includes the Planerlite 6000™ solution sold by Fujimi Corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In one illustrative embodiment, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is applied at approximately 25 degrees Celsius. In another illustrative embodiment, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is applied at 25 degrees Celsius plus or minus 5 degrees Celsius. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> includes a hydrophilic solution such as the Planerlite 6000™ solution having a concentration of approximately 0.1 to 10 percent mixed in DIW. It will be appreciated, however, that the concentration may be greater than 10 percent or less than 5 percent. In yet some embodiments, the flow rate of the high pressure rinse is approximately 500 to 50,000 milliliters per minute (mL/min). It will be appreciated, however, that this is merely an exemplary embodiment and that the flow rate may be less than 500 or greater than 50,000 milliliters per minute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The cleaning step, which occurs after the high pressure rinse and/or soak has been applied, may be by way of a buffing step or treatment. The buffing treatment may be performed using the same production tool that is used for the CMP. Furthermore, the buffing treatment may be performed on the same polish pad <b>120</b>, although different production tool and/or a different polish pad may be used. During the buffing step, the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> may be buffed. In an embodiment, the wafer <b>124</b> is buffed in the planarization module <b>106</b>. In yet some embodiments, the wafer <b>124</b> is moved within the planarization module <b>106</b> to another platen before the wafer <b>124</b> is buffed. In some embodiments, the buffing step may be bypassed or not performed such that the wafer <b>124</b> is taken directly from the high pressure rinse or soaking phase to a post-CMP cleaning step. In yet some embodiments, the post-CMP cleaning step occurs in the cleaning module <b>104</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, after the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> has been applied during the rinsing step, the wafer <b>124</b> is allowed to soak in the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b>. In some aspects, the wafer <b>124</b> soaks in the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> for approximately 5 to 30 seconds. In an embodiment, the wafer <b>124</b> soaks in the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> for approximately 10 seconds. It should be appreciated, that the wafer <b>124</b> may soak in the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> for less than 5 seconds or greater than 30 seconds. During the soaking step, the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b> may continue to rotate with or without force being exerted between the wafer <b>124</b> by the polishing pad. After the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is applied to the wafer <b>124</b>, the wafer <b>124</b> is removed from the platen <b>118</b> to be cleaned in a cleaning step that may, for example, utilize brush or megasonic cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the wafer <b>124</b> may undergo various polishing/planarization steps during the CMP process while the wafer <b>124</b> is in the planarization module <b>106</b>. In an embodiment, after the last polishing step but prior to the post-CMP cleaning step, which may occur in the cleaning module <b>104</b>, the wafer <b>124</b> is subjected to a pre-cleaning step. The pre-cleaning step includes a rinsing step, which may be a high-pressure rinse. The rinsing step includes applying the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> to the wafer <b>124</b>, wherein the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> may act to alter the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is applied to the wafer <b>124</b> after the last polishing step in the CMP process but before the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> is allowed to dry. The wafer <b>124</b> may be rotated via the polishing spindle <b>126</b> as the polishing pad <b>120</b> and the platen <b>118</b> are also rotated as the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is applied. In some embodiments, mechanical pressure is applied during this step between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b>. In alternative embodiments, no pressure or de minimis pressure is applied between the wafer <b>124</b> and the polishing pad <b>120</b> relative the mechanical pressure that may be applied during previous CMP process steps, such as those that are related to planarization of the wafer <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref>, a schematic representation and flow diagram, according to an illustrative embodiment, is shown. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a schematic representation of the wafer <b>124</b> (where at least the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> is hydrophobic) interacting with a hydrophilic group <b>150</b>. In some aspects, the hydrophilic group <b>150</b> may include the hydrophilic solution <b>137</b>. As previously discussed, the wafer <b>124</b> may be intrinsically hydrophobic or the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> may become hydrophobic due to various slurries or solutions that have been applied to the surface <b>138</b> during the CMP process. When at least the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> is hydrophobic, the wafer <b>124</b> may have a hydrophobic interaction <b>146</b> with a hydrophobic group <b>148</b> found on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>. The hydrophobic group <b>148</b> may include debris or residue <b>140</b> from the CMP process. In some aspects, the hydrophobic group <b>148</b> may form a hydrophobic film (not shown) over the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>.

If the residue <b>140</b> becomes too strongly attached to the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>, as may occur if the residue <b>140</b> dries on the wafer <b>124</b>, it may be difficult to completely remove the residue <b>140</b> from the surface <b>138</b> during post-cleaning steps because the hydrophilic group <b>150</b> may be repelled or otherwise prevented from reaching the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>.</div>

Should the residue <b>140</b> and/or the DIW <b>144</b> be allowed to dry on the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>, a hydrophobic film (not shown) may be formed on the surface <b>138</b> with the residue <b>140</b> and the DIW bonded, attached, or otherwise connected to the hydrophobic film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Step <b>152</b>, illustrated by an arrow, represents treating the surface <b>138</b> with a surfactant, solution, or hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> that has hydrophilic properties that are operable to change the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The hydrophilic solution <b>137</b> is operable to make the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> hydrophilic, regardless of whether the surface <b>138</b> is hydrophobic or not. In some embodiments, a hydrophilic film <b>142</b> is formed on the surface <b>138</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</div>

The hydrophilic film <b>142</b> creates a barrier between the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b> and the residue <b>140</b> and the DIW <b>144</b>. In other words, the hydrophilic film <b>142</b> helps prevent the residue <b>140</b> from bonding or attaching to the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>.

The wafer <b>124</b> may be cleaned by a water-flush that removes the residue <b>140</b> and the DIW <b>144</b> from the surface <b>138</b> of the wafer <b>124</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The embodiments of the present disclosure have some advantageous features. By applying a slurry or a cleaning solution that changes the surface of the wafer from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, the cleaning step may be enhanced. The cleaning step may be enhanced in that the surface of the wafer has less residue after the surface of the wafer has been cleaned. Additionally, a buffing step may not be needed between the last polishing step in the CMP process and the cleaning step. This is advantageous in that an entire step may be skipped, providing savings in both cost and time. Moreover, the buffing step typically occurs on a separate platen than the polishing step, thus, requiring the wafer to be moved from one platen to another.</div>
