<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of polishing a silicon wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, CMP (chemical mechanical polishing), which is performed by relatively rotating a silicon wafer and a polishing cloth while supplying a polishing liquid containing abrasive grains (e.g., silica particles) in an alkaline aqueous solution, is generally used as a method of a polishing a surface of a silicon wafer. The CMP is a composite technique of a mechanical polishing action by the abrasive grains and a chemical polishing action by the alkaline aqueous solution. It is well known that a high flatness of the surface of the silicon wafer is obtained by compositing the above two polishing actions. The CMP of the silicon wafer is typically performed by a plurality of steps from a double-side polishing step to a one-side polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The double-side polishing step is performed in order to polish the silicon wafer to a desired thickness. Specifically, a front side and a rear side of the silicon wafer are simultaneously polished with a hard polishing cloth made of polyurethane and the like at a relatively high polishing speed. This double-side polishing flattens the silicon wafer so as to decrease a fluctuation in a thickness of the polished silicon wafer and removes waviness components (e.g., nanotopography).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The one-side polishing step is performed in order to improve roughness of one of surfaces of the silicon wafer after being subjected to the double-side polishing. Specifically, the one-side polishing step is performed with a soft polishing cloth such as a suede cloth in combination with micro abrasive grains so as to reduce micro roughness of the one of surfaces of the silicon wafer (e.g., nanotopography and haze). The one-side polishing step is performed at a plurality of stages with a variation of a type of the polishing cloth, a size of the abrasive grains and an alkali concentration in the polishing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a technique relating to the one-side polishing step in order to improve a haze of a surface of the silicon wafer, there have been disclosed: an abrasive agent used for a mirror-finish polishing of the silicon wafer, the abrasive agent containing alkaline silica, a water-soluble polymer, and a cyclic organic compound; and a method of polishing the silicon wafer using the abrasive agent (see Patent Literature 1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 5321430</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Problem(s) to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As reported also in Patent Literature 1, in the one-side polishing step, the water-soluble polymer is generally added into the polishing liquid in order to reduce the haze level of the surface of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">On a top surface layer of the silicon wafer after being subjected to the double-side polishing step, process damage (strain) induced by the mechanical action of the double-side polishing remains. Accordingly, in the subsequent one-side polishing step, it is necessary to polish the silicon wafer so as to remove the process damage. However, since the polishing speed (polishing rate) is considerably decreased when the water-soluble polymer is added in the polishing liquid, a considerably long time and considerably many steps are required for removing the process damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">With respect to the above problem, the silicon wafer after being subjected to the double-side polishing step is polished with the polishing liquid in which no water-soluble polymer is added in a first one-side polishing treatment (hereinafter, also referred to as a rough polishing), so that the process damage can be removed without decreasing the polishing speed. In the second and subsequent one-side polishing treatments (hereinafter, also referred to as a finish polishing), the silicon wafer is polished with the polishing liquid in which the water-soluble polymer is added, so that the silicon wafer can have a desired surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, experiments by the inventors have revealed that, when an epitaxial growth treatment is applied on the surface of the silicon wafer manufactured by the above rough polishing and finish polishing, many micro LPD (Light Point Defect) each having a size of 45 nm or less are formed on the surface of the manufactured epitaxial silicon wafer. Moreover, the inventors have found as described later that water mark defects are generated on the surface of the silicon wafer after being subjected to the rough polishing and the water mark defects cause generation of the micro LPD of the epitaxial silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the invention is to provide a method of polishing a surface of a silicon wafer, the method being capable of reducing generation of water mark defects on the surface of the silicon wafer in a one-side polishing step.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problem(s)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors diligently studied a cause of generation of micro LPD on a surface of an epitaxial silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to research the cause, with respect to the epitaxial silicon wafer having the micro LPD on the surface thereof, a map of the LPD was observed and substantial observation of the LPD was made using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Moreover, the substantial observation of the LPD was made using a wafer defect inspection system (MAWS manufactured by Lasertec Corporation) and AFM, thereby classifying the detects of the LPD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is the map of the LPD observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer, which shows that many micro LPD are scattered on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing the results of the defect classification of the LPD observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer. It is understood from the graph that the number of the micro concave defect is larger than that of a typical epitaxial defect such as SF (stacking fault) and hillock.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an AFM image of the micro concave defect observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon water. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a difference in height of a top surface between A and B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As apparently understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the micro concave defect actually observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer is a crater-shaped micro concave defect having a diameter of about 26 Î¼m and a height of about 15 nm and having an annularly bulging periphery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">It is inferred from the results that the micro concave defect determines a degree of the number of the micro LPD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, a cause of generation of the micro concave defect on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer was researched. Specifically, the surface of the silicon wafer before being subjected to the epitaxial growth treatment was observed in DIC mode using a surface defect inspection device (Surfscan SP-2: manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation), with respect to coordinate positions where defects each having a concave with a level difference of 3 nm or more and coordinate positions where micro concave defects were observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer. In comparison between both the above coordinate positions, it was confirmed that the coordinate positions where the defects each having a concave with a level difference of 3 nm or more substantially coincide with the coordinate positions where the micro concave defects were observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, a substantial observation was made using AFM on a portion where the defect was observed on the surface of the silicon wafer. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a difference in height of the top surface between C and D in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As apparently understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, similarly to the micro concave defect observed on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer, it was confirmed that the micro concave defect actually observed on the surface of the silicon wafer was a crater-shaped defect having a diameter of about 20 Î¼m and a height of about 22 nm and having an annularly bulging periphery (hereinafter, referred to as a water mark defect).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the annular water mark defect observed on the surface of the silicon wafer has a central part thinner than a periphery, it is inferred that a reaction in which the water mark defect is formed is accompanied by etching. Specifically, it is inferred that the water mark defect generated on the surface of the silicon wafer is caused by a phenomenon in which an aqueous solution containing an alkaline component and the like is present in a form of water drops on the surface of the silicon wafer, the surface of the silicon wafer is etched by the alkaline component in the aqueous solution and, simultaneously, oxygen in the air enters the water drops to react with the alkaline component, resulting in forming a reactant salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A step where this phenomenon possibly occurs was confirmed to be the one-side polishing step in which the water mark defect was generated during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air in the transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Probably, it is considered that the water mark defect is formed since the water drops containing a polishing slurry component remain on the surface of the silicon wafer after being subjected to the rough polishing step in the one-side polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an estimated mechanism of generating the water mark defect, A lower section of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to an upper section and shows a partially enlarged view of a top surface layer of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">After the rough polishing step is finished in the one-side polishing step, the polishing slurry having been used in the rough polishing is present as a residue on the polished surface of the silicon wafer. The polished surface is hydrophobic. Accordingly, as shown in the upper section of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, water drops containing the polishing slurry are formed on the polished surface. As shown in the lower section of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, the alkaline component (represented by K<sup>â</sup> and O<sup>â</sup> in the figure) derived from the polishing slurry is present in the water drops. Moreover, at parts in contact with the water drops on the top surface layer of the silicon wafer, silicon (represented by Si in the figure) of the top surface layer is eluted and captured into the water drops. In the transition from after the rough polishing is finished to the next finish polishing, oxygen (represented by O<sub>2 </sub>in the figure) present in the air is captured into the water drops while the polishing head is placed at a raised position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, after the rough polishing is finished, the silicon wafer is delivered in a dry condition in the air while being attached to the polishing head to proceed to the next step of the finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">While the silicon wafer is delivered in the air, KOH in the water drops etches Si at parts of the polished surface to which the water drops are attached. By this etching reaction, K<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3 </sub>are formed. The water drops are evaporated during the delivery of the silicon water in the air. Accordingly, the formed K<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3 </sub>remain in a manner to be accumulated on the periphery where the water drops are previously present (see the lower section of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In the finish polishing, the polished surface of the silicon wafer is subjected to the finish polishing (see the upper section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>). Since a polishing amount is small in the finish polishing, the water mark defect formed during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air is not completely removed, so that a crater-shaped water mark defect remains on the surface of the silicon water after being subjected to the finish polishing (see the lower section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that the water mark defect is defined as an annular defect having a height of at least about 10 nm and a diameter of at least about 10 Î¼m when a substantial observation is made on defects each having a concave with a level difference of 3 nm or more in DIC mode using a surface defect inspection device (Surfscan SP-2: manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, it has been found that the generation of the micro LPD on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer is caused by the water mark defect formed on the silicon wafer during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air in the transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing in the one-side polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention has been reached based on the above findings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an aspect of the invention, a method of polishing a silicon wafer, includes: a first polishing step of polishing a surface of the silicon wafer while supplying to a polishing cloth a first polishing liquid containing: a primary agent in a form of an alkaline aqueous solution; and abrasive grains, the first polishing liquid containing no water-soluble polymer; subsequent to the first polishing step, a protection film formation step of supplying a protection film formation solution containing a water-soluble polymer to the polishing cloth after being used in the first polishing step, and bringing the protection film formation solution into contact with the polished surface of the silicon wafer subjected to the first polishing step to form a protection film on the polished surface; and a second polishing step of polishing the surface of the silicon wafer where the protection film is formed while supplying, to a polishing cloth different from the polishing cloth used in the first polishing step, a second polishing liquid containing: a primary agent in a form of an alkaline aqueous solution; abrasive grains; and a water-soluble polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the above aspect of the invention, in the protection film formation step to be performed subsequent to the first polishing step, the protection film formation solution containing the water-soluble polymer is brought into contact with the polished surface of the silicon wafer. By this operation, the protection film is formed on the polished surface of the silicon wafer after being subjected to the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The protection film protects the polished surface from oxygen in the air during the delivery of the silicon water in the air in the transition from the first polishing step (rough polishing) to the second polishing step (finish polishing). Although the used polishing liquid remains in the polished surface after the rough polishing is finished, the protection film functions as an etching stopper for inhibiting etching by the alkaline component contained in the polishing liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Since the protection film thus prevents the polished surface from being exposed in the air, a reaction between the polished surface and oxygen in the air is inhibited. Moreover, the polished surface is free from being etched by the alkaline component remaining in the polishing liquid. Accordingly, in the one-side polishing step, generation of the water mark defect is reducible during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air in the transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing. Consequently, the micro concave defect caused by the water mark defect is reducible on the manufactured epitaxial silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, a polishing cloth used in the one-side polishing step is softer than a polishing cloth used in the double-side polishing step. Accordingly, since the polishing of the silicon wafer proceeds with the silicon wafer kept sunk in the polishing cloth, an effect by a reaction force of the polishing cloth to return becomes large on the periphery of the wafer, thereby generating a peripheral shear drop of the wafer, which is called âedge roll-off.â</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the initial period of the rough polishing, a temperature of heat generated by the polishing is high at the central part of the wafer and low at the periphery. Accordingly, with respect to a native oxide film present on the surface of the wafer before being subjected to the rough polishing, the native oxide film present at the central part of the wafer where the generated heat is high tends to be removed first and followed by the removal of the native oxide film present at the periphery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the protection film formation step, since the protection film is formed on the polished surface while the protection film formation solution containing the water-soluble polymer is supplied onto the polishing surface of the rough polishing cloth, the water-soluble polymer remains in the rough polishing cloth. Accordingly, in the first polishing step in the next cycle, the rough polishing is performed with the rough polishing cloth in which the water-soluble polymer remains. In this case, due to the water-soluble polymer, removability of the native oxide film from the surface of the silicon wafer is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, since the removability of the native oxide film is reduced in the rough polishing using the rough polishing cloth in which the water-soluble polymer remains, the polishing amount on the periphery of the wafer is reduced as the removal of the native oxide film from the surface of the wafer is delayed. In other words, by applying the polishing method according to the above aspect of the invention, the amount of the edge roll-off of the silicon wafer in the rough polishing at the next and subsequent cycles can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above aspect of the invention, the water-soluble polymer in the protection film formation solution preferably has a concentration ranging from 10 ppm to 30 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">With this arrangement, as long as the concentration of the water-soluble polymer in the protection film formation solution falls within the above range in the protection film formation step, the protection film can be formed on the polished surface of the silicon wafer to have a thickness to the extent that generation of the water mark defect can be inhibited. Moreover, as long as the concentration of the water-soluble polymer falls within the above concentration range, the amount of the water-soluble polymer remaining in the rough polishing cloth is small enough not to impair the rough polishing. Accordingly, the polishing rate is not drastically decreased also in the rough polishing in the next cycle. Further, as long as the concentration of the water-soluble polymer falls within the above concentration range, the thickness of the protection film formed on the polished surface of the silicon wafer in the protection film formation step is about several hundred A (several ten nm), which enables to remove the protection film formed on the surface of the wafer in a short time in the subsequent finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In the above aspect of the invention, the water-soluble polymer used in the protection film formation solution is preferably a polymer compound having a cellulose structure or a nonionic polymer compound. Specifically, the polymer compound having a cellulose structure is exemplified by hydroxyethylcellulose. Examples of the nonionic polymer compound include polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, and polyethylene oxide, among which one or a plurality of the polymer compound may be contained. By using such a water-soluble polymer, the protection film can easily be formed on the polished surface of the silicon wafer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">First, the support <b>32</b> is lowered, whereby the wafer W placed on the cleaning unit <b>21</b> is sucked and held by a wafer chuck (not shown) of the polishing head <b>4</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">First Polishing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The support <b>32</b> is lowered while the head rotary driving unit <b>33</b> rotates the polishing head <b>4</b>. While the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> is supplied onto the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>, the wafer W held by the polishing head <b>4</b> is brought into contact with the polishing surface of the rotating rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>. With this operation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>, the rough polishing is applied to the wafer W while the wafer W is pressed onto the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> in the presence of the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> may be a velour cloth or a suede cloth. It is desirable to select a relatively hard cloth in order to increase the polishing rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The first polishing step corresponds to the rough polishing step in the one-side polishing step and is performed in order to remove a native oxide film formed on a surface of the wafer W, leading to a removal of process damage on the surface of the wafer W. The rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> to be used in the first polishing step contains abrasive grains in order to increase the polishing rate. Examples of the abrasive grains include colloidal silica, ceria, diamond and alumina.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> contains no water-soluble polymer. Since the water-soluble polymer considerably decreases the polishing rate, it is not suitable that the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> requiring a high polishing rate contains the water-soluble polymer. However, as long as the water-soluble polymer falls within a concentration range in which no protection film W<b>1</b> is formed on a polished surface of the wafer W after being subjected to the rough polishing and the polishing rate is not impaired, a slight amount of the water-soluble polymer may be contained in order to inhibit aggregation of the abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">As the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b>, it is desirable to use an alkaline aqueous solution containing a main alkaline agent and having an adjusted pH ranging from 8 to 13. Representative examples of the alkaline agent include potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and piperazine. In addition, the alkaline aqueous solution is exemplified by an ammonium carbonate aqueous solution and an alkaline aqueous solution added with a specific amine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Other polishing conditions in the first polishing step include a polishing time, a rotation speed of the polishing head <b>4</b>, a contact pressure of the wafer W and the like and may be appropriately set depending on a desired polishing amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">After the first polishing step is finished, the supply of the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> is stopped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">Protection Film Formation Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, subsequent to the first polishing step, a protection film formation step is performed. The protection film formation step is performed in order to prevent the water mark defect from being generated on the polished surface of the wafer W typically in a transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the protection film formation step after the first polishing step, the protection film formation solution containing a water-soluble polymer is supplied onto the polishing surface of the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> while the polishing surface of the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> is in contact with the polished surface of the wafer W. With this operation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(B)</figref>, the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is brought into contact with the polished surface of the wafer W. By this contact, the protection film W<b>1</b> is formed on the polished surface of the wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">For performing the protection film formation step, when the support <b>32</b> is moved upward to separate the polished surface of the wafer W from the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>, the polished surface of the wafer W is exposed in the air. Since a dangling-bond defect is present on the polished surface, when the wafer W is delivered in the air to a polishing stage at a different unit (e.g., the first finish polishing unit <b>23</b>) from the rough polishing unit <b>22</b>, the water mark defect is formed on the surface of the wafer W due to contamination by particles floating in the air and/or a reaction with oxygen. The water mark defect formed at this stage turns out to be a micro concave defect after the wafer W is subjected to the epitaxial growth and is finally detected as a micro LPD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, in order to minimize the exposure in the air of the polished surface of the wafer W, it is preferable that the protection film formation step is performed on the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>, which is the same stage as the polishing stage where the first polishing step is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">When the protection film formation solution is brought into contact with the polished surface of the wafer W, the wafer W and the polishing stage may be rotated or halted. In order to form the protection film W<b>1</b> by reliably applying the protection film formation solution to a position corresponding to the center of the wafer W, it is desirable that the protection film formation solution is brought into contact with the polished surface of the wafer W while the wafer W and the polishing stage (i.e., the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>) are rotated in opposite directions. When both of the wafer W and the polishing stage are rotated while the wafer W is pressed onto the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>, the polished surface of the wafer W after being subjected to the rough polishing is polished by an etching operation by an alkaline component in the protection film formation solution and by a removal operation of an etching residue by the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b>. In other words, since the polishing of the polished surface of the wafer W proceeds in the absence of abrasive grains in the protection film formation step, process damage on the polished surface of the wafer W caused by abrasive grains in the first polishing step (i.e., the rough polishing) can be removed and a predetermined protection film W<b>1</b> is formed on the polished surface of the wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">Protection Film Formation Solution <b>225</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The water-soluble polymer contained in the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is preferably a polymer compound having a cellulose structure or a nonionic polymer compound. The polymer compound having a cellulose structure is exemplified by hydroxyethylcellulose. Examples of the nonionic polymer compound include polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, and polyethylene oxide. The water-soluble polymer is preferably in a form of a linear micelle with a hydrophobic group at one end and a hydrophilic group at the other end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The water-soluble polymer preferably has a concentration ranging from 10 ppm to 30 ppm. At less than 10 ppm, even when the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is brought into contact with the polished surface of the wafer W, the protection film W<b>1</b> enough for providing desired effects on the polished surface of the wafer W is possibly not formed. In this case, the water mark defect may be formed on the polished surface of the wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, at more than 30 ppm, a thickness of the protection film W<b>1</b> formed on the polished surface of the wafer W becomes too thick, so that the polishing time for removing the protection film W<b>1</b> may be increased in the subsequent second polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The protection film formation solution <b>225</b> preferably contains the alkaline liquid as a primary agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Just after the rough polishing, the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> is present in a space between the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> and the polished surface of the wafer W. Accordingly, the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is supplied to the space where the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> remains. When the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> contains no alkaline component, a large difference in pH is generated between the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> and the protection film formation solution <b>225</b>. Due to such a large difference, the components present in the space between the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> and the polished surface of the wafer W may agglomerate to each other. The agglomerated components may cause damage on the polished surface of the wafer W. Accordingly, pH of the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is preferably adjusted by adding a slight amount of an alkaline component (e.g., amine). In this arrangement, the kind of the alkaline component is not particularly limited as long as pH of the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> falls within a range from 10 to 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, in the protection film formation step, the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> preferably contains no abrasive grains since the process damage caused by abrasive grains in the first polishing step can be removed by proceeding the polishing of the polished surface of the wafer W in the absence of abrasive grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0019" num="0000">Protection Film W<b>1</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The protection film W<b>1</b> is an organic film formed by attaching the hydrophobic group of the water-soluble polymer to the polished surface of the wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The protection film W<b>1</b> preferably has a thickness ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. At the thickness falling within the above range, even when the wafer W is delivered in the air from the rough polishing unit <b>22</b> to the first finish polishing unit <b>23</b>, the polished surface can be prevented from contacting with the alkaline component caused by the rough polishing liquid <b>224</b> and oxygen in the air, so that the polished surface of the wafer W is not etched by these components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">By performing the protection film formation step as described above, the protection film W<b>1</b> is formed on the polished surface of the wafer W. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(C)</figref>, since the protection film W<b>1</b> is present on the polished surface of the wafer W, a typical generation of the water mark defect during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air in the transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">After the protection film formation step is finished, the supply of the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> is stopped and the rotation of the polishing head <b>4</b> is stopped.

The average diameter desirably ranges from 10 nm to 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">As the finish polishing liquid, it is desirable to use an alkaline aqueous solution containing a main alkaline agent and having an adjusted pH ranging from 8 to 13.

<heading id="h-0021">Advantage(s) of Embodiment(s)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, the following advantages are achievable by the above-described exemplary embodiment.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0105">(1) In the protection film formation step subsequent to the first polishing step, the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> containing the water-soluble polymer is brought into contact with the polished surface of the wafer W tri form the protection film W<b>1</b> on the polished surface.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0106">Accordingly, since the protection film W<b>1</b> prevents the polished surface from being exposed in the air, a reaction between the polished surface and oxygen in the air is inhibited. Moreover, the polished surface is free from being etched by the alkaline component remaining in the polishing liquid. Accordingly, in the one-side polishing step, generation of the water mark defect during the delivery of the silicon wafer in the air of the wafer W in the transition from the rough polishing to the finish polishing is reduced. Consequently, the micro concave defect caused by the water mark defect is reduced on the manufactured epitaxial silicon wafer.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0107">(2) The water-soluble polymer of the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> supplied in the protection film formation step remains in the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> used in the previous cycle. Accordingly, in the first polishing step in the next cycle, the rough polishing is performed with the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> in which the water-soluble polymer remains. In this case, the water-soluble polymer deteriorates a removability of the native oxide film, so that the removal of the native oxide film is delayed at the periphery of the wafer as compared with the center of the wafer. Consequently, an edge roll-off amount of the wafer W at the next and subsequent cycles is reducible.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0108">(3) The water-soluble polymer in the protection film formation solution <b>225</b> has the concentration ranging from 10 ppm to 30 ppm. Accordingly, the protection film W<b>1</b> is formed on the polished surface of the wafer W to have a thickness to the extent that generation of the water mark defect can be inhibited. Moreover, as long as the concentration of the water-soluble polymer falls within the above concentration range, the amount of the water-soluble polymer remaining in the rough polishing cloth <b>223</b> is small enough not to impair the rough polishing. Accordingly, the polishing rate is not drastically decreased also in the rough polishing in the next cycle.</li> </ul>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0122">The surface roughness Ra of the silicon wafer was measured by a surface roughness measurement device (manufactured by Chapman).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the number of the micro LPD generated on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer in each of Example 1, Example 2 and Comparative 1. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the surface roughness Ra of the silicon wafer in each of Example 1, Example 2 and Comparative 1. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref> show the maps of the LPD generated on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafers in Example 1, Example 2 and Comparative 1, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0124">As apparently understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the number of the micro LPD and the surface roughness Ra both tend to be decreased in Examples 1 and 2 where the protection film was formed as compared with Comparative 1 where the protection film was not formed after the first polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0125">In comparison between Example 1 and Example 2, the number of the micro LPD and the surface roughness Ra are both decreased in Example 2, Accordingly, it is inferred that use of the protection film formation solution having a high polymer concentration leads to formation of a protection film having a higher protection capability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0126">It is confirmed from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref> that the number of the micro LPD in each of Examples 1 and 2 is lower than that in Comparative 1 as a result of the substantial observation of the LPD generated on the surface of the epitaxial silicon wafer. It is inferred that this is caused by a decrease in the micro concave defect derived from the water mark defect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0127">Moreover, in comparison between Example 1 and Example 2, the number of the LPD is small in Example 2. Accordingly, it is inferred that the water mark defect has been sufficiently inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0128">Since the protection film formation solution used in Example 2 contains PEG as the water-soluble polymer, it is inferred from the results that the protection film formed of PEG exhibits a high passivation effect and a high etching stopper effect.</div>
<heading id="h-0027">Example 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0129">Silicon wafers were manufactured in the same manner as in Example 2 except that the epitaxial growth treatment was not performed, the protection film formation solution only containing PEG as the water-soluble polymer was used in the protection film formation step, and the PEG concentration in the protection film formation solution was adjusted. The polymer concentration was adjusted to 0 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 20 ppm, 30 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0130">With respect to the obtained silicon wafers, the number of the generated water mark, the polishing rate, and an edge profile and a surface profile of the wafer near the edge (edge roll-off: ERO) were measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0131">The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. It should be noted that an index value shown as the ordinate axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a relative value to the result when the solution with 0 ppm of the PEG concentration, in other words, the solution containing no PEG was used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0132">It is confirmed from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that, since the number of the generated water mark is decreased as the polymer concentration of the protection film formation solution is increased, the protection film formation solution having a higher polymer concentration exhibits a higher protection effect by the protection film to be able to prevent generation of the water mark.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0133">On the other hand, the results reveal that the polishing rate is decreased as the polymer concentration of the protection film formation solution is increased. It is inferred that this is because the polymer remains in the polishing cloth when the polymer concentration is high, resulting in a decrease in the polishing rate in the rough polishing at the next cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0134">The results reveal that the most suitable range of the polymer concentration of the protection film formation solution is from 10 ppm to 30 ppm, where the number of the generated water mark is small and the polishing rate is high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0135">Moreover, the results show that the edge roll-off is decreased as the polymer concentration of the protection film formation solution is increased. It is inferred that this is because the polymer remaining in the polishing cloth acts on the silicon water in the rough polishing at the next cycle to delay the removal of the native oxide film, thereby inhibiting the edge roll-off. It was confirmed that the edge roll-off was inhibited also in the most suitable range of the polymer concentration and the edge roll-off was further inhibited by performing the protection film formation step subsequent to the first polishing step to form the protection film on the polished surface.</div>
