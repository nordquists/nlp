<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor device fabrication usually involves many processes, including a rough polishing and/or a finish polishing for generating a smooth surface on a wafer. The finish polishing is usually performed using a slurry which often contains a mixture of minerals, sludge or other suitable materials dispersed in liquid. For example, the slurry contains colloidal silica which is a compound of amorphous anhydrous silicic acid in a colloidal state, and abrasive particles used for chemical-mechanical planarization/polishing (CMP).</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an example diagram showing a slurry-supplying system for chemical-mechanical planarization. The system <b>100</b> supplies a diluted slurry to a CMP apparatus <b>102</b> for chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a stock slurry (e.g., an undiluted slurry containing colloidal silica) is transferred from a source tank <b>104</b> to another source tank <b>106</b>, and then is provided from the source tank <b>106</b> to a mixing tank <b>108</b>. One or more diluents are added into the mixing tank <b>108</b> to dilute the stock slurry. The diluted slurry is then transferred to a supply tank <b>110</b> which supplies the diluted slurry to the CMP apparatus <b>102</b> for performing CMP on an article.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Specifically, the stock slurry is transferred from the source tank <b>104</b> to the source tank <b>108</b> using one or more liquid-delivery pumps <b>180</b>. For example, the stock slurry includes CeO<sub>2</sub>-based materials, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-based materials, SiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials, or other suitable materials. One or more mass flow controllers <b>112</b> are used to control flow rates of the stock slurry that flows from the source tank <b>104</b> to the source tank <b>106</b>. A filter (not shown) is placed between the source tank <b>104</b> and the source tank <b>106</b> to remove particles equal to or larger than a predetermined size from the stock slurry. One or more liquid-delivery pumps <b>182</b> are used to pressurize the stock slurry out of the source tank <b>106</b> toward the mixing tank <b>108</b>. The slurry is diluted at a predetermined proportion with one or more diluents (e.g., one or more chemical materials and/or pure water) in the mixing tank <b>108</b>. For example, concentrated ammonia water and pure water are introduced into the mixing tank <b>108</b> to mix with the slurry. A stirrer (not shown) may be used to stir and mix the slurry with the diluents. The diluted slurry is then transferred to the supply tank <b>110</b> using one or more liquid-delivery pumps <b>184</b>. An ultrasonic processing device (not shown) may be disposed in the supply tank <b>110</b> to process the diluted slurry, and one or more liquid-delivery pumps <b>186</b> are used to transfer the diluted slurry to the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>. Another filter (not shown) may be used after the liquid-delivery pumps <b>186</b> to filter the diluted slurry flowing out of the supply tank <b>110</b> to remove particles equal to or larger than a predetermined size before the diluted slurry is provided to the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">A wafer for semiconductor device fabrication is processed in the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>. To expedite the CMP process, oxidizers, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and potassium iodate (KIO<sub>3</sub>), may be added to the slurry in the mixing tank <b>108</b>. The oxidizers can react with certain materials (e.g., polymer materials) in the wafer so that the wafer is polished faster during the CMP process. However, adding the oxidizers in the mixing tank <b>108</b> has some disadvantages. For example, the oxidizers react with other chemical materials and/or the slurry in the mixing tank <b>108</b>, which negatively affects the chemical stability of the slurry. In another example, before the oxidizers can react with the wafer in the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>, the oxidizers are transferred to the supply tank <b>110</b> and then transferred to the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>. The oxidizers may degrade and decompose during such a long transferring process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example diagram of the CMP apparatus <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an oxidizer material <b>202</b> and a catalyst material <b>204</b> are introduced directly into the CMP apparatus <b>102</b> during a CMP process on a wafer (not shown). A plurality of radicals are generated based on the catalyst material <b>204</b> and the oxidizer material <b>202</b> and react with the wafer so as to expedite the CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically, the CMP apparatus <b>102</b> includes a polishing head <b>206</b>, a polishing pad <b>208</b>, a reactant distribution component <b>210</b>, and a slurry distribution component <b>214</b>. In certain embodiments, the polishing head <b>206</b> rotates and oscillates to bring the wafer (not shown) into contact with the polishing pad <b>208</b> that moves in the plane of the wafer surface to be planarized. A slurry (e.g., a diluted slurry) <b>212</b> is introduced on the polishing pad <b>208</b> through the slurry distribution component <b>214</b>. For example, the slurry <b>212</b> includes an abrasive and corrosive chemical solution (e.g., a colloid). Separately from the slurry <b>212</b>, the oxidizer material <b>202</b> and the catalyst material <b>204</b> are introduced on the polishing pad <b>208</b> through the reactant distribution component <b>210</b>. For example, the oxidizer material <b>202</b> includes hydrogen peroxide, and the catalyst material <b>204</b> includes an iron-based material. The oxidizer material <b>202</b> and the catalyst material <b>204</b> are introduced on the polishing pad <b>208</b> through two different conduits (e.g., pipes, tubes) respectively. The plurality of radicals are generated from the oxidizer material <b>202</b> with the assistance of the catalyst material <b>204</b> and react with certain materials (e.g., polymer materials) in the wafer (not shown) that is supported by the polishing pad <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, the CMP apparatus <b>102</b> further includes a light source <b>216</b> that emits an incident light (e.g., ultraviolet light) on the oxidizer material <b>202</b> for generation of the radicals. In certain embodiments, the CMP apparatus <b>102</b> further includes a controller <b>220</b> configured to control the polishing head <b>206</b>, the reactant distribution component <b>210</b>, and the slurry distribution component <b>214</b>. The polishing pad <b>208</b> may be attached to a polishing platen (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an example diagram for oxidization of the wafer. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, certain materials (e.g., polymer materials) in the wafer are oxidized by a plurality of radicals generated based on the oxidizer material <b>202</b> with the assistance of the catalyst material <b>204</b>. The products of the reaction between the radicals and the wafer (e.g., oxidized polymer materials) are removed during the CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the radicals are generated through Fenton's reactions. For example, ferrous irons (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) included the catalyst material <b>204</b> are oxidized by the oxidizer material <b>202</b> (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) to generate ferric irons (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and hydroxyl anions (OH<sup>−</sup>). Then, Ferric irons (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) react with the oxidizer material (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) to generate ferrous irons (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), superoxide radicals (HOO.), and protons (H<sup>+</sup>). The Fenton's reactions may include one or more of the following reactions:
<br/>
Fe<sup>2+</sup>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>→Fe<sup>3+</sup>+.OH+OH<sup>−</sup>
<br/>
Fe<sup>2+</sup>+.OH→Fe<sup>3+</sup>+OH<sup>−</sup>
<br/>
.OH+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>→HO<sub>2</sub>.+H<sub>2</sub>O
<br/>
Fe<sup>2+</sup>+HO<sub>2</sub>.→Fe(HO<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2+</sup>
<br/>
Fe<sup>3+</sup>+HO<sub>2</sub>.→Fe<sup>2+</sup>+O<sub>2</sub>+H<sup>+</sup>
<br/>
HO<sub>2</sub>.→O<sub>2</sub> <sup>−</sup>.+H<sup>+</sup>
<br/>
Fe<sup>3+</sup>+HO<sub>2</sub>.→Fe<sup>2+</sup>+O<sub>2</sub>+H<sup>+</sup>
<br/>
HO<sub>2</sub>.+HO<sub>2</sub>.→H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2 </sub>
<br/>
.OH+HO<sub>2</sub>.→H<sub>2</sub>O+O<sub>2 </sub>
<br/>
.OH+O<sub>2</sub>.→OH<sup>−</sup>+O<sub>2 </sub>
<br/>
.OH+.OH→H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The generated radicals engage in reactions (e.g., oxidation) with certain materials (e.g., polymer materials) of the wafer. For example, a polymer material (e.g., RH) reacts with the generated radicals (e.g., .OH) with the assistance of the catalyst material <b>204</b> to result in mainly carbon dioxide and water which are very easy to remove during the CMP process, as shown below:
<br/>
RH+.OH→R.+H<sub>2</sub>O
<br/>
R.+Fe<sup>3+</sup>→R<sup>+</sup>+Fe<sup>2+</sup>
<br/>
R<sup>+</sup>+O<sub>2</sub>→ROO<sup>+</sup>→ . . . →CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O
