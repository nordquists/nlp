<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, top and bottom sides of a semiconductor wafer are subjected to a plurality of stages of mirror-polishing. Specifically, the mirror-polishing is roughly divided into a rough polishing for enhancing the flatness of the semiconductor wafer, and a finish polishing for reducing the surface roughness of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, the mirror-polishing is not only applied to the top and bottom sides of the semiconductor wafer, but also to a chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer in order to prevent a generation of dust from the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The rough polishing is performed through a simultaneous double-sided polishing in which top and bottom sides of a semiconductor wafer received in a carrier are simultaneously polished. During the simultaneous double-sided polishing, the semiconductor wafer touches an inner circumferential surface of the carrier to cause scars and impressions on the chamfered portion. Accordingly, the mirror-polishing is applied to the chamfered portion after the rough polishing in order to remove the generated scars and impressions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the chamfered portion is mirror-polished in two stages including: a first step for polishing the chamfered portion using an unwoven fabric polishing pad and abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution; and a second step for finishing the polishing using a suede polishing pad and abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution. The first step is performed in order to highly efficiently remove the scars and impressions caused on the chamfered portion. The second step is performed in order to flatten minute surface roughness of the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since a soft polishing cloth is used as the polishing pad for mirror-polishing the chamfered portion, the soft polishing cloth is not only applied on the chamfered portion but also applied over the top and/or bottom side of the wafer during the progress of the polishing (sometimes referred to as an “over-polishing” hereinafter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Specifically, an oxide film <b>101</b>A present on a chamfered portion <b>101</b> of a semiconductor wafer <b>100</b> is removed in the first step as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, not only the oxide film <b>101</b>A present on the chamfered portion <b>101</b> but also an oxide film <b>102</b>B present at a part of the oxide film <b>102</b>A on a wafer surface <b>102</b>, to which a polishing cloth (unwoven fabric) <b>111</b> of the polishing pad is applied, is removed. Further, a stress is locally concentrated to a border portion <b>103</b> between the wafer surface <b>102</b> and the chamfered portion <b>101</b> which emerges by removing the oxide film <b>102</b>B, so that the polishing progresses around the border portion <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Next, subsequent to the first step, the oxide film <b>102</b>B present at a part of the wafer surface <b>102</b>, to which a polishing cloth (suede) <b>112</b> of the polishing pad is applied, is removed in the second step as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Then, a stress is locally applied to the border portion <b>103</b> between the exposed wafer surface <b>102</b> and the chamfered portion <b>101</b>, so that the polishing further progresses around the border portion <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The above-described over-polishing reduces the thickness of the outer peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer (sometimes referred to as an edge roll-off).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been disclosed that, in order to prevent the edge roll-off caused by the over-polishing, the polishing pad is formed by adhering at least two layers including a polishing cloth layer and a sponge layer whose hardness is lower than that of the polishing cloth layer, and the hardness of the polishing cloth layer is set at 40 or less in ASKER C hardness (see, for instance, Patent Literature 1). In Patent Literature 1, the width of the over-polishing can be reduced to 400 μm or less with the use of the above-structured polishing pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Another manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer has been disclosed, in which a resin protection film is formed on top and bottom sides of a semiconductor wafer after a double-sided polishing, a mirror-finish chamfering step is performed, and subsequently the resin protection film is removed (see, for instance, Patent Literature 2). In Patent Literature 2, the resin protection film formed on the top and bottom sides of the semiconductor wafer restrains the over-polishing during the mirror-finish chamfering step to prevent the edge roll-off.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Problem(s) to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">However, since the hardness of the polishing cloth layer in contact with the wafer is increased to restrain the wafer from sinking into the polishing pad in Patent Literature 1, though the over-polishing can be restrained, microroughness on the chamfered portion is deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The method disclosed in Patent Literature 2 requires washing processes each for forming the resin protection film and for removing the resin protection film, so that the production cost increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, when the resin for forming the protection film extends not only to both of the top and bottom sides but also to the chamfered portion, the chamfered portion is partially or entirely restrained from being polished during the mirror-polishing step. Accordingly, it is necessary to accurately form the protection film only on the top and bottom sides of the wafer so as to keep the resin from being applied to the chamfered portion, which, however, is technically difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, when the wafer is washed for removing the resin protection film, the resin once removed is sometimes adhered again and the resin protection film may not be completely removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the invention is to provide a manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer capable of enhancing a flatness on the outer peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer and simultaneously capable of flattening the roughness on a chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer during the mirror chamfer polishing.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problem(s)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer according to an aspect of the invention is for a semiconductor wafer including a top side, a bottom side, a chamfered portion and an oxide film, the oxide film being provided on the top side or on the top and bottom sides and not provided on the chamfered portion, the method including: applying a mirror-finishing chamfer polishing to the chamfered portion using a abrasive-grain-free polishing solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the above aspect of the invention, the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing is applied using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution to the semiconductor wafer having the oxide film on the top side or the top and bottom sides and having no oxide film on the chamfered portion. Since the oxide film is not removed by the polishing using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution, the area in which the oxide film is present (i.e. the top side or the top and bottom sides of the wafer) is not polished but the polishing progresses only on the chamfered portion at which no oxide film is present. Accordingly, even when the wafer is polished while the polishing pad is applied not only on the chamfered portion but also on the top side or the top and bottom sides, the oxide film present on the top side or the top and bottom sides serves as a stopper to prevent the occurrence of the over-polishing. Consequently, the flatness of the outer peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer can be enhanced, while flattening the roughness on the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer according to the above aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the method includes, prior to the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing, applying a pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing to the chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer comprising the oxide film on the top side or on the top and bottom sides and on the chamfered portion using an abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the above arrangement, prior to the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing, the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution is performed. The oxide film can be removed through the polishing using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution. Accordingly, by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing to the chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer having the oxide film not only on the top side or the top and bottom sides but also on the chamfered portion, the oxide film on the chamfered portion is removed. Consequently, the semiconductor wafer having the oxide film on the top side or the top and bottom sides and having no oxide film on the chamfered portion can be produced by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing. Further, the scars and impressions generated on the chamfered portion can be more efficiently removed by the polishing using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution than the polishing using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution. Accordingly, the efficiency of the subsequent process (i.e. the mirror-finish chamfer polishing) can be enhanced by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In the manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer according to the above aspect of the invention, it is preferable that an unwoven fabric of less than 7% of a compression rate is used for a polishing pad used in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing, and suede of 6% or more of the compression rate is used for the polishing pad used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">An unwoven fabric of less than 7% of the compression rate is used for the polishing pad used in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing, and suede of 6% or more of the compression rate is used for the polishing pad used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing. Since the compression rates of the polishing pads used in the above steps are defined as a specific combination, the over-polishing can be more reliably restrained in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing and the roughness of the chamfered portion can be more reduced in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In the manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer according to the above aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution used in the mirror chamfer polishing comprises a polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the above arrangement, the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution used in the mirror chamfer polishing is added with a polymer. Since the polymer is added to the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution, the wettability of the semiconductor wafer during the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing can be enhanced.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplary embodiment(s) of the invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In the manufacturing method of a semiconductor wafer of the exemplary embodiment, a monocrystal ingot pulled up using Czochralski method and the like is initially sliced with a multi-wire saw and the like. Subsequently, in order to prevent breakage and crack of the sliced wafer, peripheral edges of the wafer are chamfered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, in order to make the chamfered wafer surface flat, the wafer is subjected to lapping and surface grinding. Then, in order to remove a work affected layer generated on the wafer and generated during the chamfering and lapping, the wafer is subjected to a chemical surface layer removal process through etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, the etched top and bottom sides of the wafer are subjected to a rough polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The rough polishing is applied in order to polish the wafer to a desired thickness. Specifically, a double-sided polishing machine and a polishing cloth of a hard material (e.g. solidified urethane resin) are used to polish the wafer at a relatively high polishing speed in order to reduce the deviations in the wafer thickness (i.e. to make the wafer flat) after being polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the wafer is washed in order to remove residual matters (e.g. abrasive grains and polishing solution used in the rough polishing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">It is favorable to use a washing solution (SC-1) containing ammonia water and hydrogen peroxide water during the washing process. It is especially favorable to wash the wafer through a wet bench washing using an SC-1 solution heated to 50 to 80 degrees C., the solution being prepared by mixing ammonia water and hydrogen peroxide water at a ratio of 1:1 and diluting the mixture with pure water to 5 to 30 times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">After being washed using the SC-1 solution, the wafer is rinsed with pure water. A natural oxide film whose thickness is in a range of approximately 1 nm to 1.1 nm (approximately 10 angstrom to 11 angstrom) is inevitably formed on the entire surface of the washed wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Pre-Finish Mirror Chamfer Polishing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing is applied to the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> (sometimes simply referred to as “wafer” hereinafter) having an oxide film <b>12</b>A formed on a wafer top side <b>12</b> and an oxide film <b>11</b>A formed on the chamfered portion <b>11</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The wafer suction unit <b>21</b> includes a suction stage <b>211</b> (holder) configured to hold the lower side of the wafer <b>10</b> by suction, and a rotor <b>212</b> configured to rotate the suction stage <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The polishing unit <b>22</b> includes a polishing wheel <b>221</b> configured to mirror-polish the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b> and a drive unit (not shown) configured to rotate the polishing wheel <b>221</b>, vertically move the polishing wheel <b>221</b> and press the polishing wheel <b>221</b> against the wafer <b>10</b>. The polishing wheel <b>221</b> includes an upper-slant polishing pad <b>222</b>, a vertical-surface polishing pad <b>223</b> and a lower-slant polishing pad <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that the polishing pads <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> are shown to be on the right side in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> for the convenience of explanation of a positional relationship with respect to the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b>. The polishing pads <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> are each actually formed in an arc of the same length and are spaced apart at predetermined intervals around the wafer <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Each of the polishing pads <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> are attached with a polishing cloth.

The polishing pad used in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing is preferably as hard as possible. Specifically, the polishing cloth used for the polishing pad in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing is preferably an unwoven fabric whose compression rate is less than 7%.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the effects of the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing using the above-described chamfer-polishing machine <b>20</b> will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Initially, the lower side of the wafer <b>10</b> is sucked by the wafer suction unit <b>21</b> to hold the wafer <b>10</b>. Then, each of the polishing pads <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> of the polishing wheel <b>221</b> is pressed against and is kept pressed by a predetermined pressure at the corresponding part of the chamfered portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, while supplying the polishing solution from the pipe <b>23</b> to each of the polishing pads, the rotor <b>212</b> is rotated to rotate the wafer <b>10</b> and, simultaneously, the polishing wheel <b>221</b> is rotated by the drive unit to rotate each of the polishing pads <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the above arrangement, the upper part of the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b> is polished by the upper-slant polishing pad <b>222</b>, the central part of the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is polished by the vertical-surface polishing pad <b>223</b> and the lower part of the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is polished by the lower-slant polishing pad <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, since the polishing pad uses a polishing cloth (unwoven fabric) <b>222</b>A with a high hardness in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing, the wafer <b>10</b> is kept from being sunk into the polishing pad during the polishing. Accordingly, the polishing cloth (unwoven fabric) <b>222</b>A of the polishing pad is restrained from being applied onto the wafer top side <b>12</b> beyond the chamfered portion <b>11</b>. As a result, the over-polishing is kept from being caused during the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing but only the oxide film <b>11</b>A present on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is removed. Thus, the wafer <b>10</b> having the oxide film <b>12</b>A on the top and bottom sides thereof and having no oxide film on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is produced. Further, the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing removes the scars and impressions caused during the rough polishing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The polishing pad used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing preferably has a hardness as low as possible. Specifically, the polishing cloth used for the polishing pad in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing is preferably suede whose compression rate is 6% or more. Especially preferable example of the suede is SUPREME-RN manufactured by Nitta Haas Incorporated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The polishing solution used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing is preferably an alkaline aqueous solution containing no abrasive grains.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Since the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution is used, the polishing only on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> at which no oxide film is present progresses in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In other words, even when the polishing cloth (suede) <b>222</b>B of the polishing pad is applied on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or a backside of the wafer while polishing, since the oxide film cannot be polished with the use of the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution, the over-polishing does not occur but the roughness of only the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is flattened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">After finishing the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing, the oxide film <b>12</b>A present on the wafer top side <b>12</b> is removed using a single-side polishing machine to mirror-finish the top side or top and bottom sides of the wafer <b>10</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">(1) The mirror-finishing chamfer polishing is applied using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution to the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b> having the oxide film <b>12</b>A on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides and having no oxide film on the chamfered portion <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the above arrangement, since the oxide film is not removed by the polishing using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution, the polishing does not progress on the area in which the oxide film is present (i.e. the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides of the wafer) but the polishing progresses only on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> at which no oxide film is present. Accordingly, even when the wafer is polished while the polishing cloth (suede) <b>222</b>B of the polishing pad is applied not only on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> but also on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides, the oxide film <b>12</b>A present on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides serves as a stopper to prevent the occurrence of the over-polishing. Consequently, the flatness of the outer peripheral portion of the wafer <b>10</b> can be enhanced, while flattening the roughness of the chamfered portion <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">(2) The pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing is applied using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution to the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b> having the oxide film <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides and the chamfered portion <b>11</b> prior to the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">According to the above arrangement, the oxide film can be removed through the polishing using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution. Consequently, by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing to the chamfered portion <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b> at which the oxide film <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A is present not only on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides but also on the chamfered portion <b>11</b>, the oxide film <b>11</b>A present on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is removed. Consequently, the wafer <b>10</b> having the oxide film <b>12</b>A on the wafer top side <b>12</b> or the top and bottom sides and having no oxide film on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> is produced by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing. Further, the scars and impressions generated on the chamfered portion <b>11</b> can be more efficiently removed by the polishing using the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution than the polishing using the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution. Accordingly, the efficiency of the subsequent process (i.e. the mirror-finish chamfer polishing) can be enhanced by applying the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">(3) An unwoven fabric of less than 7% of the compression rate is used for the polishing pad used in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing, and suede of 6% or more of the compression rate is used for the polishing pad used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">According to the above arrangement, since the compression rates and the like of the polishing pads used in the above steps are defined as a specific combination, the over-polishing can be more reliably restrained in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing and the roughness of the chamfered portion can be more reduced in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">(4) The abrasive-grain-free polishing solution used in the mirror chamfer polishing is added with a polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the above arrangement, since the polymer is added to the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution, the wettability of the semiconductor wafer during the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing can be enhanced.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Modification(s)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">It should be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the above exemplary embodiment but includes various improvements and modifications in design as long as such improvements and modifications are compatible with an object of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Though a polymer is added to the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution used in the mirror-finishing chamfer polishing in the above exemplary embodiment, a polymer may be added to the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, though the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing is performed in order to remove the oxide film on the chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer in the exemplary embodiment, such an arrangement is not exhaustive. For instance, a semiconductor wafer having no oxide film on the chamfered portion may be provided by forming the oxide film while the chamfered portion is masked and subsequently removing the mask. Alternatively, a semiconductor wafer having no oxide film on the chamfered portion may be provided by forming the oxide film on the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer and removing only the oxide film on the chamfered portion of the semiconductor wafer by, for instance, etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Though the oxide film formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer is formed during the washing process, the oxide film may be formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor wafer using a chemical solution. According to the above arrangement, unlike the natural oxide film, the thickness of the oxide film can be appropriately adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The polishing pad used in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing may be as hard as possible. By increasing the hardness of the polishing pad in the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing, the wafer is kept from being sunk into the polishing pad. Consequently, since the polishing pad is restrained from being applied over the top side or top and bottom sides of the wafer (i.e. not only to the chamfered portion), the over-polishing during the pre-finish mirror chamfer polishing can be restrained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The specific procedure(s) and design(s) in implementing the invention may be modified as long as such modification(s) are compatible with an object of the invention.</div>

However, it should be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited by the Examples and Comparative Examples.</div>
<heading id="h-0016">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Initially, the semiconductor wafer <b>10</b> in a form of a silicon wafer of a 300 mm diameter and crystal orientation (100) and having a 0.9 nm-thick natural oxide film formed on the entire surface was prepared by sequentially performing the steps of slicing, chamfering, lapping, etching, double-sided polishing and washing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">A silicon wafer was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the conditions for mirror-chamfer polishing were changed as follows.

<heading id="h-0019">Comparative Example 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">A silicon wafer was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the conditions for mirror-chamfer polishing were changed as follows. In the same manner as the above Comparative Example 2, a single-stage mirror polishing was performed in Comparative Example 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Polishing pad: including a polishing cloth made of an unwoven fabric (compression rate: 4.1%)</div>

<heading id="h-0020">Evaluations</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">A plurality of silicon wafers having been subjected to the mirror chamfer polishing obtained in Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1-3 were prepared. FZDD (Frontside_ZDD) (second order differential value of surface profile) of each of these silicon wafers was calculated using a flatness measuring machine (Wafer-Sight2 manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation). The FZDD is a scale of a magnitude of the edge roll-off. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, the microroughness of the chamfered portion of these silicon wafers was measured using a laser interferometer (manufactured by Chapman Instruments, Inc.). The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">As is clear from the results of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution is used for finish polishing, the edge roll-off is considerably deteriorated. On the other hand, as is clear from the results of Comparative Example 3 and Example 1, when the abrasive-grain-free polishing solution is used for finish polishing, the edge roll-off is not deteriorated. Further, from the results of Comparative Examples 2 and 3, it is found that, the edge roll-off is more reduced by using an unwoven fabric whose compression rate is lower (i.e. with higher hardness) as the polishing cloth of the polishing pad when the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution is used for polishing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As is clear from the results of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the microroughness increases in a single-stage mirror chamfer polishing with the use of the abrasive-grain-containing polishing solution and an unwoven fabric for the polishing cloth of the polishing pad. On the other hand, as is clear from the results of Comparative Example 1 and Example 1, the microroughness of the chamfered portion, which is considerably large in the polishing in the first step, can be significantly reduced in a two-stage mirror chamfer polishing with the use of suede as the polishing cloth for the polishing pad in the second step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">From the results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, it is found that the edge roll-off can be restrained and the roughness at the chamfered portion can be flattened in Example 1 according to the invention.</div>
