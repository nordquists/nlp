<div class="description-paragraph">°,oo The set of rules may further provide for one or more points to be scored by or deducted from one or other team as a result of an error in play on the part of that and/or the a other team.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following description refers to a preferred 0 embodiment of the apparatus and ball game of the present invention. To facilitate an understanding of the invention, reference is made in the description to the accompanying drawings where the epparatus is illustrated. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment as hereinafter described and as illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the drawings: Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view showing part 'f the apparatus of the present invention; 39 Fig. 2 is a schematic top plan view of the apparatus of JS -4-</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I-</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">.0 Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a detailed perspective view of a portion of the apparatus of Fig. 1; Fig. 4 is a perspective view of another part of the apparatus of the present invention; and, Fig. 5 is a perpsective view of an alternative other part of the apparatus of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring initially to Figs. 1 and 2, there is illustrated much of apparatus 1, used for playing the indoor ball game. Apparatus 1, includes playing arena 2, having playing area 3, surrounded by wall means 4. Wall means 4, defines the outline of a triangular playing area 3, and includes three boundary side walls 5,6,7, erected on area 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Those boundary walls 5,6,7, may be removably so erected, so that apparatus 1, may be generally dismantled when the game is not being played. Walls 5,6,7, are generally flexible so that they can act to stop a ball with minimal rebound during game play. Such walls 5,6,7, may also minimise player injury when contacted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">S 26 Boundary walls 5,6,7, are illustrated in further detail in Fig. 3 and may be composed of flexible sheet material Sj suspended and held taut above playing area 3. That suspension may be from a support structure (not illustrated), which in the example application may be part of a building in which So apparatus 1, is housed. Suspension may be from top edge 8, of I boundary walls 5,6,7, whilst bottom edge 9, thereof may be secured against playing area 3. Further support for walls 5,6,7, may be provided by support posts 10, particularly located at corners formed between juxtaposed walls As illustrated, the flexible sheet material of walls 5,6,7, may be in the nature of webbing or netting. Openings within that material Should be sufficiently small to prevent the passage 6 of a ball therethrough during game play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Boundary walls 5,6,7, may be of any suitable length and height. Two adjacent walls 5,6, may be of equal length and relatively long, whilst remaining wall 7, may be of a relatively shorter length. Thus, walls 5,6,7, may provide playing area 3, with a shape of an isosceles triangle. All 39 boundary walls 5,6,7, may be of the same height although in I this embodiment walls 5,6, will slope upwardly along top edge 8, thereof toward wall 7. In the example application of apparatus 1, walls 5,6, may be about 30 metres long, and increasing in height from about 4.2 to 6 metres, and wall 7, about 20 metres long, and about 6 metres high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although not illustrated, playing area 3, may be generally covered over with a top wall extending between top edges 8, of boundary side walls 5,6,7. That top wall may be provided by a ceiling of the building housing apparatus 1, of flexible sheet material the same or similar to that providing boundary side walls 5,6,7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Playing area 3, may be provided on a foundation of any suitable construction, and have a playing surface of suitable material. In the example application of apparatus 1, the foundation is provided by a building floor, which may be constructed of concrete, timber, or synthetic grass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternative playing areas 3, are envisaged, particularly wh-re apparatus 1, is located outdoors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Located on playing area 3, is games track 11, provided ao with three track bases 12,13,14, spaced apart therealong.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Games track 11, and track bases 12,13,14, are marked on or in playing area 3. That marking may be achieved by painting thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Games track 11, is triangular in shape, thereby providing three straight track sections 15,16,17, °o interconnecting bases 12,13,14, at apexes of track 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conveniently, the track shape is the same as, but c proportionately smaller than, the playing area shape in the oioo*° sense of having two adjacent rack sections 15,17, (the side</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">track sections) of equal longer length and remaining track section 16, (the end track section) of relatively shorter length. Moreover, games track 11, has an orientation corresponding to that of playing area 3, and is located toward the playing area apex formed between longer boundary side walls 5,6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Track sections 15,16,17, are of any suitable length having regard to size of playing area 3. In the example application of apparatus 1, the side track sections 15,17, may 39 be about 12 metres long, whilst the end track section may be b about 8 metres long. Track 11, may be located so that the apex between side track sections 15,17, is about 5 metres from the apex between side walls 5,6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Track bases 12,13,14, may be of any suitable size. In the example application of apparatus 1, bases 12,13,14, may each be quadrangular or triangular and have side lengths of about 450 millimetres.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Games track 11, may have safety zones 18, adjacent track bases 12,13,14, in which a batting game player running along track 11, is "safe" during the game. To that end, track 11, may have pairs of crease lines 19, extending across track 11, adjacent each of bases 12,13,14, safety zones 18, extending between crease lines 19, of each pair through adjacent base 12,13,14, Crease lines 19, may be marked on or in the playing area 3. That may be achieved by painting crease lines 19, on area 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">i Apparatus 1, also includes at least one pitching base in playing area 3, at which a game player is located for pitching a ball during game play. As illustrated two such bases 20, may be provided for, use by players of different game skill levels. Pitching bases 20, are located between games track 11, and boundary wall 7. Thus, pitching bases may be located between track section 16, and boundary side wall 7, and are located on an imaginary line etending from track base 12, and generally bisecting triangular games track Pitching bases 20, may be located at any suitable distance from track base 12, having regard to the overall size of playing area 3. That distance may vary between games, so that the distance may be greater for games between more Si* experienced players. In the example application of apparatus S 1, that distance miy be from about 14 to 18 metres.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Pitching bases 20, are marked on or in playing area 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That may be achieved by painting bases 20, thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Arena 2, is provided with core zones 21,22,23,24, so that when a ball strikes any one of those zones scores are allocated. Those zones 21,22,23,24, are provided on 'inner surfaces of walls 5,6,7, and are conveniently marked with 39 lines 25, on the wall inner surfaces and/or on playing area -7- .I 1111~ 3. Thus, zones 21, and 22, each extends partly along both side walls 5,6, between edges 9, and 10, zone 23, extends partly along both side walls 5,6, between edges 9, and 10, as well as entirely along side wall 7, from bottom edge 9, toward top edge 8, where zone 24, is located.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Score zones 21,22,23,24, may be of any suitable shape and size having regard to the shape and size of walls 5,6,7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It should be appreciated that other and/or alternative score zones may be provided, and may include for example, regions of playing area 3, between base 12, and the apex between walls 5,6, and between various ones of bases 12,13,14. Still other score zones may include specific areas along boundary side walls 5,6,7, those areas being limited to certain heights above playing area 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ball game of the present invention is played with a bat and ball. That bat and ball may be of any conventional type suitable for playing a ball game in a confined arena as described above, for example, a bat as used in baseball, softball, or cricket and a b31l as used in tennis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, specifically aeveloped bats and balls may be used. Two embodiments of such bats are illustrated in Figs. 4 S and Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate bats 26, each having short cylindrical handle portion 27, and generally flatened striking I portion 28. Striking portion 28, has striking surface 29, with which a ball is struck during game play. Striking surface 29, is slightly convex, and may increasingly taper in o a direction away from handle portion 27. Bat 26, may be composed of any suitable material, such as wood, metal, or plastic. During game play, bat 26, may be held upright in fr readiness for striking a pitched ball, in the manner of a i softball or baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A ball game using apparatus 1, as outlined above is played between two opposing teams, typically each of six players, according to a set of rules. Designation of batting and pitching teams may be achieved through any equitable manner, such as through the toss of a coin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The set of rules provides for the batting team to have 39 two batting innings, the innings alternating between the Liteams. During each batting innings, half of the batting team (active players) bat together. Those players of the batting team not batting in any one innings (passive players) wait outside arena 2. Each batting innings, is limited to a predetermined number of balls pitched by the pitching team, for example 36 balls. All active players of the batting team play together throughout the entire innings of that half team, so that there is not the sequential batting as each player goes "out" usually associated with bat and ball games; there is no "out" player in the usual sense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the rules, when actually batting each active player of the batting team is permitted to stand on track base 12, and receive balls pitched from one pitching base 20, by a player of the pitching team. The other two active batting players of that team, while not batting, stand Son track base 13, and 14, respectively. When a fairly pitched ball is correctly struck by the actually batting active player, all active players may or must (depending on the L rules) run along games track 11, to successive bases 12,13,14. During each run those players may run only to the next successive base 12,13,14, thereby bringing the active C C batting players to base 12, in succession. Only one active batting player may stop on any bases 12,13,14, at any one time, thus all active players are required to move along track o~ Ii, together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">oo The rules provide that an active batting player who correctly strikes a fairly pitched ball and runs to reach base S13, safely shall be credited one or more score points according to the point value allocated to the scoring zone 6 6 21,22,23,24, that the ball may have first hit (either directly off the bat or indirectly such as off playing area In addition, those players may be credited with one or more additional points, according to the rules, should they subsequently advance from base 13, through base 14, back to base 12. At least one score zone, such as zone 24, may be further distinguished as a bonus score zone by the rules in that, when a struck ball first hits that zone, all ",ctive batting players may freely walk to the next successive base 39 12,13,14, with the active player achieving that zone hit being -9- L credited with the point value of that zone 24.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The set of rules provide for the pitching team to have two pitching innings during which each player in turn pitches the ball from pitching base 20, to a batting player at track base 12, and fields the ball. During each innings, all players of the pitching team are positioned on playing area 3, and attempt to prevent the bai;tir,ig team players from scoring points. The pitching team players may be arranged on playing area 3, so that one player is on pitching base 20, separate players are adjacent each of track bases 12,13,14, and the remaining players are on playing area 3, remote from games track 11. The rules may require curtain pitching player placement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When pitching during a game, each player is permitted to pitch a predetermined number of balls, for example, twelve balls subdivided into two non-consecutive six ball overs, one over being pitrhed during each batting team innings. A fairly pitched ball may be thrown underarm from closer pitching base or overarm from more remote pitching base 20, according to 0 the rules. Moreover, a fairly pitched ball may not bounce or hit a boundary side wall 5,6,7, or top wall, before reaching the batting player at base 12, According to the rules a fairly pitched ball is required to pass over base 12, batwss the batting player's knees and shoulders when in a natural I batting stance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">0' The set of rules provides for the teams to have score points deducted as a result of errors of play by that team, t oo when batting and/or pitching. Thus, for example, the batting team may have one or more points deducted where an active player when batting does not swing and attempt to strike a c: fairly pitched ball, and a predetermined (such as three) balls are fairly pitched to the same active player without the ball being struck. In addition, batting team points may be deducted where a struck ball is fielded and held by a pitching team player standing on one of track bases 12,13,14, before an approaching active player of the batting team reaches that base 12,13,14, and where a struck ball is caught by a pitching team player before that ball touches playing area 3, whether 39 or not the ball has previously struck side walls 5,6,7, or the top wall. Batting team score points may also be deducted where a player of that team interferes with the fielding of any ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The set of rules provides for the teams to score points as penalties resulting from errors of play by the other team when batting and/or pitching. Thus, for example, the batting team may score one or more points where a ball nr succession of balls are not fairly pitched by the pitching team, the pitching team players are not properly positioned un area 3, a 1 0 pitched ball strikes an active player when at base 12, the pitching team players interfere with the active players when actually batting and running along games track 11, through a misfielding of the ball, and the pitching team are not generally playing within the "spirit of the game".</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The rules may provide for an umpire to adjudicate during o a game. That umpire may be positioned on playing surface 3, between base 12, and apex between side walls 5,6, in a non-score or foul zone. The umpire may score points for or against the opposing teams for any number of predetermined reasons, such as abuse of game apparatus, dangerous game play, kicking the ball, foul play, or any unbecoming action.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SThe set of rules may further include usual guidelines to achieve orderly game play as will be well appreciated by those skilled in this art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I The apparatus of the present invention provides &amp;n exciting ball game that can be played indoors between opposing teams of players. That game can simulate softball, baseball O and like games and provide player and spectator enjoyment traditionally associated with such games.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">3 Finally, it is to be appreciated that various modifications and/or alterations may be made to the apparatus without departing from the ambit of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto.</div>
