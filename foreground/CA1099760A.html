<div class="description-paragraph" num="1"> I<br/> <br/>                                BAC~G'ROUND OF THE IMVENTION <br/> <br/> 1~                   It is ~ell known that the game .of golf has ~achieved .          steadily increasing popularity in recent years to the polnt ~here it is now enjoyed by a substantial proportlon of~the population ln..                             ~ost of the more civilized countries    ~.<br/>1   of the world. Inasmuch as the'game requires' a.great deal Qf space, it.~must be: played out of doors and, therefore, .l             is plaDed, for the most part, only during the'late spring,  :<br/>summer and early fall in those portions of the world sub;ect to severe winters.  For this reason expensive golf courses~ are largely unused during the winter: months ;   :   ~ln such~are:as~and people who are.'devoted to the game must .  ~seek oth.er f'orms :o~ exercise and:rec~reation.  ~In~the ~<br/>: northern United~States and p~arts :oP~Canada a: game 'calle~d :   ;:paddle ball:has ~gained s:ome lntercst as a winter substitute    :<br/>~        for:golf, b:ut it has little :appeal ~or manD golfers since .~   it is entirely unlike th.e game of golf. It has long been : apparent, therefore, that a~need has existed for a game      .<br/>; ~ similar to golf that.would~provide~exercise and recreation ~or golfers~in the winter time and an economic u~se for    :<br/>:   :: :  golf courises ~reviously closed during that se~ason.<br/> ;',`~ : : ': ~<br/>        : ~ ~                  ~ THE PRI~OR'ART<br/>                     `        :<br/>A wide~variety of racket or:paddle and ball ga~es are known whlch can be played outdoors besides the paddle :    ball game referred:to above.  In addition, Wintersteen U.S. patent 3,506,26.6 issued April 14~ 1970 describes a    . <br/> <br/> ``:: ~ :        ::                :                ~<br/> <br/>                                               .: <br/> <br/> tO~37~                                                                        , paddle and ball game in which the object is to hit a ball through a hole in a backboard in a device which then returns the ball alternately ln one directlon and then the other.<br/>Similarly, De Master U.S. patent 2,021,989 issued November 26, 1935 describes a ball tossing game employing an upright but inclined back step having a hole through'which`to                    f thro~ a ball and a ball receiving bag, all for use in practicing throwing a baseball~ Kriekord U.S. patent </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="2">2,201,B65 issued May 21, lglio also relates to a baseball pitcher's target apparatus having a backboard with a rectangular ball passing aperture and a bag for receiving the balls thrown through the aperture. Seibold U.S.<br/>patent 1,392,662 lssued October 4~ 1921 discloses a basket on three legs ~for receiving a ball propelled by a bat in a game of skill.<br/>      Benjamin U.S. patent 3,674,270 issued July 4, 1972 describes a basket game utilizing a convexly shaped paddle and an irregularly shaped ball; the random shapes of the ball and paddles being intended to lend unpredict-ability to the game and thus guarantee that each`participant   3 obtains a great deal of exercise in achieving a goal.<br/>     Demaline U.S. patent 2,993,696 issued July 25, 1961 describes an outdoor game in whi'ch a feathe'red projectile like a dark but having a knob in place of the point, is placed on a fulcrum block on the ground and then driven     3 into the air by a bent ended club. The goal is a dished cup into which the projectile is ultimately played. A<br/>similar game described in Tiikkainen U.S. patent 3,o73,598 employs a mound shaped supporting member on which a pro-     3 jectile is placed before being struck by an elongated club. <br/> <br/> The proJectile has an elongated tubular body enveloped in a central portion between the ends of the tube by either a perforated ball like structure or a double conical structure.    ~   "`' The club telescopes to provide a club of varying length for shots of different lengths so as to correspond in a single club to a f'ull set of golf clubs.  The goal is a ring supported on three legs.<br/>     Atchison U.S. patent 3,348,8116 issued October 24, 1967 describes golf' game receptacles of. varying sizes and helghts above th.e ground consisting of a ring defining a horizontal plane, a net depending from the ring and a leg to be stuck into the ground.<br/>    Romeo U.S. patent 3,558,140 issued January 26, 1971 describes a golfing target including a vertical frame having a sheetlike member attached to it to display a simulated golf green.  The sheetlike member has a slit along the lower and side boundaries of the simulated golf green so that a golf ball driven into the simulated golf green passes through the slit and: falls into a structure which delivers the ball onto a second horizontally disposed simulated golf green where the player may then putt the ball into a hole.<br/>   It ~ill be seen from the foregoing prior art that wh.ile games. exist for possible winter time play which employ paddles or clubs, a ball, and target devices in which a ball passes through a hole in a hackstop, none of these games affords a challenge similar to that of golf', as is evidenced by the fact that none have achieved even remotely comparable popularity. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="3">-3-~Qg~60 ,, It is an object of the present invention, therefore, ¦~ to provide a game similar to golf which can be played ,¦ not only in the warmer months but even under wintry con-                                       I<br/>~! ditions when the tees, fairways and greens o~ the golf                                      3 course are frozen too hard to permit a ball to be teed on            J<br/>~¦ the teeing ground, struck without club damage on the ¦ fairway, or putted truly on the green.<br/>I                    It is another object of the invention to provide a game which may be played outdoors on a golf course in the winter time, so long as the snow is not too deep and 3 soft to permit finding the ball, which will thus make it economically advantageous to keep golf courses open during the winter where they are normally closed and unproductive I  of income.<br/>¦        It is another object of the invention ~o provide a game which may be played all year around on three levels 3 i.e. as a serious sport, as a casual game, or as a child's ¦  pastime.<br/>¦                      It is still another object of the invention to provide suitable apparatus for the aforesaid sport, game and pastime. I<br/>It is yet another object of the inventicn to provide    3 a new game, pIayable outdoors in the winter on a bare, frozen golf course which is very similar to golf and which    3 provides similar physical and metal challenges as well as a comparable amount of exercise.                 3 !I         SUMMARY O~ THE IN~ENTIOM<br/>:~                                 , I         . 1.<br/>ll         The foregoing and other objects of the invention :           311                                                   , ~hich will become apparent hereinafter~ are achieved by providing game apparatus including a playing surface which may be a golf course or any other outdoor area, balls and bats of novel type, and at least one ring screen as a target and recep~acle for the ball after it is driven by`<br/>the bat ln one or more stro~es.  While the game may be played on a small scale in the player's bac~ yard, for example, or any other suitable area, in its fullest development it is played on an existing golf course utilizing the entire course either making use of the regular 18 hole layout as such or, preferably, with'a newly constituted 24 hole'layout or course especially adapted for this game.<br/>      In the game of the present invention, rather than using the existing golf greens which are too rough to putt on during the winter a plurality of ring screens are disposed about the golf cou~se ln suitable 1ocations.<br/>          These ring screens consist of upright screens of any suitable size, such as 5 feet'high by 7 feet wide, mounted on a suitable standard which is optionally, but preferably, firmly anchored in the ground. The upright' screen is provided with a ring or hole to permit passage of the ball.<br/>A suitable receptacle to receive the ball is affixed to the screen behind the ring or hole.  The hole in the screen and the ball used in-the game may be of any suitable size.<br/>In a preferred embodiment of the game, the ball is about one and one half times the size (diameter) of a conventional golf ball and the ring or hole is about one foot in diameter.<br/>       The bat employed in the new game replaces the entire _5_ ! <br/> <br/> conventional set of 13 golf' clubs.  The bat is provided with a suitable handle or grip and shaft similar to that of a tennis racket or cricket bat.  The shaft of the bat differs from those of a tennis racket or crieket bat, however, in that it not as rigid, thus providing a flexing, whippy actiPn.  As in conventional golf clubs, the degree of stiffness or whippiness of the shaft of the bat will vary with the strength and skill of the player.  Just as in golf women and children will choose very whippy shafts, average male players will choose regular shafts, and very strong players will use relatively stiff or extra s`tiff shafts.  The striking head of the bat is also el'ongated and may approximate the length of the grip and shaft together, but is~about three times as wide,' more or less.<br/>     The head may ~take any sultable shape but it desirabIy~has à throat portion of gradually~increasing width ~rom the shaft to the full width'of the striking surface of the head.<br/>         The striking surface may be flat,~but it is preferably slightly round~ed laterally of the head so that the head has;a geperally elliptical lat'eral cross section.  The two strlking surfaces of the' head are optionally but preferably provided ~ith groaves such as thbse on the face of a conventional golf club.  In the bats of the present in-vention3 however, the grooves run laterally of the striking surface on one side of the bat and longitudinally on the other side.  These grooves serve the same ~purpose as those on~a golf club i.e. to grlp the ball on contact and impart spin or "English" to the ball.  The lateral grooves are employed in overhand or underhand strokes and the longitudinal ~6-                    ' ,~<br/> <br/>l l                                     1 !l f grooves in side arm or generally horizontal strokes. The bats are pre~erabIy perf'orated to reduce air resistance when swung.<br/>      The ball is composed on any suitable material and may   f be made in either the wound or solid constructions of con- ~<br/>ventional golf balls. In general, however, the balls used in  3 this game are somewhat softer than ordinary golf balls and are, therefore, suitabIy composed of solid rubber. The hardness of the balls is dictated by the level of play of` the player ~ust as in the game of golf. In other words, women, children and older or weaker players will use a relatively soft ball. Average male players will use a ball'of regular compression or hardness, and very strong players will use a very hard or high compression ball.<br/>      In its most highIy developed' mode, the game is played ' in very much'the same way as golf, not only regarding the actual play of the game but in the rules and etiquette as well. Inasmuch as the maximum average distance a good player will be able to drlve a ball in the present game is about 150 yards, it' is desirable to layout about 24 holes or rings to utilize an entlre 18 hole golf course. In this    ¦' way a course might consist of four par three hbles up to f about 150 yards in length, 16 par four holes of up to about 300 yards in length and four par five holes of up to about 450 yards in length~ for a total par of 96. Of course    3 more par three and par five holes could be employed in place  ff f some of the par fours if desired and there is no reason     a why any particular number of holes must be laid out.<br/> Il                                 f I <br/> <br/> As in golf a teeing ground is designated for each hole by means of a suitable marker or markers   Unlike golf, however, there is no need to build and maintain an expensive grass tee.  A player toes the tee marker, or if he desires, stands anywhere behind the permissible tee line.<br/>         He then tosses the ball into the air with one hand and strikes the ball in the air with the bat in any attempt to dlrve the ball toward the hole or ring screen ~or that hole.  As in golf each strbke is counted.  If the player does not like his toss he may catch the ball and toss it again without penalty.  However, if the player ~ails to hit the ball or to catch it befiore it hits the ground, he is charged a penalty of one stroke.  Failure to hit the ball on the second toss also incurs a one stroke penalty.<br/>     A player has two attempts to heat each shot, incurring a penalty only if he misses the second attempt or if he tries to catch his toss without swinging and fails.<br/>    As in golf, each player of a foursomeg perhaps, plays in turn.  The players then walk to their respective balls and prepare to hit the next shot.  The player furthest from the hole plays first by placing his forward ~oct, the left foot for a right-handed player, behind his ball.  He then picks up the ball and attempts to hit it again counting strokes and penalties for misses as before. Play proceeds   1, in this manner as in gol~ until the ring net for that hole is reachable on the next stroke.  Which ever player is squarely facing the ring net then plays first.  If two or more players squareIy face the net, the player furthest away plays first.  Play proceeds as in golf until all i ` <br/> <br/> ~I  players have holed out i.e. played their ball into the ¦I  hole or ring in the net.  The ring net is rotatable about ~¦  the vertical axis so as to permit it to be positioned to squarely face each player before his shbt. The rule that the player or players who face the net squarely play first is,~ of course, intended~to speed play by minimiæing the time used in rotating the ring net. Therefore, it is desirable ;     for any player squarely fa¢ing the net to continue playing until he holes out or picks up his ball. As in golf there are penalties for hitting a ball out of bounds, a lost ball, ' ¦  unplayable lies and the like, as w111 be explained below.<br/>The usual rules' require that the bat be held in only one hand and that the player's forward or marker foot not leave the ground when hitting the ball. The ball is always hit in the alr and never on the ground or other support.<br/>i             From the foregoing it will be' see~n that since the ball is never playèd from the ground and is not putted on the ground, the game may be played even on ~ thoroughIy frozen golf 3 course, the only limitation being that therè be too little loose snow to make it impossible to find the ball for the I      next stroke.<br/> <br/>                            E ~EF DESCRIPTION OF THE ~RAWINGS<br/> <br/>          I        Figure 1 is a front elevational view of a ring net I of the invention;<br/>        Figure 2 is a side elevational view of the ring net I  ~ of Figure 1 showing the ball-receiving receptacle behind ~ the ring or hole, !~<br/>~                                -       J<br/>1~                          :                         }<br/>~           i Figure 3 is a top plan view o~ a bat of the invention;<br/>     Figure 4 iS a bottom plan view of the bat of ~igure 3;<br/>     Figure 5 is a lateral cross sectional view of the bat ~¦  of Figure 3 taken on the line 5-5; and Figure 6 is a view of a ball of the invention. <br/> <br/> D~TAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENT-ION<br/>~                                       ,~<br/>       In a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in the accompanying drawings, a ring net 10 (Figure 1) has a frame 12 which may consist of upper and lower members as shown or may include side members as well, or any other suitable frame to hold the net 14.  The net 14 is composed of any suitable material such as wire, or nylon or polyester cord, or the like and has a mesh smaller than the diameter of the ball so that a ball can not be driven through the mesh of the net even when struck with great force.  The net 14 is supported on a standard made up of a base member 16 and an upright 18 which is in two parts, upper and lower.<br/>  The upper portion of the upright 18 is hollow so as to receive internally an extension of the lower part of the upright so as to be axially rotatable thereon.  The upper and lower portions of the upright 18 are each provided with meshing toothed members 20.  When it is desired to rotate the screen to face a player squarely at right angles to his line of play, another player grasps the ring net or upper portion of the mounting upright 18 and lifts it to dîsengage the two toothed members 20.  After rotating the net~ and upper portion of the upright 18 to the desired degree:, the net and upper part of the upright are lowered again over the i~         ~<br/>-lQ-                                                  I <br/> <br/> ~7 ~ inner portion of the lower part of the upright until the 7~ two members 20 are again engaged to lock the net in the 71 desired position against rotation during the play of the 7 I¦ shot. The base 16 is preferably provided with spikes 22 ¦ to anchor the ring net in the ground.<br/>7 The ring net is provided with a centrally located ring 24 surrounding a hole in the net :~or passage of the ¦ ball. A pocket 26 or ball-receiving receptacle is affixed ¦ to the ring net behind the ring as shown in Figure 2.<br/>This pocket is preferably.reversible so as to be disposed ¦ on either side of the net. While the ring net may be of ¦ any suitable size or proportions, it has been found that excellent performance is provlded by a net about five feet high by about seven, feet long suspended with the lower edge of th,e net about 1 to 3:,feet :above th.e ground, thus locating ,            the center o~: the ring about, 3.5 to 5.5 feet above the .,,          ~round. The height of the ring maD be varied from hole to ;l           h.ole on the course or day to day between a low of about 2..5 feet to a high of about 6 feet or more to vary the game as in placement of the cup in conventional golf. In general, however, the lower edge of the net is spaced about one fo'ot above .the ground to place the lower edge of the ring 3 feet above the ground.<br/>      The bat, as shown in Figures, 3, 4 and 5 has a con-~          ¦¦ ventional grip or handle 28 such as that of a te~mis racket, ¦ suitabIy shaped and dimensioned to rit the hand ~of the user.<br/>7 The extension of the' handle 28 is a reIatively whippy shaft ¦ 3Q~ This shaft 30 may be of rough1.y the same thi'ckness and cross section s the relatively stlff handle 28 but in order to provide suitable flexibility is usually stepped down to a smaller cross section or composed of a more flexible material.  The purpose of providing a flexible shaft 30 is the same as that in golf, i.e. to impart greater power to the shot ~ith a given swing, thus helping to compensate ror the lack of strength of weaker players.  Therefore, the shaft may be made relatively whippy ~or players with smaller and weaker physi~ues such as children, women and small or elderly men.  A less wh1ppy or regular shaft would be used by the average male player, while a relatively less whippy or fairly stiff shaft would be used by very strong pIayers.<br/>    The head of the bat 32 is roughly the same length as the grip or handle and shaft taken together, but is about three or four times as wide, more or less.  While the striking surfaces of the head of the bat may be perfectly flat~ it is preferred that they have a slight lateral curvature or rad1us to provlde a generally elliptical lateral cross section as best seen in Fig~r~_5.  This provides~ for narrower contact with the ball and improves the control of the shot.  The striking surfaces of the bat are provided with longitudinal grooves 34 on one side and lateral grooves 36 on the other slde.  Th~e spacing an-d number of the grooves is not critical but should be such as to provide ~good contact with the ball to impart spln or "English" the~eto as desired for control of the~flight of the ball.  While the bat may have any suitable size and proportlons it has been found that sport level bats are suitably about two feet long, the shaft and handle together being about one foot long and the head about bne foot long.<br/>         In such a bat the grip will be about l.5 inches ln diameter and the head of the bat will be about 4.5 inches wide.  The diameter of the shaft will vary with the stiffness desired.<br/>         While the striking surface is norma1ly convex on both sides ¦<br/>as described above and as shown in F'igure 5, some players may prefer that at least one si:de of the bat be~slightly concave.  This might be ~desirable for the side having lateral grooves ~hich would normalIy be used for shorter shots such as approach sh:ots: and holing out in the ring net.<br/>    The ball, as shown in ~igure 5, is spherical but is preferably dimpled like a conventional golf ball in order to make it fly through the'air more truly.  As is well known, a conventional golf ball is about 1 5/8, (,about li2 mm) in diameter in the United States; the British golf ball.being ab~out 1/64 smaller. Wh.ile .such balls may be used in the present game it is preferred to use'a ball about 1.5 times as la'rge.<br/>         Therefore, th.e balls may have a diameter in the~ range from about 1.5 to-abo:ut 3 inches (about 39 mm to about 78 mm) but are preferabIy about 2.7jl6 inches (62 mmj in diameter.  The balls may be constructed in the. various ways conventional golf balls are made, i.e. liquid core, rubber wound with a balata cover; solid molded; or solid molded with a balata or other c.over.  Such balls are, how.ever, too hard for use by most players, parti.oularly in the~ casual game ~or child's past:ime levels of play, and, ther:efore, such players will prefer a solid rubber ball of suitable hardness i.e. medium hardness ~or the casual game and soft for children's play.  I<br/>    As noted above the foregoing apparatus is intended to be used to play a game substantially the same as, conventional ~ i     1 golf except that the ball is played by tossing it in the air with one hand and striking it with the bat held in the i other hand. The only o-ther ~ajor difference is that the   3 ball is holed out in the pocket of the ring net by hitting j it through'the air rather than rolling it across a con-    j ¦ ventional putting green. In general, the bat is swung in a long overhead arc similar to a tennis service skroke in order to make a long shot comparable to the drive off a tee on a par four par f`ive or long par three hole. Long shots f'rom    f the fairway or rough, comparable to fairway wood or long ~;     iron golf shots are also made~with an overhead swing of the bat. As shorter shots, comparable to the middle irons ln golf are made, the arc of the swing of the bat may be shbrtened by the use of a flatter, less upright swing, thus reducing the distance the ball travels. Still shorter shots ~¦ comparable to the short irons of golf are made swinging the bat in a still shorter arc at the horizontal leveI or below.<br/>` Hitting the ball from below the horizontal elevates the arc of flight thus further shortening the distance of travel as in the use of the pitching or sand wedges in ~olf. The ball is holed out in the ring net by the use of an underhanded or i~ side arm, generally horizontal, stroke, if desired.<br/>l ~he grooves on the bat and the angle of the swing are 3 utilized to make all of the required shots in this game com-parable to those in golf, including the intentional slice or ¦ fade3 draw or hook, high, low, pitch, clip3 or punch shots and so on. The'grooves also impart spin or English as in tennis to put ~ack spin on the ball for a quick stop, overspin   3.<br/>to cause the ball to'run, or right or left spin to cause the }<br/>3                     -lLI-     ' `l                ~ <br/> <br/> ~' I ball to curve in the desired direction. Each shot in the i~ new game requires the proper stance, grip~ swing, timlng concentration and f'ollow-through of a comparable golf' shot.<br/>I¦ The hszards of golf' are also employed and come into play in I   ~ much the same way e.g. uphill and downhill shcts, sidehill shbts, bunkersg water hazards, trees, man made obstructions ¦ and the elements of wind, rain and snow.<br/>         The game may be played in an unlimited variety of' 3 locations, not only on existing golf' courses, but on courses especially bullt and designed f'or the new flip golf game. `<br/>~;'    Casual play may also be enjoyed on beaches, in parks, fields, back yards, paved play grounds or any other location having suf'ficient room and where at least one ring net may be set up. Thè game may be played as a serious sport by players of all ages and skills and may be handicapped in just the same   i~<br/>¦ way as golf' in order to permit competition between players of varying skill.<br/>      As noted previously, the game and apparatus are adapted ..     ~                 ,   ..<br/>to lend themselves to thr`ee separate levels of play. The     $<br/>game as a serious sport has been described above. The game ~may also be played as a simple ~game rather than as a serious sport and less expensive and sophisticated apparatus of the same type may be provided for such casual or smaller scale play. If desired the size of the ring nets may be diminished for such play. Still further, the game may be played as a~<br/>child's pastime, using toy implements. For example, the 3~ ring net may be reduced to about 2 x 3 feet with an 8" hole and the balls and bats as well as the ring nets may be made ,~ of lighter weight and less expensive materials. The ring '~ -15-~1 ! <br/> <br/> f~ net may simply be set into a welghted metal stand or be 13 stuck into soft ground or sand and be ready for immediate f3 play. For children's play the bat is suitably of smaller           3 ¦I dimensions and lighter weight, e.g. 18" overall with a 9"<br/>   head and ~ 'f shaft and grip and the shaft is of the very whippy type. Such a whippy shaft will enab]e a well           f coordinated child to hit a ball nearly as far as an adult f' using a s~iffer shaft. As noted previously the ball is ! pre~erably much softer and lighter for child's play and f the ring net is suitably only about 2' x 3' with an 8" ring.<br/>         From the ~oregoing it will be seen that a new garne has been provided lncorporating some o~ the features of tennis, badminton, baseball, basketball and cricket, but      3 l which is primarily a golf game and this has wide appeal but         lf f an especial appeal to the avid golfer. The new game has the         3 I advantage over golf that no expensive putting greens, grass         f f~ tees or carefully maintained fairways are required. The new 1~ game also has the advankage that it employs only one re-       3 ¦~ latively inexpensive club rather than a full set of 13 golf        3 ¦'~ clubs, and a bag which require a caddy or golf cart to transport. The new game has all of the advantages of golf 3 when played as a serious sport, however, since it is equally 3 ¦¦ difficult to master and remains a challenge to play well no j3f matter how proficient a player ~ecomes. The ef~uipE~nt is f~ relatively simple, although the clubs will be made in a wide ~3 range of weights and whippiness of shaft to accommodate the   f 331 tastes and physical attributes o~ the players ranging from   3 ,¦ strong athletic men to women and children. Different head     f 31 weights in men's clubs are easily provided by interchangeable 3 i~                                 ) weights so that on].y one basic club need be manufactured.<br/>          There~ore, it should be apparent that the game apparatus de~cribed above achieves all of the objects of the present fl invention and provides a substitute for gol~ which can be I¦ played during the winter to a~ford th~e same recreation and l~f exercise. <br/> <br/> ~:                ; <br/> <br/> l3       -17    f </div>
