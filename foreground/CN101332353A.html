<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0008">Summary of the invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0009" num="0009">Set out thus, the objective of the invention is, improve the table tennis bat of described type like this, think that realization carries out personalized coupling to the sportsman.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0010" num="0010">According to the present invention, described purpose is by being provided for that in handle the device of table tennis bat centre-of gravity shift is realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0011" num="0011">Therefore, the sportsman can regulate the position of centre of gravity of racket once according to its wish, perhaps according to the training program of determining or according to carrying out the change of racket position of centre of gravity for the needed match mode of determining of adversary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0012" num="0012">The described device that is used to make the position of centre of gravity skew can comprise can handle vertically on the weight of location differently, for this reason can handle vertically on can arrange a plurality of grooves, can preferable shape is sealed described weight be enclosed in the described groove (formschl ü ssig).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0013" num="0013">A kind of particularly advantageous form of implementation imagination, handle has the recess of extension in the vertical, and a sliding part can wherein be formed with the groove that is used to hold weight in sliding part from the described recess of distolateral insertion of handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0014" num="0014">Described groove is can be towards a side open fully or towards opposite side part ground opening, thus weight can pack into and abut on the described opposite side from a described side, but can described weight be released again by the opening on the described opposite side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0015" num="0015">Advantageously be furnished with end cap on sliding part outer distolateral, the exterior configuration of this end cap can be designed to corresponding with the distolateral exterior configuration of handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0016" num="0016">Imagination advantageously, end cap is supported swingably, thereby can make end caps in arrive together the handle effect, with respect to the state of the distolateral deflection of racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0017" num="0017">Preferably, end cap is injection molded by plastic monoblock ground, and has the kayser annex of the band joint-cutting in the distolateral recess that can snap in the sliding part matrix, has realized axial restraint on the one hand thus, has guaranteed the swing property of wishing on the other hand.</div>

<mode-for-invention>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0023" num="0023">The specific embodiment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0024" num="0024">Table tennis bat 1 shown in the figure comprise clappers 2 and thereon side be provided with the handle 3 of window 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0025" num="0025">Handle 3 has vertical recess 5, and sliding part 6 can move in described vertical recess 5.Sliding part 6 shape by this way is sealed or rub and be positioned in the handle 3 sealedly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0026" num="0026">Sliding part 6 comprises the matrix 7 of microscler cuboid, and this matrix 7 has the groove 8 of three cuboid structures in this embodiment, and described groove 8 is open fully up, and has oval-shaped opening 9 at downside.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0027" num="0027">The weight 10 that the size of outside dimension and groove 8 is complementary is can shape sealed or rub and pack in the groove 8 sealedly.Be loaded in the dead slot 8 at front portion, centre or rear portion the further skew forward or backward more or less of the center of gravity of racket 1 according to weight 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0028" num="0028">Elliptical openings 9 on sliding part 6 downsides makes and such as shown in fig. 1 the making progress of weight 10 can be extruded, thereby makes the position that can change weight 10 simply.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0029" num="0029">In sliding part 6 is being packed state on outer distolateral 11, be fixed with the end cap 12 that the working of plastics by integral molded plastic constitutes.Be provided with the kayser annex 13 that has joint-cutting 14 in the centre of end cap 12 inboards, this kayser annex 13 can snap in sliding part 6 distolateral 11 on recess 15 in.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0030" num="0030">Because this design, end cap 12 can be swung in the kayser state.In user mode, end cap 12 form fit ground covers freely outer distolateral 16 of handle 3.If desired sliding part 6 is taken out, so that the displacement of weight 10 can for example be swung 90 ° with end cap 12, thereby it can be with acting on the handle of pulling out.</div>
