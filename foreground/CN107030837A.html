<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003" num="0003">Background technology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0004">Table tennis bat is made up of bottom plate, rubber and the part of sponge three.The reasonably combined matter for determining one piece of racket of three
Amount.We frequently refer to table tennis bat and the term of sponge, such as：" speed ", " control " and " elasticity " " bottom plate is soft or hard " etc..In fact
These indexs but all without the unified numerical value of industry, simply all big enterprises in order to can be had certain experience to draw on when consumer buys and from
What oneself divided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">The performance indications of bottom plate, so-called " speed ", refer to batting firmly acts on ball through racket, is allowed to be converted into ball
The efficiency for flying into speed；So-called " rotation " refers to that the racket that firmly passes through of batting acts on ball, is allowed to be converted into revolutions speed
The efficiency of degree；So-called " control " refers to time length (this and the bottom needed with identical strength and method square stance, ball disengaging racket
" soft, the hard sphere sense " of plate is relevant)；So-called " effective hitting scope " or referred to as " batting dessert " refers to that striking force can be concentrated
The position being delivered on bottom plate and scope (this is relevant with the shape, structure, material of bottom plate).Performance in terms of aforementioned four is existing
Each different the characteristics of, connect each other, influence each other again.Therefore when choosing bottom plate, outward appearance is not only seen, the number of plies is counted, and
Also to see wood grain arrangement architecture；Listening is not only wanted, and its soft, hardness is also felt with finger when tapping；Not only
The index of correlation indicated on bottom plate is read, but also ball is weighed in the hand with different strength, to feel its use force efficiency and comprehensive
Close performance.Generally speaking, bottom plate, which have passed through one section the good and bad jumbled together, respectively strives after the epoch of length, is also got over regard to the mark of each index now
Come more close.In general each bottom plate manufacturer can all indicate " speed " and " control " the two indexs, index from 1-10 (or
1-12) grade is divided, and for person's bat experience, general indicator registration is slightly worse when being 6, be when 7 it is general, 8 be it is good,
8.5 preferably, and more than 8.5 be exactly good.But this is also only limited to butterfly (Butterfly), Si Dika (STIGA), TIBHAR,
Etc. foreign brand name, the country is divided or some are chaotic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0006">The performance indications of rubber, positive photoresist is also short particle rubber, and feature is that elasticity is good, speed is fast, batting is steady, does not eat and turns,
It is adapted to close-to-table fast attack, especially backhand block with forehand type play, is one of the most frequently used rubber type of straight panel quick attack type player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0007">Gram ball (Pickleball) is a kind of motion batted with racket, is that Ritchie island is not emerging from the sheet of seattle, U.S.A
Rise.It is the hybrid motion of tennis, shuttlecock and table tennis to say it, that be most it is appropriate only.It is invented by two people.
A dog of the title from one of inventor of " gram " ball；Start invention examination beat when, that entitled gram dog is normal
Often hold ball race in the month.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0008">At present, the plank core preparation technology of the racket of table tennis or a gram ball generally uses paper wasp in racket intermediate course
The materials such as nest plate, plastic cement, expanded material, are made up, final finished difference of hardness, anti-strike ability is poor, leads to not fit of bonding
Frequently swung the bat in the match for answering high intensity shots.</div>

Fresh, also there is introducing and planting in Europe and North America.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0044" num="0044">Paulownia wood is drawer and the topmost use material of bed board at home, and paulownia wood is with its excellent characteristic by such as Dalian Hua Fengjia
The prominent domestic men of Furniture Factory such as tool, the magnificent day furniture in Langfang, Dalian Bright Furniture Stocks Trading Co., the magnificent crane household in Heilungkiang, feudal dynasty furniture are used as taking out
The production of drawer and bed board, paulownia wood with resistance to rotten acid and alkali-resistance it is peculiar the characteristics of, so people custom use paulownia carpentery workshop coffin.It is wear-resisting
Damage：Though paulownia material is light, not easy to wear, all made in the bellows cooked in the past of paulownia wood, pull bar is ground examine back and forth, and boxboard is but difficult
Abrasion.Beautiful texture is bright in colour：Paulownia material has a kind of with spun silk light, graceful, fine and smooth texture, and natural pattern spy is good.Leading note
Property is strong：Paulownia wood is to be the indispensable person of musical instrument, no matter Changes in weather, can stablize tone color, therefore have the title of " qin paulownia ".Such as dulcimer, plucked string instrument with a fretted fingerboard
Pa, liuqin or even Qin's Hu etc., all using paulownia as plate face.Easily engraving dyeing：Paulownia wood is difficult splitting but wooden soft, easy processing, easily engraving,
Easy dyeing.It makees beam, purlin, door and window, ceiling, shoe plate and room partition plate etc. architectural.Due to it also have smoke impermeable,
Damp proof insulation, it is the ideal material for manufacturing top-grade furniture and musical instrument in terms of daily living article the advantages of be difficult to damage by worms.Paulownia man
Tool is high-grade goods salable in Japan, and paulownia wood coffin is the prime quality of funeral ceremony in South Korea.In military and industrial aspect, by
It is lighter than general timber in paulownia wood, therefore have for doing the liner plate in model airplane, precision instrument shell, passenger steamer and car, navigate
The empty and specific use such as water transportation packing case and fine paper and handicraft.People again match into paulownia and aluminium alloy
It is double, with aircraft and submarine.</div>
