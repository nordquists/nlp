<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">The content of the invention
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0006">For overcome the deficiencies in the prior art, one dual-purpose table tennis bat can be clapped it is an object of the invention to provide a kind of.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is achieved by the following technical solution：It includes racket and removable short handle, long handle, is designed with countersunk head screwed hole and regular screw threads hole on the handle of short handle, long handle and racket, by the effect of being connected of screw, can realize the connection and fixation of short handle or long handle and racket.Therefore, the present invention can fix the two kinds of play that can be achieved with a kind of racket by simply and easily screw, greatly save the cost of table tennis fan, while also save resource.We are filled up the pit that counter sink and screwed hole leave with sealing ring, that is, the demand for meeting feel has also reached effect attractive in appearance.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0008">Technical scheme described above can further be improved by following measure：
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0009" num="0009">The screw of the effect that is connected selects lightweight material, here, we select be wooden materials.Because the screw thread of racket is wooden, wooden screw can mitigate the pressure to racket screwed hole, increase the service life.Also, wooden material is little to the original weight of racket, original feel is influenceed smaller.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0010" num="0010">Counter sink is set on the short handle and long handle, is threaded hole in racket handle, the position of design play connection function while, also play positioning action.And the design of counter sink can sink to screw inside handle, space is left to modification feel and aesthetic appeal.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0011" num="0011">Handle sets bar-shaped trough on the long handle end, and lower handle sets bar shaped boss, is connected for long handle with racket and plays positioning and fixation.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0012" num="0012">The sealing ring is quality of rubber materials, because rubber is less expensive and light, too much influence will not be produced to the quality of racket, also one big advantage is that rubber is flexible, tight fit larger frictional force can be produced between hole, so as to eliminate outer adding additives, the trouble that sealing ring difficulty is removed when changing handle is also reduced.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0013" num="0013">Effect collects
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0014" num="0014">Provided by the invention one claps dual-purpose table tennis bat.It realizes the connection of short handle or long handle and racket by screw and screwed hole, causes a bat to possess two kinds of functions of pen-hold grip and shake-hands grip with simply and easily mode.Greatly reduce and like two kinds of pen-hold grip, shake-hands grip play and also in the economic pressures for the table tennis fan for groping the play stage, while also reached the purpose to economize on resources.
