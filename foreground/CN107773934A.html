<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">The existing table tennis bat with device for scoring is typically used and is electronically entered, and electronical display or sound report form,
For its electronic installation typically at racket handle, production and processing is relatively difficult, also influences to clap the intensity of handle, in shake of frequently swinging the bat
Under the invasion and attack of dynamic and sweat, it is difficult to ensure its reliability, while manufacturing cost is higher.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0006">The content of the invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0007">It is an object of the invention to overcome weak point of the prior art, there is provided a kind of easy to use, low band of cost
The table tennis bat of score disk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0008">The purpose of the present invention is achieved through the following technical solutions：</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0009" num="0009">A kind of table tennis bat of band score disk, including face and bat handle, respectively set the both sides of junction in the face and bat
There is a rotating disk, being marked on the periphery of each rotating disk or rotating disk has score value；</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0010" num="0010">Further, on described two rotating disks or disk peripheral totally 11 score values of mark 0 to 10 respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0011" num="0011">Beneficial effects of the present invention：As a result of above technical scheme, when match starts, two rotating disks are all placed in score value
" 0 ", increase then as both sides' score and stir two rotating disks respectively, when score occurs 11 to 10,11 are represented with score value " 0 "
Point, if both sides' score be changed into 11 it is flat when, now both sides all with score value " 0 " represent, stir rotating disk again afterwards and record leading fraction,
Until the leading 2 points of end of a side.The racket of the present invention allows user easily to record score, that is, is adapted to player to use
It also is adapted for seeing ball person use, eliminates the trouble of brain score, be particularly suitable for using in amateurish playday.</div>
