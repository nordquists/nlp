Backhand is weakness because backhand can not attack mainly with defence based on.The technology of straight panel by-blow had been invented in China again in recent years, just
It is the backward shot with straight panel, often surprises, and loop drive can be pulled out.Straight panel is for our amateurish competitors
It is easy to hand, but beats straight panel and requires paces flexible.Traditional racket it is either round and rectangular be all that left and right is " right
Claim, be balanced " shape, however pursue abnormal-shape bat batting feature both at home and abroad there are plenty of such people, some people change conventional racquets
Plate face or plate handle such as change " violin " of face shape, and also someone, which always is, is studying " asymmetric " shape racket,
Foreign countries have " water-drop-shaped " that changes face and handle angle and " Y-7 type " " 96 formula " of the country to be commonly called as askew handle racket;There are also will
" along drot gfasplng " etc. that bat angle and handle shape all thoroughly change.If change racket shape without change " method of holding bat ",
It changes " center ball strike " for mainly changing racket;Certainly change handle shape and change simultaneously " method of holding bat ", then bat
Will generate apparent variation with mode, the racket for being known as " attacking on four sides " a kind of in recent years is exactly the shape for revolutionizing handle
