<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a table tennis racket, in particular to a handle of the table tennis racket.</div>

<background-art>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003">Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0002">At present, table tennis rackets are roughly classified into three types, one is a straight-grip type table tennis racket (hereinafter referred to as "straight racket"), one is a cross-grip type table tennis racket (hereinafter referred to as "cross racket"), and the other is a gun type table tennis racket (hereinafter referred to as "gun racket") which has appeared in recent years. The straight bat and the transverse bat handles are vertical to the longitudinal axis of the ball board; the rifle bat, because it is not stereotyped yet, the handle has and is the slope with the ball board, has and is 90 degrees dog-ear horizontal extensions with the ball board, has to set up a vertically bat handle on the handle, sets up a horizontal bat handle that is 90 degrees dog-ear horizontal extensions with the ball board again.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0003">The user holds the racket handle by the thumb and the forefinger, and the middle finger, the ring finger and the little finger are propped against the back surface of the ball board. The holding posture has lower hand position, the holding and beating fulcrum is closer to the center of the ball board, so the resultant force of the body, the arms and the wrist can be conducted to the ball board to the maximum extent, the hitting force is large, and the racket is suitable for fast attack on a nearby table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0004">However, the structure of the hand is that the thumb faces one direction, the other fingers face the opposite direction of the thumb, when the racket is held by a straight bat, the index finger goes upwards from the natural downward position and winds from the back to the front of the racket to be buckled with the thumb together to the handle, the holding posture violates the natural body structure of the player, and the wrist and the fingers of the player are limited to be fully exerted in playing the ball. Particularly, when the straight racket is used, the index finger is locked with the wrist joint after winding to the front of the racket, namely the so-called reverse joint relation, so that the function of the wrist is limited, and the ball hitting by turning the wrist is basically impossible; but also limits the function of the index finger, and the index finger has no other positive effects except the holding and beating effect. When the player is used for shooting a ball by a straight-bat and backheating, such as backswing and pushing a gear, the index finger becomes an obstacle. Therefore, when the penhold is used, the player needs to be broken with great force to turn the wrist of the player to the maximum. This is very unscientific, unreasonable and not yet a goal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0005">In the table tennis sports history of our country, there is a player who calls Zhang forest, in order to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantage of penhold, put the forefinger on the back of the bat, pinch the bat with thumb and forefinger, play the ball. Such a holding posture is known as a knife. Although the problem of back locking wrist joint when the forefinger goes around the front is solved, the racket is not held tightly by the holding posture, and the racket is easy to fall off when killing the ball with great force. So the shooting mode of a regulation is mainly for cutting the ball. The holding posture of the knife sacrifices the vigorous killing of the penhold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0006">Because the straight bat can only use one side of the bat to hit the ball, when the bat is hit by the backhand, the wrist is turned over, and the bat is used to hit the ball by the same side of the bat. As the axial rotating amplitude of the wrist of the human body is limited, the ball beyond the axial rotating amplitude of the wrist can not be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0009" num="0007">In addition, although the direct racket is suitable for the close-table fast attack, when a ball is shot, the user needs to swing the arms greatly regardless of the forehand or backhand, and the ball which cannot be hit, close-table ball or chased ball without enough arm swing space is difficult to be killed, and only can be rubbed or pushed, and the ball return strength is weak.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0010" num="0008">Furthermore, the flexibility of the wrist of the racket is affected, and when the racket is used for shooting a ball, the wrist cannot move around, the racket keeps stiff and straight, and the racket keeps a specific angle and is in a hand shape. The direct-beating hand shape does not play the role of the wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0011" num="0009">In addition, the direct-acting type has other disadvantages:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0012" num="0010">theoretically, when the straight racket strikes a ball by a forehand, the racket face can be rotated from the upward direction to the downward direction to the parallel direction with the ground to the maximum, so that the hitting force is maximum, but because the hand shape is fixed at a specific initial angle, at least half of the moving space is sacrificed when the forehand is turned forwards from the initial angle. The maximum turning amplitude of the human hand should be 180 degrees, that is, the palm of the human hand can face upwards and downwards. If the bat surface of the bat can be consistent with the rotation amplitude of the wrist, the hitting amplitude can be greatly improved. When the table tennis is pulled and the arc is rotated and the table tennis is killed in the table tennis sport, the larger the rotation amplitude of the table tennis is, the higher the hitting force is, and the stronger the control on the table tennis is. The hand-shaped direct-shooting type has limited overturning amplitude, especially for the contrary hand, so that the ideal strength of the ball attacking and killing can not be achieved; and the arc rotary ball drawn by the direct racket is not as rotating as that drawn by the transverse racket due to the limitation of the turning range of the hand shape of the direct racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0013" num="0011">The direct-clapping backhand is the weak point of the direct-clapping player. The direct-beating and reverse-beating method is a beating method which has to be adopted because of the inexperience. When in use, the swatter surface can only be turned forwards to be vertical to the ground or to pass a little, even the body is bent forwards in a matching way, and the body is upright and is difficult to be killed by hands. The wrist cannot be turned forward any more due to the reverse joint. If the bat surface is parallel to the axis of the wrist, the bat can be turned backwards by 90 degrees or forwards by 90 degrees easily, so that 180 degrees of space is enough to deal with the problem of backhand. Scientific and unscientific, and reasonable and unreasonable, are worse by 90 degrees. The problem is caused by the holding posture of the penhold, and the problem cannot be solved without changing the holding posture of the penhold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0014" num="0012">When a player holds the racket by hand, the forefinger and the thumb enter the rubber part of the front side of the racket, and other fingers enter the rubber part of the racket from the back side of the racket. When playing the table tennis, the table tennis is often played on the index finger. This problem exists from the first day of the birth of the penhold, but has not been solved to date.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0015" num="0013">When the player directly shoots the ball by the forehand and the backhand, the forefinger and the thumb do not exert force; when the user takes a direct beat and makes a reverse beat, the middle finger, the ring finger and the small finger do not exert force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0016" num="0014">The penhold is finally sent to a historical museum, which is the rise of the arc spinning ball era of table tennis. The rotary arc rotary ball can not be pressed by the reverse hand of the direct-beating machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0017" num="0015">Because of the disadvantages of the straight bat, the number of people using the straight bat is less and less, and the transverse bat, also called as big knife bat, becomes the mainstream of the table tennis bat at present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0018" num="0016">The user can hold the racket handle by the whole palm and five fingers of the user to conveniently use the front and back surfaces of the racket. The middle and far platforms of the transverse bat have sufficient force, wide ball catching surface and strong attack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0019" num="0017">However, when the horizontal bat is naturally held, the bat end is raised by about 45 degrees, so the bat needs to be hung by a wrist to hit the ball. The means that the axis of the horizontal bat forms an included angle of about 45 degrees with the arm holding the bat. Therefore, the horizontal racket has to hang the wrist when hitting the ball, and the serious consequence of hitting the ball by hanging the wrist is to sacrifice half of the activity space of the wrist. In this case, the horizontal bat must forcibly and constantly perform complicated wrist correction every time a ball is hit. In the special, ever-changing and extremely high-speed sport of table tennis, it is extremely difficult to accurately correct the best position of the wrist in an extremely short time. This disadvantage of the bat forces the player to move back to the middle or far table and hit the ball at the table tennis drop point, giving the player sufficient time to adjust the position of the wrist. However, the ball making device of the table tennis is fast attack, and the best position of the fast attack is to hit the ball at the rebound rising point of the table tennis. When the table tennis is hit at a descending point, only the fast attack can be sacrificed, and then the fast attack is retreated and solved, and the table tennis is processed by adopting a ball pulling or cutting mode. The force of returning the ball is weak when the ball is pulled or cut. This disadvantage of the horizontal slap makes it inconvenient to attack quickly. The disadvantage is that the holding posture is not ergonomic and is inherent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0020" num="0018">When the table tennis bat is held, the direction of the palm of the hand is generally referred to as the front of the hand, and the direction of the back of the hand is generally referred to as the back of the hand. When the user transversely beats the right hand, the user takes the right hand forward and takes the back hand backward; when the user takes a transverse pat and turns his hand, the user takes a transverse pat before and after the hand. The table tennis field knows that the hand with the bat in front of the hand has good playing stability, and the hand with the bat behind the hand has poor playing stability. The stability of the cross-bat forward pull ball is much higher than that of the reverse pull ball. The transverse beating and the reverse hand pulling of the ball are nearly in pushing and blocking, and the error rate is far higher than that of the forehand. Therefore, the transverse beating backhand mostly mainly cuts the ball and returns the slower ball to ensure that the ball does not go out of bounds. For table tennis, this stability-based sport, pushing and pulling with a backhand is disadvantageous. This is a natural defect of horizontal flapping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0021" num="0019">The big swing arm is needed to be swung by the forehand and the backhand of the transverse bat when the ball is drawn, the larger the arm action is, the higher the rotation degree of the arc rotary ball is, and the larger the drawing and killing force is, so that the transverse bat and the straight bat are not easy to handle for the billiards, the short balls close to the table and the body-chasing balls without too large swing arm space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0022" num="0020">The flexibility of the wrist of the horizontal racket is also influenced, the horizontal racket mainly plays a ball by swinging the arm like a straight racket, and in order to ensure that the racket surface forms a specific angle when contacting with a table tennis ball during ball striking, the racket surface needs to keep a certain initial angle, so that the wrist cannot be relaxed and the wrist needs to keep stiff, which is called as a hand shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0023" num="0021">In addition, horizontal slap has other disadvantages:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0024" num="0022">when the user takes a transverse bat and pulls the loop ball by hand, the swinging amplitude of the arm can be larger, and the larger the swinging amplitude of the arm is, the stronger the return ball can be played or the more rotary arc rotating ball can be pulled out. When the racket is used for reversely pulling the arc-shaped ball, the swinging amplitude of the arm is limited, and the swinging amplitude of the arm is small, so that the force for returning the ball is weak, and the rotating force of the pulled arc-shaped rotating ball is not strong. So the reverse hand pulling arc rotation is more like pushing. Pushing in on either the near station or the intermediate station poses far less threat to the opponent than the killing and pulling of the ball on the right hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0025" num="0023">The transverse bat, whether the right hand or the left hand, has larger swing amplitude, and the swing amplitude is limited because the near table is blocked by the table. The player can not hit the table to quickly attack without swinging arms, and can only be compelled to move back to the middle table or far table to hit balls without any possibility, and the soul of the table tennis is a 'quick' word. The operation is not fast as soon as the platform is returned. This drawback of horizontal slap is also very fatal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0026" num="0024">Ping-pong and tennis are called tennis in English, but table tennis is called table tennis and table tennis is used. The table area is much smaller than the tennis court, is far away from the table, and is difficult to accurately control the falling point of the ball. For the table tennis, the table tennis is driven to move back to the middle table or the far table, is defensive, is not necessary tactics for the table tennis, and is caused by that the table tennis is not favorable for quick attack by a near table in a transverse bat holding posture when the table tennis is moved back to the middle table or the far table. The tennis court is wide, the tennis court is pulled by standing on the bottom line, the length and the width of the court can be fully utilized, and the tennis court is a main battle method for playing tennis by adjusting the opponent. Therefore, the drawing of the middle and far table is not the advantage of table tennis, but the characteristic of tennis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0027" num="0025">The thumb of the transverse racket is not used when the thumb is slightly forceful no matter the transverse racket attacks and kills the arc ring ball by the front hand or pulls the arc ring ball by the reverse hand; when the user is working against the hand, the index finger can not be used. In addition to using the force of swinging arms, the force of fingers is also important in playing table tennis, especially in playing speed and heavy tennis. This drawback of horizontal slap is again very fatal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0028" num="0026">The transverse bat has other defects which are not listed, and the defects are enough to indicate that the transverse bat can not lead the table tennis to continue to advance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0029" num="0027">In order to overcome the disadvantages of the two holding postures, a gun type table tennis racket has appeared in recent years. As shown in figure 1, the Chinese patent No. 92243422 discloses that when trying to obtain the flexible and quick characteristics of direct-holding racket and the strong points of horizontal racket, a straight-holding racket handle (3) perpendicular to the racket board and a horizontal-holding racket handle (4) which forms a 90-degree break angle with the racket board and horizontally extends are provided, a finger hole (7) is dug out from the upward extending part of the racket board outside the joint part of the straight-holding racket handle and the horizontal-holding racket handle, and the forefinger passes through the finger hole and is buckled with the thumb together with the vertical straight-holding racket handle (3). This is essentially the same as a straight-grip racket except that the middle, ring and small fingers are not held against the back of the board, but rather are held across a horizontally extending, horizontally-held handle (4) through another large hole (6) dug in the upward extension of the board. Although the racket with the structure can be used as a straight racket with a positive hand, and used as a transverse racket with a negative hand. However, the advantages of the conventional racket handle cannot be fully realized. For example, when the racket is used for straight racket, because the holding part is higher and is far away from the central position of the racket board, the resultant force of the legs, the waist, the arms and the wrists cannot act on the central position of the racket board close to the batting point through the fingers directly abutting against the back of the racket board, but is firstly transmitted to the vertical racket handle far away from the center of the racket board, then transmitted to the edge of the racket board connected with the vertical racket handle from the vertical racket handle, and further transmitted to the batting point from the edge of the racket board. Certain force is lost in the conduction process; when the racket is used for transverse racket, the thumb and the forefinger which are held on the handle of the straight racket cannot help to adjust the angle of the racket, but rather become an obstacle to the batting strength because the acting force directions of the thumb and the forefinger are inconsistent with those of the middle finger, the ring finger and the little finger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0030" num="0028">In order to exert the power of fast attack of the close stage by direct-handed beating, the athlete should stay on the close stage, and in order to exert the play of the backhand horizontal beating, the athlete should stay on the middle and far stages. When the user needs to take the racket to the right hand, the player needs to take the racket to the near table, and when the user needs to take the racket to the reverse hand, the player needs to move back to the middle table and the far table. In a very short moment, the player can be moved up and down, and no matter whether the player can do the exercise or not, the player can do the exercise, so that the player can be moved up and down repeatedly, the player can also get into passivity and fatigue, and the competition level and tactics of the player cannot be played at all. The racket has what practical advantages to be difficult to say.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0031" num="0029">Although the said gun bat can change the bat in two modes at any time, it is higher than the straight bat hand, the center of gravity is deviated from the center of the bat, and the force of ball-drawing and ball-catching is not as good as that of the current straight bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0032" num="0030">The above-mentioned rifle bat, like the direct bat and the horizontal bat, still fails to solve the problem of catching up a body ball, a short ball in a table and a ball close to the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0033" num="0031">The thumb and the forefinger of the gun bat are held on the handle of the straight bat, and the force is not applied when the user cuts and pulls the ball by the opposite hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0034" num="0032">When the gun racket draws the arc ring ball by the forehand or the backhand, the thumb and the forefinger do not exert force; the thumb does not exert force when the front hand is directly hit; the index finger can not exert force when the user directly beats against the hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0035" num="0033">The common disadvantage of the three types of rackets is that the flexibility of the wrist cannot be fully exploited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0036" num="0034">The three rackets cannot fully play the role of all fingers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0037" num="0035">Three types of racquets were not able to handle balls well in-table, near-table and near-body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0038" num="0036">None of the three types of rackets has a handle which is better in natural fit with fingers and palms.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0039">Disclosure of Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0040" num="0037">The invention provides a table tennis racket which can give full play to the flexibility of wrists.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0041" num="0038">The invention provides a table tennis racket which can fully play the role of fingers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0042" num="0039">The invention provides a bionic table tennis racket suitable for natural positions of fingers and fitting palms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0043" num="0040">The table tennis racket of the present invention is temporarily called a finger racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0044" num="0041">The finger racket of the invention is provided with a racket bottom plate and a three-dimensional racket handle. The racket handle is a three-dimensional racket handle formed by a ball of cleaning cloth which is held in the hand and the cleaning cloth follows the shape of the hand. The handle of the three-dimensional racket is provided with a first web gap and is arranged on the upper edge of the right side of the upward extending part of the handle of the racket board; a thumb hole, which is arranged at the right side of the upward extending part of the ball board and is naturally held by the thumb, and the fore finger belly of the thumb extends out of the hole; the index finger hole is arranged at the right side of the upward extending part of the ball board and at the place where the index finger naturally hangs down so as to lead the fore finger belly of the index finger to pass through; the middle finger hole is arranged at the center of the upward extending part of the ball board and at the position where the middle finger naturally hangs down, so that the middle finger belly of the middle finger can pass through the middle finger hole; and the transverse handle is arranged at an angle of about 90 degrees with the vertical direction of the ball board and horizontally extends towards the left side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0045" num="0042">The handle of the racket is made into a three-dimensional shape that the handle is naturally attached to the palm, the fingers and the tiger's mouth in a manner that the palm naturally holds objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0046" num="0043">The tiger's mouth gap of the handle of the ball board extends along the inner side and the outer side of the thumb. The upward extension part between the joint web and the thumb is called as the extension part outside the web gap; the part extending along the thenar of the palm is called the extension part at the inner side of the tiger's mouth gap. The extension part at the inner side of the tiger's mouth gap continues to extend transversely to the left side to form a transverse handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0047" num="0044">In one embodiment of the invention, an upwardly extending outside extension of the thumb gap passes around the back of the thumb at the back of the thumb to engage with an inside extension of the thumb gap to form a thumb trepan as a thumb tab.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0048" num="0045">The paddle handle of the present invention may further include a wrist engaging portion. In one embodiment of the invention, the outer extending part of the upward extending tiger's mouth gap extends to the position of the wrist, and a clamping elbow which is attached to the wrist can be arranged on the outer wrist to the inner wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0049" num="0046">The paddle handle of the present invention may further include a thumb stop. The thumb blocking part is arranged at the thumb end of the transverse handle and is an anti-skid blocking turning head turning downwards at the end part of the transverse handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0050" num="0047">The transverse handle is a part which is extended from the inner side of the tiger's mouth gap and horizontally extended towards the left side. The shape of the transverse handle can be long plate shape, cylindrical shape, or the shape fitting with the virtual hollow palm center, wherein the latter is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0051" num="0048">The handle of the table tennis bat can be made of wood, metal, plastic and other materials, and preferably plastic materials. Plastic materials are light weight relative to metals; compared with wood materials, the plastic is strong.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0052" num="0049">The table tennis bat handle can be connected with the ball board part by means of bonding and riveting, and the bonding mode is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0053" num="0050">The ball board of the bat of the present invention may be a conventional table tennis board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0054" num="0051">The rubberizing of the racket of the present invention may be a conventional rubberizing. The two sides of the adhesive tape can be the same or different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0055" num="0052">The user's thumb, through the first web gap and the thumb hole, holds the upper end of the handle from the upper part of the handle, the index finger and the middle finger respectively pass through the index finger hole and the middle finger hole, pulls the lower end of the handle from the lower part of the handle, holds the racket handle together with the thumb, the ring finger and the little finger hold the horizontal handle extending horizontally from the lower part of the horizontal handle, the thenar (thumb abductor) inside the palm presses the horizontal handle from the upper part, and holds the horizontal handle together with the ring finger and the little finger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0056" num="0053">When the racket is used, a player uses the middle finger to vertically hook the racket through the middle finger hole; the forefinger passes through the forefinger hole to stabilize the possible circumferential displacement and shaking of the racket; the thumb is matched with the middle finger and the index finger through the tiger mouth gap and the thumb hole of the ball board, and the upper edge part of the handle of the ball board is gripped; the thenar of the ring finger, little finger and palm is held transversely on the horizontally extending transverse handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0057" num="0054">When the finger bat of the invention is used, the holding postures of the bat are adopted, the fingers are mutually matched, the bat is firmly held from a plurality of directions, and the possibility that the bat takes off the hand when the bat is used for direct or horizontal bat and the force is too strong is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0058" num="0055">When the finger bat of the invention is used, the palm is completely attached to the bat handle by adopting the holding posture of the bat, the bat and the palm are combined into a whole, the ball board part is like the natural extension of the palm, and the action that the palm can do can be realized by the ball board. The ball can be played freely without being restricted by the racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0059" num="0056">The finger bat of the invention adopts the holding posture of the bat, thereby completely liberating the wrist. The wrist of a person can swing in the front-back direction of the palm and the back of the hand and can also rotate in the axial direction coaxial with the forearm. When the bat is used for playing a ball by a straight bat or a horizontal bat, the bat surface is required to be kept at a specific preparation angle according to the needs of the ball return action. In order to keep the bat surface at a specific angle, the wrist is adjusted to the specific angle in advance and is kept fixed, and when a bat is hit, the wrist is not moved any more, and the back stroke is finished by swinging the big arm and the small arm. The finger bat can be used for swinging the wrist to hit the table tennis at the moment of hitting the table tennis, and can flexibly and freely turn the wrist in the front-back direction and the axial direction of the wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0060" num="0057">The racket of the invention can not only hit balls by swinging the arms like the traditional racket, but also hit balls by swinging the wrist back and forth. The racket is particularly suitable for being kept on a near table, even if the racket does not go out of the table, the near table and a body pursuing ball can be pulled by the wrist, the pulling, poking and pushing processes can be carried out in a small motion mode, and the strength of the racket is not lost in the killing of direct shooting and transverse shooting. Because the close table is used for killing, bouncing or pushing, the ball returning speed is very high, and an opponent can be easily forced to return to the middle table or the far table, so that the initiative of playing the ball is mastered. The wrist is used for swinging the treatment ball, so that the action is small, sudden and hidden, and the sudden prevention of the opponent is often caused. Because the wrist swings to process the ball, the small rotation of the wrist can effectively change the angle of the table tennis, so that the sportsman can play the angle of the paniculate drilling without greatly moving to one side of the table to pull out the angle of the returned ball and standing on the table. Because the racket of the invention can swing the wrist back and forth to hit balls, the racket can conveniently use the other side of the racket board to hit balls for backhand balls, and does not need to directly shoot players, reluctant to reverse the wrist and use the front side of the racket board to hit balls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0061" num="0058">The finger racket of the invention adopts the holding posture of the racket, and fully plays the role of fingers. In the prior art, no matter which kind of racket, the fingers of the player need to tightly hold the racket handle, and the friction force between the fingers, the palm and the racket handle prevents the racket from falling off the hand under the action of centrifugal force. But the tighter the racket is held, the more the other functions of the fingers in playing the ball are affected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0062" num="0059">In the invention, the player hooks the racket with the middle finger, and the centrifugal force generated by swinging the racket is just opposite to the pulling force of the middle finger hook, so the handle of the racket does not need to be held too tightly. The holding of the racket is properly relaxed, and other functions of the fingers can be played. For example, when the wrist is swung to kill, the ring finger and the small finger held on the transverse handle can be released instantaneously so as not to affect the swing amplitude of the wrist. As the ring finger and the little finger are loosened, the horizontal handle of the racket can move towards the outer side of the palm center to a certain degree. The larger the outward motion amplitude of the horizontal handle of the racket is, the larger the inward rotation amplitude of the ball plate is, and the larger the hitting force is. When the wrist swings to the maximum, the middle finger hooks the racket, the middle finger serves as a supporting point of the racket, and the ball board which is not limited by the ring finger and the little finger can still move a little further towards the ball hitting point and is not influenced by the limit of the wrist. Thus, besides various resultant forces of the body of the player, the inertial motion of the racket can generate the effect of gravity acceleration, and the hitting force is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0063" num="0060">In the finger bat, a thumb, an index finger, a middle finger, a ring finger and a little finger can be matched with a wrist to perform rotary operation in sequence, wherein the thumb is firstly stretched outwards and inwards, then the index finger is stretched upwards and inwards, the middle finger is stretched upwards and inwards, and then the ring finger and the little finger perform the same operation as if the palm center of the hand has a ball and five fingers perform a rotary operation. The applicant names this as "finger swing". The swinging finger can pull out the arc rotary ball which rotates very fast and can not generate billiards, especially the ball which has no table, low ball and no swing arm space. The swinging finger is from the contact point of the table tennis bat surface contacting the table tennis to the overturn of the bat to an ideal position, and the amplitude of the rotation angle can be between 15 and 180 degrees and is determined according to the specific ball. The finger swinging action is an action which cannot be done by other rackets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0064" num="0061">For another example, the finger bat of the invention takes the middle finger as a central supporting point and takes the transverse handle of the bat as a lever, and the micro-motion of the ring finger and the little finger can change the angle of the ball board, thereby playing the ball with a certain angle. Besides the function of weighting and killing, the index finger can change the running track of the table tennis by the micro-motion when the index finger is pressed down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0065" num="0062">The holding posture of the bat is adopted, so that the bat not only completely retains the advantages of the prior penholder bat, transverse bat and gun bat, but also adds a plurality of variable bat methods, such as a killing method of swinging the wrist back and forth, a finger swinging method, a ping-pong ball drop point changing method by finger jogging and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0066" num="0063">The finger bat of the invention enlarges and increases the handle part, so that the weight of the handle and the ball board is more balanced, and the finger bat is not similar to the transverse bat and the gun bat in the prior art, and the center of gravity is always sensed to be forward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0067" num="0064">The finger bat of the invention has balanced gravity center, and the hand position is higher, but the hand holding feeling is close to the direct bat with lower hand position, thus being suitable for the quick attack of the near table by force. The finger bat of the invention is also suitable for all transverse bat playing methods, and is suitable for long-distance table ball cutting and arc drawing rotary ball.</div>
