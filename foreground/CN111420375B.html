<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003">Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0002">The base plate of the table tennis bat on the market at present still mainly takes light wood, has moderate performances such as density, elasticity and the like, gives consideration to comprehensive performances such as flexibility, ball control, speed and the like, and also accords with the consumption level of the public, so the base plate of the table tennis bat is the first choice for many years. Generally, the main wood of table tennis bat includes eucalyptus, forest wood, tung wood, spruce, basswood, juniper wood, walnut wood, etc., and its properties are all distinctive. However, the properties of various kinds of wood are greatly different, and natural factors such as growing regions, climatic conditions, whether rainwater is sufficient (water content) and the like have great influence on the characteristics of the wood; in addition, the cutting mode, the grain direction, the color difference, the knots, the mineral lines and the like of the wood in the processing process can greatly influence the performance of the racket, and the consistency of the performance of the wooden racket is seriously influenced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0003">With the continuous development of the table tennis level, the limitation that the elasticity and the strength of wood are insufficient is gradually highlighted, and the new requirements of higher hitting speed and stronger rotation cannot be met. Therefore, the multilayer laminated wood base plate and the interlayer made of new materials such as carbon fiber, aryl fiber and glass fiber with higher elastic modulus are added on the basis of the multilayer laminated wood base plate, and the development trend of the table tennis bat is formed. However, the new process is basically only modified on the basis of the original wood, only certain properties are improved to a certain extent, fundamental innovation is not provided, the weight is limited by the larger density of the wood material, the weight cannot be further reduced, and the transverse bat and the straight bat of the table tennis bat with the wood substrate are basically concentrated on 90-95 g and 85-90 g.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0004">Currently, in order to further reduce the weight of the table tennis bat and improve the control flexibility and the hitting speed of the table tennis bat, manufacturers try to combine a foam core material with a carbon fiber composite structure. Among them, CN107415281A describes a method for preparing a carbon fiber table tennis bat by self-expansion molding, which uses an ultra-low density polymer with self-thermal expansion as an inner core material, provides the functions of shaping and supporting, and obtains a table tennis bat product with very light weight. CN201710788184.6 also mentions that a table tennis bat is integrally formed by adopting foaming filler and carbon fiber, and the table tennis bat with good elasticity and light weight is obtained. However, the materials and the process have a very big defect, when the impact is small, the carbon fiber modulus on the surface of the racket exceeds 250GPa, so that the rigidity is too high, the ball holding time is short, the vibration attenuation time is long, the vibration feedback time is long and scattered, and the ball control and the hand feeling of the technical means such as ball twisting and pendulum are very poor; and when the impact is great, the strength of the low-density core material is low, and effective support cannot be provided for the carbon fiber layer on the surface, so that the efficiency of attack modes such as killing, large-force toroidal balls and the like is very low.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0005">The amorphous alloy is a new material with a unique atomic arrangement structure with long-range disorder and short-range order, the tensile strength of the amorphous alloy can reach 1800 plus 4000MPa or even higher, and the elastic modulus of the amorphous alloy is only about 70-80 GPa; more importantly, the elastic energy storage (elastic specific work) thereof exceeds 2.3 multiplied by 10<sup>7</sup>J/m<sup>3</sup>And the elastic limit can reach 2%. In addition, the unique atomic structure of amorphous alloys also makes them insensitive to stress-notches and very fatigue resistant. Therefore, the modification of carbon fiber composite materials, cement-based composite materials and the like by utilizing the unique amorphous mechanical properties is a research hotspot in the field of the current composite materials.</div>
