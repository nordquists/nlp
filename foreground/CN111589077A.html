<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003" num="0003">Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0004">People often encounter the situation that the side edge of the racket is knocked on the table tennis table to deform and even damage the local part of the table tennis table, and the situation is mostly caused by the wrong force-exerting posture of people. The table tennis bat base plate with the pure wood structure or the pure wood-sandwiched fiber structure can be seriously damaged due to quick and powerful collision, so that the appearance is influenced, the batting hand feeling of a user is influenced, and the service life of the table tennis bat base plate is further shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">The protective edge of the prior table tennis bat has very limited actual protective capacity to the bat, although the protective edge made of sponge material is light, the deformation of a bottom plate caused by high-strength collision cannot be prevented, and although the protective edge made of metal material has a certain protective effect, the gravity center of the bat is always changed after the protective edge is added on the bat due to the fact that the self weight of the protective edge is not small relative to the whole bat, so that the hitting hand feeling is influenced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0027" num="0027">The technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention will be clearly and completely described below with reference to the drawings in the embodiments of the present invention, and it is obvious that the described embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the present invention, and not all of the embodiments. All other embodiments, which can be derived by a person skilled in the art from the embodiments given herein without making any creative effort, shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.</div>
</mode-for-invention>
<mode-for-invention>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0028" num="0028">Example 1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0029" num="0029">As shown in fig. 1, the table tennis bat protective edge provided by the embodiment includes: a first layer 2;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0030" num="0030">the intermediate portion 4 of the first layer 2 is comprised of a shear thickening fluid material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0031" num="0031">In this embodiment, the central portion of the first layer 2 is a fabric that is impregnated with a shear thickening fluid, and the first layer 2 is bendable. The edge protector formed by Shear Thickening Fluid (STF) can reduce the damage caused by high-force collision to the maximum extent and simultaneously influence the batting hand feeling to the minimum extent. STFs differ from newtonian fluids in that their rheological properties vary with applied shear stress, typically in the form of slightly viscous dispersions, which undergo a sharp rise in viscosity upon exposure to high shear forces or shear rates, and ultimately exhibit a solid-like morphology. The shear thickening effect is also reversible, and when the applied stress is removed, the fluid can quickly return to the original form. The shear thickening fluid is infiltrated into the fabric, and once the fabric is impacted and compacted, the shear thickening fluid becomes a hard solid, so that the fabric is stronger and difficult to penetrate. Therefore, when the table tennis bat collides, the table tennis bat can be effectively protected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0032" num="0032">Both end portions of the first layer 2 are made of sponge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0033" num="0033">In the present embodiment, taking the view shown in fig. 1 as an example, the left end of the middle part 4 is the left end 3, and the right end is the right end 5; thus, the two end portions are constituted by the left end 3 and the right end 5. The lengths of the two ends may be the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0034" num="0034">The safe edge also includes: a second layer 1;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0035" num="0035">the second layer 1 and the first layer 2 are detachably adhered; the second layer 1 is the same shape and size as the first layer 2. The first layer 2 is strip-shaped. The second layer 1 is release paper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0036" num="0036">In this embodiment, the first layer 2 is coated with a glue layer on the bottom surface, and the second layer 1 is a release paper, so that the first layer 2 and the second layer 1 can be easily separated. After the release paper is peeled off from the bottom surface of the first layer 2, the first layer 2 can be adhered to the edge of the table tennis bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0037" num="0037">On the first layer 2, the middle part and the two end parts have a visible boundary line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0038" num="0038">In this embodiment, the parting line serves to facilitate shearing of the two end portions. Since the main function of protecting the table tennis bat is provided by the middle portion of the first layer 2, the end portions serve as an additional protection and facilitate the attachment of the middle portion. Firstly, as can be seen from the structure of the first layer 2, after the first layer 2 is adhered to the edge of the surface of the table tennis bat, the two end parts are close to the handle of the table tennis bat, and the probability of the handle being collided is small; therefore, the middle part is used for protecting the swatting surface in an important way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0039" num="0039">As shown in fig. 2, according to the structure of the table tennis bat:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0040" num="0040">if the perimeter of the surface of the table tennis bat is L and the length of the middle part 4 of the first layer 2 is L, then: l is more than or equal to 0.7L and less than L.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0041" num="0041">If the thickness of the bat surface of the table tennis bat is M, the thickness of the base plate of the bat surface of the table tennis bat is N, and the width h of the middle part 4 of the first layer 2 is as follows: h is more than or equal to M and less than or equal to N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0042" num="0042">In the structure, the length of the middle part of the first layer 2 is controlled to be between 0.7L and L, namely the upper half part of the edge of the table tennis bat surface is protected by the shear thickening fluid material; while the lower half near the handle may be protected by a sponge material or by a shear thickening fluid material. Therefore, the material cost of the edge protector can be saved. Another function of the two end parts of the sponge is to facilitate the sticking of the protective edge. When the table tennis bat is used, the second layer 1 is only required to be taken off, the lower surface of the first layer 2 with the glue layer is aligned with the edge of the table tennis bat and is attached, and then the redundant sponge at the two ends of the protective edge is cut according to the size of the table tennis bat. The function of the parting line is to facilitate the shearing of the two end portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0043" num="0043">In the above structure, the effect of setting the width h of the middle portion of the first layer 2 between M and N is to make the edge guard focus on protecting the racket base plate. Because the two faces of the racket face can be adhered with the rubber, the edge of the rubber is not easy to deform when colliding, and the bottom plate is mainly protected.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0044" num="0044">Example 2</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0045" num="0045">As shown in fig. 2, in the table tennis bat provided by the embodiment, a table tennis bat protective edge is adhered to the edge of the bat surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0046" num="0046">Table tennis bat safe edge includes: a first layer 2; the intermediate portion 4 of the first layer 2 is comprised of a shear thickening fluid material. The left end of the middle part 4 is a left end 3, and the right end is a right end 5, both of which are made of sponge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0047" num="0047">The structure of the safe edge satisfies:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0048" num="0048">if the perimeter of the surface of the table tennis bat is L and the length of the middle part 4 of the first layer 2 is L, then: l is more than or equal to 0.7L and less than L.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0049" num="0049">If the thickness of the bat surface of the table tennis bat is M, the thickness of the base plate of the bat surface of the table tennis bat is N, and the width h of the middle part 4 of the first layer 2 is as follows: h is more than or equal to M and less than or equal to N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0050" num="0050">The table tennis bat has a simple structure, is easy to use, and can reduce the damage to the table tennis bat caused by high-strength collision to the greatest extent; meanwhile, the batting hand feeling of a user is influenced to the minimum degree, and the service life of the table tennis bat is prolonged equivalently. The invention can also carry out personalized treatment of appearance color so as to modify the table tennis bat.</div>
