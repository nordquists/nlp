<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003" num="0003">Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0004">The traditional badminton is characterized in that a plurality of pieces of feathers are inserted into a badminton head, then two coils are wound, and then glue is added for reinforcement. The feather is natural feather of goose and duck. In order to reduce the manufacturing cost, artificial feathers are also used. However, no matter what kind of mode is adopted, the existing badminton is mostly suitable for indoor use, which is determined by the structure of the badminton. Because the traditional badminton has larger blades and more support rods (generally 16 feathers are adopted), the wind shielding area of the side surface is larger. If the badminton shuttlecock is used outdoors, even if breeze exists, the flight route of the badminton shuttlecock can deviate, and the use feeling is seriously influenced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">The utility model patent No. 201520751206.8 discloses an outdoor badminton, adopts uncovered design in the middle of its bulb, reduces the influence of wind to ball route. Meanwhile, the tail wing (equivalent to feather) is of a non-coherent design, and an air flow channel is further increased. Although the wind resistance is reduced, the design of the existing badminton is completely changed, and the use feeling is not ideal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0006">The utility model with patent number 201120294210.8 discloses a windproof badminton, which comprises an elastic ball and feathers, wherein the elastic ball and the feathers are connected by a wire. The feather of this badminton does not adopt the circumference to enclose the mode of closing, has reduced the area of keeping out the wind greatly, has nevertheless changed the structure of badminton completely, and the use is felt not good, and the flight is also unstable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0007">The existing outdoor ball has a big defect only in the two-section structure of the integrally formed ball body and the ball head: the gravity center of the outdoor ball is excessively concentrated on the surface of the ball head and the ball champion, the waist parts of the outdoor ball and the ball champion are light in weight, the shearing effect of force is mainly concentrated on the waist part of the ball after being hit, the waist part of the outdoor ball with the two-section structure is thin and weak, and the mass of the waist part is excessively small, so that the gravity center of the outdoor ball is unstable, and the flying stability is poor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0032" num="0032">Detailed Description</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0033" num="0033">The present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and specific embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0034" num="0034">As shown in fig. 1, a butt joint three-section outdoor ball comprises a spherical crown 1, a support 2 and a ball head 3, wherein the spherical crown 1 and the ball head 3 are fixedly connected through the support 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0035" num="0035">As shown in fig. 1 and 2, the spherical cap 1 is integrally formed, and includes a flared curved portion 11 and a circular docking collar 12. The curved surface part is divided into six parts by six support ribs 13, and the support ribs 13 can increase the strength of the spherical crown curved surface and reduce the deformation of the spherical crown curved surface in the ball flight. Each section has a plurality of airflow apertures 14 formed therein. The curved surface shape of each part and the shape and layout of the airflow holes 14 are the same, the airflow 14 of each part curved surface is non-uniformly distributed, and the heights of the curved surfaces of the two adjacent parts are different at the two sides close to the common support rib 13. In the present embodiment, on both sides of the support rib 13 in the clockwise direction, the curved surface of the latter portion is higher than the curved surface of the former portion. The air flow holes 14 may be in the form of strips, circles, rectangles or triangles, and the air flow holes in this embodiment are in the form of a combination of strips, rectangles and triangles. The support ribs 13 extend downwards to the butt joint ring 12 and are evenly distributed on the circular ring, and a flow guide hole 15 is formed between the curved surface part and the butt joint ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0036" num="0036">As shown in fig. 1, the bracket 2 is also integrally formed and includes a support rod 21, a connecting ring 22 and a base 23. One end of the six upright supporting rods 21 is positioned above the base 23, and the other end is uniformly arranged on the circular ring of the connecting ring 22. The number of struts 21 may be the same as or different from the number of support ribs. In this embodiment, the number of the support ribs 13 and the support rods 21 is six. If the number is different, in order to be able to equally divide and ensure the stability of the ball, the number of the supporting ribs 13 is twice of the number of the supporting rods 21, if adopting: 3 supporting rods and 6 supporting ribs; 4 support rods and 8 support ribs; 5 supporting rods and 10 supporting ribs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0037" num="0037">The base has a mounting portion 24 below it. The mounting portion 24 may have a cylindrical shape (see fig. 3), or may have a regular polygonal cylindrical shape (in the present embodiment, a cylindrical shape having a regular hexagonal cross section is used, see fig. 4). In order to reduce the weight of the ball, the cross-sectional shape of the strut 21 may be V-shaped, Y-shaped, U-shaped, E-shaped, T-shaped or cross-shaped, and a T-shape is adopted in this embodiment. A connecting rib 25 is arranged between two adjacent support rods 21, and the connecting rib 25 can be arranged in the middle or at the tail of the support rod 21. The connecting ribs 25 prevent the support rod 21 from shaking during flight, similar to the coil action on the feather rod of a traditional badminton.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0038" num="0038">As shown in fig. 5, the ball head 3 is a segment body with the segment height H larger than the ball radius R, so that the contact area between the ball and the bat can be increased, and the hitting angle is enlarged. The mounting groove 31 and the segment body are the same central axis. The mounting groove 31 is vertically opened downwards from the plane of the top surface of the ball head 3, and the shape of the mounting groove 31 is matched with the shape and the size of the mounting part 24.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0039" num="0039">The mounting slot 31 may be provided as an annular groove that matches the shape and size of the mounting portion 24, as shown in fig. 6 and 7, which correspond to the cylindrical mounting portion 24 of fig. 3 and 4, respectively. Cylindrical slots having an inner wall matching the shape and size of the outer wall of the mounting portion 24 may also be used, as shown in fig. 8 and 9, corresponding to the peripheral shape of the cylindrical mounting portion 24 of fig. 3 and 4, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0040" num="0040">After assembly, the butt joint ring 12 is in butt joint with the connecting ring 22 and is solidified by adding glue, the mounting part 24 is inserted into the mounting groove 31 for fixation, and the whole assembled ball is symmetrical about a central axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0041" num="0041">To facilitate the positioning of the docking collar 12 and the connection collar 22, the side of the docking collar 12 facing the cradle 2 has an opening, the side of the connection collar 22 facing the spherical cap 1 matches the opening in shape, and a part of the connection collar 22 is inserted into the docking collar 12 (see fig. 10). Alternatively, the side of the connecting ring 22 facing the spherical cap 1 has an opening, the side of the docking ring 12 facing the holder 2 matches the shape of the opening, and a part of the docking ring 12 is inserted into the connecting ring 22 (see fig. 11). By adopting the mode, on one hand, the assembly is convenient, and on the other hand, the connection strength is also improved. The opening can be a circular groove or a plurality of grooves uniformly distributed on one circumference.</div>
