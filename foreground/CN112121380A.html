<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA427420144">
<div class="abstract" num="0001">The invention provides a picket racket edge protection strip which comprises an edge strip body, wherein the edge strip body covers the end face of a racket, the edge strip body comprises side edges and flanges, the flanges are arranged on two sides of the side edges and are in a vertical structure with the side edges, the tail ends of the flanges are in an inclined plane structure, and the inner walls of the flanges are tightly adhered to the upper surface and the lower surface of the edge of the racket. The strake body adopts the plastics material to make through injection mold integration. The edge strip body is symmetrical from the upper part of the handle of the racket to the upper part of the other side of the handle of the racket by surrounding the racket. The outer surface of the joint of the side edge and the retaining edge is arc-shaped. The side edge and the flange of the edge strip are tightly attached to the racket. The integrally formed picket racket edge protection strip made of the plastic material through the injection mold is simple in structure, convenient to manufacture and low in cost, and the edge protection strip made of the plastic material is good in abrasive resistance and clamping degree, convenient to install by workers, convenient to replace and capable of reducing the defective rate.</div>
