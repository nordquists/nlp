<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0061" num="0061">The working principle and the beneficial technical effects of the technical scheme are as follows: the invention keeps the optimal selection of the filter screen by carrying out the limited design on the material and the structure of the filter screen. The invention firstly judges the gap between the filter screen and the air holes to prevent particles from entering the gap, and then substitutes the shape coefficient of the particles and the thickness of the filter screen for calculation to prevent the particles with different shapes from entering the filter screen to block the air holes. The invention also introduces non-filterable particles, the non-filterable particles have lower air permeability and filter screen loss capacity, moreover, the largest particle diameter in the non-filterable particles is smaller than the diameter of the mesh of the filter screen, and the mesh of the filter screen is smaller than the air holes in implementation. When the filter screen accords with the formula of the invention, the filter screen can prevent the influence of particles on the air permeability of the table tennis racket sleeve to the maximum extent, and has a good filter structure to prevent large particles from influencing the racket. The wear resistance of the table tennis bat sleeve is further processed within a period of time based on the hardness, elasticity and contact area selected by the material of the filter screen and the load capable of bearing, so that the wear resistance capable of bearing the table tennis bat sleeve is prevented from being lower than the influence of particles on the table tennis bat sleeve within a period of time (representing the service life of the table tennis bat sleeve), the table tennis bat sleeve can meet the requirement standard, and the service life of the table tennis bat sleeve is prolonged.</div>
