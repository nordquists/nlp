<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0002" num="0002">The utility model relates to a kind of table tennis bat, particularly relates to the improved table tennis bat of a kind of shank.</div>
</technical-field>
<background-art>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0003" num="0003">2, background technology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0004" num="0004">Technical background mainly comprises three aspects, and the technology of pen-hold grip shake-hands grip, the more improved innovation technology of shank part and table tennis technology are popularized beginner's specification requirement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0005" num="0005">Pen-hold grip and shake-hands grip respectively have advantage, and unvanquishable shortcoming is also respectively arranged, and this mainly is that structure causes because shank is held bat; Pen-hold grip is owing to the both sides that the finger of controlling angle and strength all concentrates on the batting district longitudinal central axis line symmetry of racket make pen-hold grip have good flexibility, feel and low-angle face variation efficiently, but pressure bat angle physiology curvature does not reach before the wide-angle of the froehand-backhand position of pen-hold grip, the big increase training of the mode operation easier of wristlock difficulty; The also motion-affecting enjoyment of uncomfortable factor, it is little to add the finger strength of holding bat, and particularly backhand strength is very little; This also needs a large amount of training to adapt to, and finger is also had and must injure, and racket batting district center is below the forearm extended line when also having it to hold bat naturally; And it is far apart from forearm extended line vertical range; This has influenced the power transmission efficiency of having an effect of flail type greatly, though the rapid and convenient that also is pen-hold grip on little trick is attacked, on the absolute strength that big-movement is had an effect less than one of reason of horizontal fearness; The characteristics of close-table persistent erection far from the table weak tendency have also just been formed; With regard to trend, select the new person of pen-hold grip fewer and feweri, still because the overall technology strength rising space of pen-hold grip is limited; Sum up; Pen-hold grip has the sharp advantage of feel, but froehand-backhand all has the twisting of joints, and backhand twisting of joints situation seriously causes backhand defense and attack leak, and this also is the core reasons that people less and less uses pen-hold grip among the existing professional athlete very greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0006" num="0006">The hold of shake-hand grip is that palm is held lever; Strength is very big, and batting is strong, but no matter is at forehand and backhand lifting the ball or square stance; Just impact all and need sink to accomplish clapping head in order to pull out high-quality screw or the ball of pressing close to table top to be quick attacked; This is because shake-hands grip racket batting district when holding bat naturally is in above the forearm extended line and vertical range is distant, and at first this has influenced the transmission efficiency of having an effect of the flail type that great has an effect, and next has only the district center of batting under the forearm extended line, to help impacting the bead of table top just now; Though heavy wrist can solve this two problems; But the wrist ligament anxiety that causes will cause locked wrist, influence this moment the having an effect and flexibility of wrist, this also is the reason that why shake-hands grip bead control and quick attack are worse than pen-hold grip; But the inconvenience that can let the player adapt to heavy wrist strap to a certain extent through a large amount of training with respect to the shortcoming of pen-hold grip shake-hands grip remedies; So we see what mostly their wrist when the professional athlete competes was to sink, but the inconvenience that the action of even so this violation Human Physiology curvature brings can't eliminate, and also affects the technology performance always.Heavy wrist phenomenon is relatively just few a lot of in the amateurish competitor, and still because this mode is very uncomfortable and need a large amount of training to adapt to, the attacking driving angle was restricted when the wrist ligament was in tension; The ball-handling of batting moment changes and to be restricted; Forefinger was in apart from the racket far position, sweet district of batting and also causes feel bad when shake-hands grip was held bat, and summed up down, and shake-hands grip has the anti-little advantage of leak of the long attack on both sides of moment; But shake-hands grip need exceed the heavy wrist of the normal free degree of wrist when handling for the close-table low ball; This also is tangible twisting of joints situation, but its relative pen-hold grip still has overall advantage, so generally adopt shake-hands grip among the existing professional athlete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0007" num="0007">For a long time; People also are to feel puzzled deeply for the problem of directly holding shake-hand grip; So there are a lot of innovations to occur; Wherein noticeablely be one type batting district center when holding bat naturally improved with respect to the racket handle structure aspect the arm extended line position; This improved purpose it is apparent that in order to solve the nature problem of wristlock physiology curvature in order to adjust this position that face batting district under the state run in the pen-hold grip below the forearm extended line and the shake-hands grip above the forearm extended line of holding bat, for example: a lot of similarly innovations such as zl200420047683.8, zl98205697.4 and zl99228224.1, all the position of batting face adjust near or relatively near the position of forearm extended line; But these innovative products but can't well be used in practicality; Its reason has 3 points, at first, though pen-hold grip and shake-hands grip all have the shortcoming of self; Do not have can not be through the have an effect defective of principle of the excessive violation that training is alleviated but can both accomplish basically to use; But because the innovation on the complete lattice almost has no basis and can use for reference, invention that can a lot of this improvement levers, the basic structure principle of all having violated control unintentionally and having had an effect; Can't remedy through training in causing using; Vertical Spin Control axle that to be the main vertical application of force axle of racket clap forward leaning angle with adjustment of most critical departs from racket batting district longitudinal central axis line greatly in these problems, claps the shape strength that wanders off when causing having an effect and can not concentrate the control that loses during the racket face brandished, and often controls with bead in the control of having an effect and causes a lot of errors; That is to say that these three axles of combination of realizing control and strength must overlap a line, is an individual still unsolved difficult problem but how to let the new design of these asymmetric complete innovation structures in left and right sides can meet this principle; Secondly; That the position of holding bat that has is leaned on very much is last, lean on very much too eminence that back or forefinger stick up in racket longitudinal central axis line top; Can not make palm, forefinger and thumb take into account the equilibrium control to each position of racket face, it is bad to the control in certain local batting zone of racket often, particularly the district of racket longitudinal central axis line below; And this part is the main region that impacts the small conversion control of bead, attacking driving and loop drive; If will cause the sweet district center of finger distance batting far away excessively after leaning on very much, feel is all bad with control, and error is a lot; In addition; Also have in some basic designs unreasonable; Such as; Longitudinal central axis line both sides, racket batting district difference in quality is too big, causes the center of gravity of racket to depart from racket batting district longitudinal central axis line greatly, and racket was clapped the appearance strength that is prone to wander off and can not be concentrated on the axis when flail type whipping was had an effect with small control; Also have the too narrow racket ball plate that causes of linking part of racket batting part and handle to tremble; Not obtaining the too big control of vibration of partly having the final say of square stance that enough supports of shank cause on some position of racket batting face loses accurate; Lever is too greatly too thick, can't finely tune when holding cause controlling dumb; The a lot of single finger-holes that are provided with that also have let finger insert the too dead of card when causing holding; It is bad or the like that small adjustment bat angle is inconvenient to control, and makes that these designs error in use much is difficult to again overcome through training, and finally can't popularize; These complicated and comprehensive detailed problems; Must consider all, and can well merge that not conflicting again each other is a complex task that practice is simulated and a large amount of theory analysises combines that needs are a large amount of through structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0008" num="0008">Table tennis bat is developed by tennis, claps head and reduces, and handle shortens; Netted face becomes the rubber face, and this all is in order to adapt to the characteristics of table tennis, is in order better to impact control; But we still face the very big equipment obstacle in using at present, played multiple sports ball game the people cognition is all arranged, crossing the threshold of table tennis wants difficult relatively; Can play a plurality of bouts to ball and do not slip up if play the both sides of ball, will practise at least under the amateurish situation more than half a year to one year, and shuttlecock or some other ball; Only need carry out being familiar with and being poised for battle once week even several days; This material that comes from present use on the one hand not enough outside the advanced person important reasons to be that our pen-hold grip of using and shake-hands grip are at present held very comfortable, but in use have the twisting of joints that much exceeds the wrist free degree to move, controlling well has an effect just need do a large amount of acclimatization trainings; In these training much is in order to deacclimatize the action of this non-natural physiology curvature; It seems that from pen-hold grip the card of finger symmetry is held in the both sides, axis of bat, application of force axle and inclination angle rotating shaft and axis overlap; So strength is concentrated; Controlling also finely, but also is that technology enforcement is more awkward because this mode of holding bat that is stuck in the finger causes just reaching to press and clapping angle in the lean forward wide-angle adjustment of pressing wrist when clapping must do distortion physiology curvature of forehand wide-angle and backhand wide-angle; Even if after the new technology that reversing penhold backhand appears in backhand, this mode of being held bat by several fingers does not change still that its strength is little also to have influence on amateurish competitor's technology performance with the training difficulty height of backhanding attack the limited fundamental drawback of angle and reverse penhold backhand; Face was above the forearm extended line when shake-hands grip was held bat naturally, and whole palm is held handle, and application of force axle and inclination angle rotating shaft and axis overlap; The grip foot, moment is long, and strength is big; But because the position in the sweet district of the relative batting of control finger forefinger and thumb the most flexibly is far away, the longitudinal central axis linear distance that the relative racket batting with the thumb tip in forefinger tip is distinguished is also far away; Angle variation control to racket is dumb relatively, and hand is also fine and smooth inadequately to the vibrations perception of clapping, and the most key is that face is above the forearm extended line; Meeting the square stance wrist, to brandish stroke leeway little, and forearm has been walked the L route to the strength transmission of racket head, often to have an effect very smoothly and impacts all and will avale clapping head in order to realize; Make the batting district center on the forearm extended line, this additional move not only can cause the reaction time slow, and the anxiety of wrist portion ligament is elongated axial rotation and the swing that also influences wrist; And then the accuracy and the angle-of-attack of racket control are limited, the bad grasp of amateurish competitor; More than these use difficulties of getting a penhold grip with shake-hand grip be mostly to overcome through a large amount of acclimatization trainings; The difficulty and increase amusement input cost grasped have been prolonged virtually; The China of highly-specialised is arranged just because of there is powerful training system to cause us to ignore the difficulty of its popularization of Sports easily for table tennis; This is exactly a threshold that gets into and improve for the amateur in fact; This also is why relatively one of reasons of the more difficult left-hand seat of other motions of table tennis, does not have abroad especially among the peoplely under the powerful national traditional system support to be difficult to improve one of reason with powerful.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0009" num="0009">3, summary of the invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0010" num="0010">The limited influence of physiology curvature when causing using in order to overcome existing pen-hold grip shake-hands grip handle structure; The twisting of joints is many, hinders the problem of technology performance, and the beginner grasps the high problem of the big raising threshold of table tennis difficulty; And the improvement of complying with the physiology curvature of table tennis bat---racket bat sweet district center when adjusting to nature and holding bat near the forearm extended line; And still can keep the good problem of having an effect and controlling, and it is a kind of that the utility model provides, and racket is batted sweet district center near the forearm extended line when holding bat naturally; Can realize coincide the human body natural's physiology curvature and the free degree; Striking plate is near the forearm extended line when holding bat naturally, realizes under the prerequisite of good strength transmission, and bead control no less than the existing racket that generally uses, the variation of attacking driving angle, force level and technological some specialities and overall strength such as comprehensive can also be arranged; And it is easy to use; Relatively in the past racket structure do not need too many acclimatization training learned to grasp by the beginner easily, key is to be fused in the wrist nature free degree, eliminates or significantly reduce the improved table tennis bat of shank of the twisting of joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0011" num="0011">The utility model is realized through following technical scheme:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0012" num="0012">Comprise striking plate, racket lever, finger-hole and projection composition; Finger-hole is positioned at the place ahead of lever; Projection is positioned at the top of lever; It is characterized in that: the summit of projection and lever formation groove is positioned at the longitudinal central axis line both sides that the racket batting is distinguished relatively with the closest approach finger-hole summit of finger grip axis, and between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of next side, finger-hole can pass three fingers simultaneously in the axis on the finger-hole summit.The structure of this lever makes goes smoothly when grasping; Forefinger root and thumb also can nature be fitted near batting district's longitudinal central axis line; The face that pinches racket longitudinal central axis line of nature; Racket face inclination angle, attacking driving angle and instantaneous variation there are excellent control and feel; This helps the transmission of strength and to impacting the perception of information feedback; This in addition groove apex and finger-hole summit lay respectively at below that combining structure that longitudinal central axis line both sides and finger-hole vertex position limit makes that also forefinger tip when holding bat is in the racket axis nearby, have only this position forefinger just can cooperate other fingers promptly the face of racket longitudinal central axis line upper and lower all to be had better controlled, if the forefinger tip is on the longitudinal central axis line or the top, axis all can't achieve this end; Middle finger, the third finger and little finger of toe pass finger-hole and hold lever; Give racket with the bigger amount of holding support; No less than shake-hand grip, contrast is got a penhold grip and shake-hand grip on the strength, and the batting district center of racket is positioned on the forearm extended line perhaps more near extended line; The strength transmission efficient of batting is higher than straight shake-hands grip; Face and palm are in almost same plane, and this also makes the perception of going smoothly to face position, angle, vibration and variation all more clear, and froehand-backhand leans forward and presses the variation of clapping with the attacking driving angle convenient just as the adjustment palm; But racket swing angle degree is big a lot; Almost there is not the twisting of joints; Can in physiology curvature scope, just can satisfy the needs of nearly all routine techniques; Can not make wrist tight as the wrist that hangs of shake-hands grip, can be as the froehand-backhand wide-angle of the getting a penhold grip difficulty the face that leans forward yet, whole palm is held to be greater than on the handle strength and is got a penhold grip; In bead control; Because forefinger and thumb are closely clamped the face at the longitudinal central axis line position in racket batting district, forefinger is more near the racket sweet district that bats, finger the sweet district that bats is controlled and perception clear; Cause the bead control of little strength fine; This point is compared forefinger and is had a clear superiority in bead control away from the bat shake-hand grip in sweet district of ball racket, and the grasping of nature and the action of complying with human body natural's physiology curvature more meet the human physiological structure than existing pen-hold grip and shake-hands grip on the whole, and the beginner spends less time to do adaptation training relatively; Use also relative comfort, improved interest the table tennis motion; The more crucial key finger that control is clapped when being to use the utility model structure lever---thumb and forefinger just is fitted near the longitudinal central axis line that the racket batting distinguishes; Reach out below and be fitted in longitudinal central axis line below, racket batting district nearby of the finger tip of forefinger; The regional feel control of the main face zone that this point is handled bead---racket longitudinal central axis line below is fine; And have only this position just can take into account the control to zone, racket longitudinal central axis line above and below, because we are in bead is controlled, what major requirement was controlled is the zone of the longitudinal central axis line below of racket; Mainly impact the position that point of contact is racket longitudinal central axis line top when loop drive and attacking driving; But the motor-driven variation of control that all are tiny and moment many in the bottom, axis this position accomplish, controlling the bottom of racket longitudinal central axis line after all well is exactly the key that has obtained control, this also is the unique distinction in this type of innovation design; In addition; The structure of the utility model is used does not fast have the twisting of joints freely, mainly be that the improvement through structure has realized application of force axle, Control Shaft and three unifications of rotating shaft, this overcome racket in use do not meet the problem of having an effect with control principle; The utility model makes forefinger balanced to the feel and the control ratio at position, longitudinal central axis line both sides, racket batting district; The forefinger finger tip is in racket longitudinal central axis line below nearby naturally, and the froehand-backhand bead is controlled good hand touch freely, and finger can also be finely tuned to racket longitudinal central axis line during forehand attack; Obtain stronger attacking driving batting, the perception to batting all is superior in the past to the improved similar invention of lever with control on the whole; More than these improve and all to have realized do not lose contact with reality the again architecture advances of result of use of the existing advance that meets the Human Physiology curvature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0013" num="0013">Such scheme can also be done further improvement through following measure:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0014" num="0014">The summit of groove is between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of a side on the longitudinal central axis alignment in racket batting district.This scope can be so that projection be tightr to the engaging of tiger, is fit to more with the sane running game of holding bat, and especially cooperates behind the lever of wide-angle to embody its sane fast bat along structure and describe and be prone to fixing technological speciality.Such as behind the lever along 30 spending downwards in the axis to 76 degree with the angle of axis, and make projection have living space in this position to do bigger, the batting moment of both sides, axis also is to help improving the effect that impacts strength simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0015" num="0015">The summit of groove is positioned at a side on the longitudinal central axis alignment in racket batting district, more than or equal to 2.5 centimetres, and is less than or equal to 6 centimetres apart from the axis.This scope makes projection loose to the engaging of tiger, is fit to the arc type play to hold bat lax more.Particularly after cooperating low-angle lever, during along structure, more can embody the good technological speciality of the strong loop-drive of the big defence of strength of the position of holding bat on clenching fist axially.Such as behind the lever along downward 5 spending to the axis upwards 5 degree in the axis with the angle of axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0016" num="0016">The line that finger-hole is walked summit upwards and groove apex with lever after the angle on edge spend to 90 60 and spend.The summit is a point of walking top upwards at finger-hole; Said angle is aft-opening; In this angle, could make simultaneously finger-hole, groove and lever can nature in applying finger, the centre of the palm and tiger, keep movable freely flexibility in sane effectively holding bat, if tiger can not fit to groove when the angle angle can cause or hold bat greater than this angular range; Grasping is empty excessively; Be that the lever angle causes inadequately, or the finger-hole position is low excessively, forefinger and thumb can accurately not pinch the longitudinal central axis line; These all can make very few or do not have suitable grasping place and influence control to the attachment point of racket; If the angle angle can cause groove that the card at tiger place is pressed tension less than this angular range, perhaps too high forefinger that causes in finger-hole position and thumb are not pinched and can accurately be pinched the longitudinal central axis line, and same influence is to the control of racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0017" num="0017">Behind the lever along 30 spending downwards in the axis to 76 degree with the angle of axis.Hold the back along being straight line, in the bigger angular range of this relative longitudinal central axis line, do not have the twisting of joints on the free degree of each technical movements in the time of making the use racket; And have only the free degree that equipment uses and the wrist nature physiology free degree this effect just can occur when coincideing, no matter the free degree coincidence palm free degree that the racket when this angle is described uses is almost not have the twisting of joints when rubbing with the inclination angle bouncing; Very flexible, the same as palm, help the performance freely of various technology; If the summit of engagement groove is this condition between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of a side on the longitudinal central axis alignment in racket batting district, well balance racket lever makes racket control well away from the center of gravity of longitudinal central axis line; More can bring into play behind this lever along angle bring last quick-moving; Impact effectively, conversion is fast, and flexibility is high; Angle of trajectory is difficult for the technical characterstic of judgement; The play type that realized flexibly fast, the unexpected all round quick attack of attack combines loop-drive, wherein angle is 45 to spend to 76 degree downwards in the axis the most flexibly, and the angle with certain flexibility and strength is 30 to spend to 44 and spend downwards in the axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0018" num="0018">Along downward 5 spending to the axis upwards 5 degree with the angle of axis in the axis, and finger-hole walks summit upwards is in groove on longitudinal central axis line direction the place ahead, summit behind the lever, and and along the fore-and-aft distance of axis more than or equal to 1 centimetre.Along being straight line, this angle that forms with the axis had both made racket batting district and grasp axis be on the same straight line, equally brandished effectively as holding a rod when holding bat behind the handle, and it is long-pending wide to protect table top; The position of clapping head simultaneously is lower than shake-hands grip again, and finger is more to the control that racket is participated in, and feel is better; And reduced the twisting of joints influence when low ball handled than shake-hands grip, and left-hand seat and conversion be also all faster than shake-hands grip, and wherein best angle is downward 2 to spend to the axis upwards 2 degree in the axis; And finger-hole is walked summit upwards is in groove on longitudinal central axis line direction the place ahead, summit, and fore-and-aft distance the best is 2 centimetres to 4 centimetres, as combining; The summit of groove is positioned at a side on the longitudinal central axis alignment in racket batting district, more than or equal to 2.5 centimetres, and is less than or equal to 6 centimetres apart from the axis; The best is at 3.4 centimetres to 5.5 centimetres, and this feasible strength of not only swinging the bat is big, and it is long-pending wide to protect table top; Froehand-backhand does not have leak, lacks easier left-hand seat in the platform than the shake-hands grip twisting of joints; About conversion also faster, angle of trajectory also is not easy to be judged than shake-hands grip more, forms all round play type of being good at loop-drive and defence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0019" num="0019">Lever 2 is flat and vertical range is narrower than the other end near an end width of axis 7.Lever 2 thickness are less than the narrow lower end of width and upper end, and I not only can enrich more in hand and strengthen grip, and can also have and rotate flexibility preferably; Its reason possibly be wide inner-cavity structure when just meeting the people and hold thing; This up-narrow and down-wide structure also makes to go smoothly has the perception at the vertical elevation angle of tangible face and the horizontal elevation angle of face to bat, root religion carefully can make hold when finger loop is firmly had an effect steady, and the bottom is wide to be helped the control at inclination angle and the increase of batting moment of torsion; The control great efforts that the lever broad of bottom is horizontal to face; Improve stability when helping the attacking driving of impact type, and, especially play crucial effect for the control of racket longitudinal central axis line below to the also more clear convenience of finger adjustment at the racket elevation angle; This structure is fit to the shape of palm fully; Make the applying nature, just can hold slightly firmly that loosen slightly just can be flexible with a firm grip, strengthen control and reduce and adapt to difficulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0020" num="0020">The lever forward position is a straight line with the edge, back, and their angle is spent to 30 degree 5.This angle staff that coincide grasps that to clap be the pyramidal structure of inner chamber, and gives certain variation space, the palm of can more steady applying stopping; Also not malfunctioning activity of while, angle too small does not have the taper effect, and palm bottom is empty when holding bat; The incessantly lever of fitting, influence be to the control of racket, and angle is crossed then auger and spent greatly; The wide palm that blocked in bottom, making does not have the bad rotation wrist of flexibility to have an effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0021" num="0021">Finger-hole top is provided with the beam that can block middle finger near lever one side.Middle finger and nameless control and moment of torsion to bottom, racket axis face have been strengthened in the setting of this beam greatly; Make that batting is more sane when control of froehand-backhand bead and froehand-backhand assault; Control more accurate; Because after outstanding beam blocks middle finger, increased finger to the torsion of racket, to the sensitivity of racket angle variation and the sensitivity that racket is trembled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0022" num="0022">Cantilever thickness is thinner than lever.Beam is the part of racket plate body, and the lever sheet is not pasted in both sides, so not only produces easy; Also make finger sharp more to the variation and the control of bat angle, beam can be protrusion lever forward position, and parallel with the lever forward position; Have of the control of the middle finger of great more like this to racket; Can be straight line with the lever forward position, just the lever sheet not be pasted in the beam both sides yet, though like this on the moment of torsion strength rotation of slightly little racket in hand more flexible; The lower end of beam can extend to the bottom in lever forward position; At this time beam is very long, and this will have to improve to greatest extent points the control strength of racket and the characteristics of having an effect, but movable flexibility in hand is affected slightly for racket.This structure makes middle finger can apply bigger torsional forces to racket with nameless, and obtains to tremble more clearly feel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0023" num="0023">The angle in beam edge and lever forward position is spent to 35 degree 0.Be towards the racket plate face of racket longitudinal midline bottom at the edge of this angle central sill, and the fine applying of can be well pointing with middle finger etc. of finger face, the control of plate body has especially been strengthened the control of bottom racket plate face greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0024" num="0024">The anterior integral body of lever is opening V font forward.This makes middle finger can hold the outstanding part in top; Play excellent handle and control to the racket zone of racket longitudinal central axis line bottom; Nameless then can enclose the effect that lever plays firmly grasping; Little finger of toe then plays auxiliary holding bat and the effect of controlling the inclination angle substantially, and this structure more can be brought into play the not function of finger than straight structure, with the enforcement that helps technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0025" num="0025">Lever 2 the narrowest place width are between 3 centimetres to 4.5 centimetres.The lever of the utility model is different with in the past rod-type lever moment; Moving towards in lever also need be than high pulling torque power on the subvertical direction; Meanwhile need take into account for the rotation of clapping in hand, this for the lever width the arrowhead at narrow place make and be used for having an effect that finger also can enclose lever and form very stable grip at the existing enough moments of torsion of square stance; The influence that also is unlikely to simultaneously wide grasping is rotated flexibly, and its width the best is at 3 centimetres to 4 centimetres.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0026" num="0026">The end of lever along the end of axis direction and projection along the axis direction is being less than or equal to 3 centimetres along the distance on the direction of axis.The best is to be less than or equal to 2 centimetres.The restriction of this tip dimensions not exclusively is in order to make the quality of racket longitudinal central axis line both sides obtain balance; The more important thing is; Can make the mass distribution of racket longitudinal central axis line both sides reach dynamic balance like this, make racket batting batting moment of torsion, the feel of batting and brandish control, all improve a lot; This distribution equilibrium is one of the most critical factor of the accuracy of the trickle control of influence; Affect the performance of high level technology, especially behind the lever along 30 spending when 76 spend lever to depart from the axis a lot of downwards in the axis with the angle of axis, the effect that the structure of this balance plays is more remarkable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0027" num="0027">At the device that increases the weight of that is provided with on the projection except that racket batting plate body; At this time impacting ball or arcing circle all can make the strength of batting by significant increase; This is owing to can increase the weight of the above racket body quality of racket longitudinal central axis line, improves the effect that impacts strength and more can play the weight increase that this a part of quality increases the whole symmetry of comparison racket, and this comes from actual when impacting ball; Impact point is basically all above racket longitudinal central axis line; Like this with respect to the table tennis of very light weight, add weight can obtain tangible striking force in the time of batting lifting here slightly, if at projection distribute some apertures or draw-in groove; Hole or draw-in groove are provided with the weight that can dismantle at any time and adjust the installation site, and weight can be middle nut and the nut that is added with elastic washer.The distribution in hole can be two rows of horizontal vertical intersection, and this adjustment can change the size of batting transverse and longitudinal striking force, when weight is installed in the hole at projection rear; When being installed in the hole of front, square stance is owing to receive the resistance of weight, and deformation strengthens on the racket longitudinal direction; The holding time of batting is long, and is and full of potential, during hole above being installed in projection; The weight of racket longitudinal central axis line upside strengthens, and it is faster relatively more effectively to go out ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0028" num="0028">Be carved with decoration flower shape on the projection or the accessory that has figure is installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0029" num="0029">The another kind of technical scheme that realizes the utility model is following:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0030" num="0030">The improved table tennis bat of a kind of shank; Comprise striking plate, racket lever, finger-hole and projection composition; Finger-hole is positioned at the place ahead of lever, and projection is positioned at the top of lever, it is characterized in that: the summit that projection and lever form groove is positioned at longitudinal central axis line or its downside that the racket batting is distinguished; Apart from 0 to 1.5 centimetre on longitudinal central axis line; Between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of next side, and groove apex is less than or equal to the distance of finger-hole summit apart from racket longitudinal central axis line apart from the distance of racket longitudinal central axis line in the axis on the closest approach finger-hole summit of finger grip axis, and finger-hole can pass three fingers simultaneously.The present technique scheme equally also makes relative pen-hold grip of racket and shake-hands grip more near the position of forearm extended line, and strength transmission efficient is high, the free degree of the gentleer wrist of the free degree of its use own; Also do not have twisting of joints situation in the use, the combination of structure limits and also makes when holding bat tip be in below the racket longitudinal central axis line nearby, can just realize racket whole control and perception; Finger is strong to the grip of racket, and is no less than shake-hands grip, bigger than pen-hold grip on the strength; And the application of force axle, Control Shaft and the rotating shaft that have solved racket merge problem, make brandish in more freely, its projecting point is that the groove apex position is in the axis to 0 to 1.5 centimetre of next side; Go up technical scheme variation relatively not quite though the variation of this position causes the material of both sides, whole racket axis to distribute, the kneading point of forefinger and thumb is in the bottom, axis, and this change makes with the technical characterstic difference of last scheme very big; The characteristics that the technology that makes is used are outstanding more distinct, and wherein main variation is, the strength that impacts of ball is increased substantially; Quick attack technology performance during technology is implemented becomes very outstanding; Feel to bead is also fine and smooth more clear, and difficulty increases slightly but the flexibility of the rotation of racket becomes, and this forms the play style of another kind of unique style; Racket with the outstanding quick attack that directly impacts technology with the outstanding feature of the fine and smooth feel of bead processing; The outstanding technical style that has challenge more of the outstanding difficulty of the speciality that the control difficulty also strengthens simultaneously, wherein reason possibly be the longitudinal central axis line below of the racket that is offset to slightly by application of force axle, control rotating shaft, causes the batting moment on rotating shaft top to increase greatly; Thereby make striking force increase significantly not adding under any accrete prerequisite; In addition, the position of forefinger finger tip also moves down relatively, for serve as that acumen and clear is more revealed in the bead control table in main batting district with racket longitudinal central axis line bottom mainly; When but move the position of being in one's hands; The rotating shaft of racket also is displaced to racket longitudinal central axis line bottom slightly, and the difficulty when this has brought the relative non-migration in the control needs to improve the control ability of self; But this product with conspicuous characteristics also has the significant effect in its actual use, becomes a kind of product of clear-cut individuality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0031" num="0031">Above-mentioned another kind of technical scheme can also be done further improvement through following measure:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0032" num="0032">Behind the lever along 30 spending downwards in the axis to 76 degree with the angle of axis.The technical style that is in this structure of this angle is brought into play more significantly; Wherein the best be in the axis downwards 45 spend to 76 kilsyth basalts the most outstanding at present; Its reason possibly be that the direction of trend and palm of racket longitudinal central axis line at this time is approaching; If the perception that causes impacting uses palm general, brandish freely.It is outstanding especially to have formed quick attack strength, and the two sides close-to-table fast attack has the very outstanding play type of certain challenging characteristics in versatility and the control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0033" num="0033">Finger-hole top is provided with the beam that can block middle finger near lever one side, and its thickness is thinner than lever.Beam is the part of racket plate body, and the lever sheet is not pasted in both sides, so not only produces easy; Also make finger sharp more to the variation and the control of bat angle, beam can be protrusion lever forward position, and parallel with the lever forward position; Have of the control of the middle finger of great more like this to racket; Can be straight line with the lever forward position also, just paste and the lever sheet beam both sides, though like this on the moment of torsion strength rotation of slightly little racket in hand more flexible; The lower end of beam can extend to the bottom in lever forward position; At this time beam is very long, and this will have to improve to greatest extent points the control strength of racket and the characteristics of having an effect, but movable flexibility in hand is affected slightly for racket.This structure makes middle finger can apply bigger torsional forces to racket with nameless, and obtains to tremble more clearly feel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0034" num="0034">Lever is flat and vertical range is narrower than the other end near an end width of axis, and tapered, and angle on edge is spent to 30 degree 5 before and after it, can be more substantial in this structure is held in the hand, and simultaneously also can flexible conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0035" num="0035">The end of lever along the end of axis direction and projection along the axis direction is being less than or equal to 3 centimetres along the distance on the direction of axis.The best is to be less than or equal to 2 centimetres.This structure makes the material moment of distribution of both sides of longitudinal midline of racket reach balance, and the effect of significant increase control is arranged as far as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0036" num="0036">The line that finger-hole is walked summit upwards and groove apex with lever after the angle on edge spend to 90 60 and spend.This also makes goes smoothly to the control of racket not only effectively but also have flexibility, key to be because this structure makes the applying of finger-hole, lever and groove part hand when holding bat can the harmonious degree of tightness appropriateness that reaches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0037" num="0037">At the device that increases the weight of that is provided with on the projection except that racket batting plate body; Perhaps increasing the weight of device is mounted on some apertures that are arranged on the projection; And can in time adjust the position, thereby the horizontal longitudinal moment of scalable batting changes technological tactics dynamically, increases changes in technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0038" num="0038">More than summit in all said schemes, its confining spectrum be walk top upwards in regulation the degree of depth in 0.15 cm range have a few.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0039" num="0039">More than related possible camber line in all said schemes, measure and other line between angle the time, be to measure as a result of as slotted line with the line at the two ends of this camber line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0040" num="0040">The utility model is compared following advantage with prior art: the structure of the utility model makes the longitudinal central axis line in racket batting district near the forearm extended line; Forefinger root and thumb all are fitted near the longitudinal central axis line in racket batting district; The forefinger front end is near the racket longitudinal central axis line below, and the sweet district of distance batting is very near, and middle finger, the third finger and little finger of toe can both be at the firm handles of holding under the state easily naturally; This structure makes: with respect to getting a penhold grip and shake-hand grip what generally use at present; The sweet district of batting of clapping under its situation of holding bat naturally is more near the forearm extended line, when having an effect the high loss of strength transmission efficient little, have an effect smoothness freely; Have an effect and control easily, froehand-backhand all need not adopt the position of adjustment racket such as the means of hanging wrist and forearm extended line just can send very big strength; And because the wrist rotation is unrestricted; But the swing angle degree is big; No matter the forehand backhand still is middle road, can both in the physiology curvature scope of nature, accomplish that easily this point is that pen-hold grip and shake-hands grip are not available by the armrest wrist for the adjusting of clapping forward leaning angle and the adjusting of angle-of-attack; Hold bat naturally down the residing position of face on the forearm extended line or the bottom very nearby, these two positions almost are to attack the optimum position that starts, and need not as shake-hand grip, adjust the position of bat and arm, have moved little so a lot, left-hand seat is also fast; Forefinger and thumb are clamped near the racket body the racket longitudinal central axis line; The forefinger tip is very near the racket sweet district that bats; This causes pointing perception to racket, control, inclination angle, and to change that vibrations change etc. more clear, also makes to be superior to shake-hands grip greatly very near pen-hold grip in the processing of bead; Forefinger stretches to the place ahead and is in the below, axis nearby, makes finger reach comprehensive control for the face of both sides, axis; On the whole, revolve on, underspin, loop-drive still be that attacking driving, bead processing etc. all do not have technical obvious leak, because the zone position of holding bat and bat more meets the physilogical characteristics of human body; Racket is as the prolongation of palm; Use also and feel very freely, racket structure can just can be grasped with less time relatively in the past, and it is also strong to have an effect; The hidden variation that moves freely is many, is easy to left-hand seat; With respect to improved invention in the past to the position of holding bat; Also having obtained progress, mainly is to show that control and the precision had an effect are significantly improved, and its reason possibly be that adjusting rotating shaft and the application of force axle at inclination angle of racket is on the axis; Perhaps very near apart from the axis; Its makes the application of force axle have an effect and the rotating shaft at inclination angle can not too depart from racket batting district longitudinal central axis line, and the quality of longitudinal central axis line both sides, racket batting district wants basic equity and center of gravity on the axis, and the finger of major control racket apart from the sweet offset of batting from will be closely; Feel control for racket is all fine; Key is that the forefinger front end is positioned at racket longitudinal central axis line below nearby, and the batting to the longitudinal central axis line both sides in racket batting district of having only that this position can general equilibrium has better controlling, is unlikely to cause the blind area of controlling; For the beginner, the nature of holding bat is near the prolongation of palm, and control is got up just relatively easy a lot; There is not the code requirement of wristlock, upward quick-moving and the ABC of easy yet; Froehand-backhand does not have obvious leak, can form the combination of multiple product characteristics, increases the kind of racket technology style; Also increased the interest of table tennis motion, helped the fan and select with widely universal.The improvement of clappers does not have complicated structure in addition; Production cost and technology with existing product do not have obvious variation, and the production conversion cost of carrying out new product is little, can continue to use for the auxiliary facility of having the final say, rubber, packing etc. yet; Need not independent adjustment, reduced use cost to greatest extent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0048" num="0048">Below in conjunction with accompanying drawing the utility model is further specified:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0049" num="0049">The utility model embodiment is just like Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 7 and shown in Figure 8; Comprise striking plate 1, racket lever 2, finger-hole 3 and projection 6 compositions; Finger-hole 3 is positioned at the place ahead of lever 2; Projection 6 is positioned at the top of lever 2, and the 5th, the lower edge of projection 6 is characterized in that: the summit 8 of projection 6 and lever 2 formation grooves is positioned at longitudinal central axis line 7 both sides in racket batting district relatively apart from the closest approach finger-hole summit 9 of axis 7 with finger-hole 3; Between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of next side, finger-hole 3 can pass three fingers simultaneously in axis 7 on finger-hole summit 9.The summit 8 of groove is at the longitudinal central axis line 7 in racket batting district upwards between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of the side.Finger-hole 3 is walked the line 16 of summit upwards 14 and groove apex 8 and is spent to 90 degree 60 along 4 angle with lever 2 backs.Lever 2 back 7 30 is spent to 76 degree downwards in the axis with the angle of axis 7 along 4.Wherein angle is 7 45 to spend to 76 degree downwards in the axis the most flexibly, and the angle with certain flexibility and strength is 7 30 to spend to 44 and spend downwards in the axis.Lever 2 forward positions 15 and back be along 4 be straight line, and their angle spends to 30 5 and spend, and finger-hole 3 tops are provided with the beam 10 that can block middle finger near lever one side, and beam 10 thickness are thinner than lever.Beam 10 is parts of racket plate body, and the lever sheet is not pasted in both sides, and is as shown in Figure 8; Beam 10 can be protrusion lever forward position 15, and parallel with the lever forward position, has the control of the middle finger of great more to racket like this; Also can be as shown in Figure 7, beam 10 is point-blank with lever forward position 15, just the lever sheet is not pasted in beam 10 both sides; But though like this on the moment of torsion strength rotation of slightly little racket in hand more flexible, the angle in beam 10 edges and lever 2 forward positions 15 is spent to 35 degree 0.Lever 2 the narrowest place width are between 3 centimetres to 4 centimetres.The end of lever 2 along the end of axis 7 directions and projection 6 along axis 7 directions is being less than or equal to 3 centimetres along the distance on 7 directions of axis.The best is to be less than or equal to 2 centimetres.For nut and nut and the device 12 that increases the weight of that has an elastic washer are mounted on the aperture 11 that is arranged on the projection 6, and can adjust the position at any time, the arrangement of aperture 11 can be as shown in Figure 1, and horizontal vertical two rows are arranged, and intersects in projection 6 front lower places.The lower edge 5 of projection 6 is an arc, by the summit (8) of groove to terminal chord length 2.5 centimetres to 7 centimetres.This dimensional structure makes when nature is held bat racket batting district just near the forearm extended line, and it is smooth and easy all to have an effect than shake-hands grip and pen-hold grip, is all strong big outstanding feature of loop-drive or attacking driving, and relative shake-hands grip need not sunk wrist; Wrist is comfortable naturally not tight, but the swing angle degree is big, just can not cause the racket discomfort that leans forward, the obstacle that angle-of-attack is limited yet; And, go out ball circuit the other side and be difficult for judging that attack to threaten and strengthen, froehand-backhand can be attacked complex art strength and be better than pen-hold grip because wrist is flexible; Do not have obvious leak, forefinger and thumb pinch racket longitudinal central axis line, below forefinger reaches out; Can take into account the control everywhere of racket batting district, the sweet district of tip distance is nearer than shake-hands grip, and is better to the feel of ball; Strength transmission is fast, and left-hand seat is faster than shake-hands grip, vertical application of force axle of racket, regulates the rotating shaft and the three-way coincidence of racket longitudinal central axis line at inclination angle; Meet and have an effect and control principle, projection 6 plays balance racket longitudinal central axis line both sides quality and blocks the stable effect of clapping shape of tiger, controls and clap shape when having an effect can not wander off; The up-narrow and down-wide structure that meets staff of lever, grasping is comfortable firm, also not malfunctioning work; More practical more than the existing innovation invention that racket batting district is improved on the forearm extended line, embodiment one is fit to implement quick attack and combines loop-drive, with fast with become strong, all round technique and tactics play of main comprehensive strength.Embodiment one has solved the table tennis bat twisting of joints problem that is of long duration; Technology leak problem; And the problem that combines of bead technology and comprehensive strength play comprehensively flexibly fast; Particularly make, also can convert the play type that strength does not have leak comprehensively into quick loop-drive and the type that the quick attack technology is combined into the core play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0050" num="0050">The utility model embodiment two is like Fig. 3 and shown in Figure 4: with the difference of embodiment one be; The longitudinal central axis line 7 that the summit 8 of groove is positioned at racket batting district is a side upwards; More than or equal to 2.5 centimetres, and be less than or equal to 6 centimetres apart from axis 7, the best is 3.4 centimetres to 5.5 centimetres.7 upwards 5 degree 7 downward 5 are spent to axis with the angle of axis 7 in the axis along 4 in lever 2 back; Its best is 7 downward 2 to spend to the axis 72 degree upwards in the axis; And finger-hole 3 is walked summit 14 upwards is in groove on the longitudinal midline direction 8 the place aheads, summit; And 7 fore-and-aft distance is more than or equal to 1 centimetre along the axis, and the best is at 2 centimetres to 4 centimetres.There is not the end of lever 2 being less than or equal to 3 centimetres restriction among the embodiment two along the distance on 7 directions of axis along the end of axis 7 directions and projection 6 along axis 7 directions; This is because lever is distributed near near the racket longitudinal central axis line basically; Weight and moment are cheaply very little; So very little projection 6 also can enough play balanced action, projection 6 is provided with two apertures 11, and weight 12 can be adjusted conversion between two apertures.Embodiment two has solved, and the bead of one type of racket that the defence good strength of racket batting district above the forearm extended line is big when holding bat is naturally handled has the twisting of joints, slow with one's hands on the close-table; Change the bad problem of slow feel, embodiment two when holding bat naturally, need not sink wrist; Racket batting district, at this time, need not too sink wrist for the processing of bead in the platform and solve more near the forearm extended line than shake-hands grip; Do not have the twisting of joints, and because the batting district is lower, forefinger and thumb pinch easily on the racket longitudinal central axis line 7; And the sweet district of finger distance is nearer than shake-hands grip; So better feel and left-hand seat speed are arranged, because the free degree improves and the ball angle and be difficult for to judge relatively also and help attack that the speed of changing about it is also quicker; The advantage that faster speed is arranged than shake-hands grip when having great with comprehensive defence, the characteristics play type that does not have obvious leak that versatility is good at loop-drive and defence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p0051" num="0051">The utility model embodiment three is like Fig. 5 and shown in Figure 6: comprise that striking plate 1, racket lever 2, finger-hole 3 and projection 6 form; Finger-hole 3 is positioned at the place ahead of lever 2; Projection 6 is positioned at the top of lever 2; It is characterized in that: projection 6 is positioned at longitudinal central axis line 7 or its downside that the racket batting is distinguished with the summit 8 that lever 2 forms groove; With longitudinal central axis line 7 distance be 0 to 1.5 centimetre, its best is at 0.5 centimetre to 1 centimetre, finger-hole 3 apart from the closest approach finger-hole summit 9 of axis 7 in axis 7 between 0 to 2.5 centimetre of next side; And groove apex 8 is less than or equal to the distance of finger-hole summit 9 apart from racket longitudinal central axis line 7 apart from the distance of racket longitudinal central axis line 7, and finger-hole 3 can pass three fingers simultaneously.Lever 2 back 7 30 is spent to 76 degree downwards in the axis with the angle of axis 7 along 4.The technical style that is in this structure of this angle is brought into play more significantly, and wherein the best is 7 45 to spend to 76 kilsyth basalts the most outstandingly at present downwards in the axis, and finger-hole 3 tops are provided with the beam 10 that can block middle finger near lever one side, and its thickness is thinner than lever 2.Beam 10 is parts of striking plate 1; The lever sheet is not pasted in both sides, so not only produces easyly, makes finger sharp more to the variation and the control of bat angle yet; The lower end of beam 10 can extend to the bottom in lever forward position 15; At this time beam 10 is very long, and this will have to improve to greatest extent points the control strength of racket and the characteristics of having an effect, but movable flexibility in hand is affected slightly for racket; This structure makes middle finger can apply bigger torsional forces to racket with nameless, and obtains to tremble more clearly feel.Lever 2 is flat and vertical range is narrower than the other end near an end width of axis 7; And it is tapered; The angle on edge is spent to 30 degree 5 before and after it, and the end of lever 2 along the end of axis 7 directions and projection 6 along axis 7 directions is being less than or equal to 3 centimetres along the distance on 7 directions of axis.The best is to be less than or equal to 2 centimetres.Finger-hole 3 is walked the line 16 of summit upwards 14 and groove apex 8 and is spent to 90 degree 60 along 4 angle with lever 2 backs.The narrowest place of the width width of lever 2 can be fit to children and use at 1.5 centimetres to 3 centimetres, is carved with decoration flower shape 13 on the projection 6 or the accessory that has figure is installed, and increases the cultural personal color of product.The lower edge 5 of projection 6 is an arc, by the summit 8 of groove to terminal chord length 2.5 centimetres to 7 centimetres.Embodiment three has solved, and has the quick attack class technology that impacts strength greatly and is guaranteeing how to realize versatility under the outstanding prerequisite of technical characterstic, and the froehand-backhand equilibrium does not have the problem of leak, forms the outstanding especially all round play type of quick attack strength.Relative embodiment one; The quick attack power of embodiment three has more outstanding feature, and it almost is the technical scheme of pure quick attack type, because the turning cylinder of racket and racket longitudinal central axis line parallel and distance is a little arranged; This point this means in the control that racket rotates bigger slightly than preceding two embodiment difficulty; So be not suitable for implementing the big loop-drive technology in face inclination angle, but it also forms the reason of the characteristics of outstanding quick attack just, is enough to make it that tangible technical advantage is arranged.</div>
