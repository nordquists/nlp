<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><ul class="description" lang="EN" load-source="google" mxw-id="PDES207702636">
<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" num="0001">There are rackets for ball games z. As table tennis, tennis or badminton rackets in various designs known.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" num="0002">Depending on the design, these clubs have predetermined playing characteristics. also with regard to the impact force. So z. As a racket with higher dead weight a greater clout than a light racket. It is known that the impact force is greatest when the center of gravity is in the front of the racket. However, this requires a greater amount of effort from the player, especially in the wrist. The invention has the task z. B. to develop a table tennis rackets, in which the center of gravity is wrist-friendly in the vicinity of the handle or end of the handle is present and only moves forward when playing forward. Or a balance weight ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) According to the desire of the player is brought by mechanical action in a desired position. This is inventively achieved in that the racket weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) which are infinitely adjustable or are brought into front positions only when playing by centrifugal force. So z. B. weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) in a guided tour ( <figref> 4 </figref> ) or spring-mounted in a tubular hollow body. This hollow body is inserted in a bore of the racket handle and held by jamming. It is also thought that in the guide sleeve ( <figref> 4 </figref> ) movable weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) by means of flexible connections ( <figref> 12 </figref> ) with others in the ball impact surface ( <figref> 8th </figref> ) ( <figref> 3 </figref> ), and moved in existing cavities. It is also envisaged that the weighting elements consist of magnets which are placed in a guide ( <figref> 4 </figref> ) are mounted opposite pole and thus form a magnetic suspension. By slight or strong movement of the racket or the weighting element ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) brought more or less in the front area of the racket handle, so that the impact force is more or less increased by shifting the weight, so that when strong movement of the racket, the impact force on the ball is greatest. By the mechanical suspension; or by magnetic suspension, the weighting element ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) brought back to its original position after every stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" num="0003">Depending on the nature of the guide sleeve and the additional reinforcement of the club grip. In a continuously variable impact power amplifier ( <figref> 2 </figref> ) is z. B. the weighting element in the guide or sliding sleeve ( <figref> 4 </figref> ) guided against rotation on a threaded rod and changed by pressing the thread of the desired impact force of the player accordingly. The threaded rod ends with a receptacle for manual adjustment z. B. with slot for screwdrivers or hexagon and the like; or ends as a twist grip at the end of the club grip. The sliding sleeve is held by jamming, or is firmly connected to the racket handle. For optical control it is provided that the racket handle has a viewing window and markings on the window of the handle and or on the weighting element ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) available.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" num="0004">In the guide sleeve ( <figref> 4 </figref> ) are optionally provided on the inner ends elastic buffer discs. In the end of the sleeve, an adjustable limiting element is provided which the stroke of the or the weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) certainly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" num="0005">It is also contemplated that the outer end of the sliding sleeve to be provided with a rotatable end cap with eccentric, which also serves as an end cap for the racket handle and as a detent of the inserted percussion amplifier. It is also conceivable that the weighting element ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) is suspended on a spring or other elastic body and stored in a guide. The guide sleeve has inside elongated depressions or elevations, which provides a precise guidance of the weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) and prevent Luftwiederst√§nde. According to the invention it is also provided that by centrifugal force or by rotational movement preferably at the handle end via movable and or flexible connections weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) can be moved in the ball impact area to adjust the strike force according to the game property of the player. It is also conceivable the annular weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) are present on a rod guide or on the extension of z. B. a badminton racket handle are available. These weighting elements are covered with a sleeve. The weight of the weighting element ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) and the spring force are chosen and adapted to the racket accordingly. By handy insertion of the percussion amplifier ( <figref> 2 </figref> ) ( <figref> 7 </figref> ) of the racket, weights of the weighting elements ( <figref> 3 </figref> ) can be easily changed.</div>
