<div class="abstract">In comparison with known wood-and-foam-rubber bats, this design combines heavier outer layers with reduced overall wt., and also gives extra resilience by virtue of the hard sheets of laminate set between the inmost and the outer layers. The outer silicon-rubber layer, which is about 3mm. thick, is mfd. by a process which gives it both an interior full of bubbles of uniform size and a compact, smooth surface; various grades can be made and put to use. The inner layer consists of a light hard foam core about 5mm. thick, between sheets of hard laminate each about 0.6mm. thick; again various grades of wt. and stiffness are envisaged.</div>
