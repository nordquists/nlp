The plywood layer in the striking area (A) of the blade (X) is different from that on the handle (F), where at least one plywood layer (2,5) of the striking area with a transverse grain adjoins in the area of the blade of the bat another layer of plywood (3,6) forming part of the bat handle and having a grain extending in a longitudinal direction. The layer in the grip and striking area composed of a veneer with varying grain directions are interior layers which are covered by outer layers (1,7) with grains extending longitudinally.</div>
