<div class="abstract">The table tennis bat with a plywood surface (1) covered on both sides by a honeycomb or waffle patterned resilient layer (2) has a thin resilient layer (3) on the outside of these two layers. The projections (5) forming the pattern are shaped as square pyramids which face inwards towards the plywood. The two resilient layers are vulcanised together. The inner patterned layers incorporate a thick flange (7) all round the outside. The projections are between 1 and 3.5 mm high, and the whole layer (2) is between 1.5 and 4 mm thick and has a Shore hardness of between 40 and 50. The outer layer is between 0.05 and 0.20 mm thick and has a Shore hardness of between 20 and 30. Other proportions are specified, and the spaces between the projections can be filled with a plastics or rubber foam.</div>
