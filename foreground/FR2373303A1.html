<div class="abstract">The table tennis bat has a handle which is not positioned in the direction of the axis of the striking surface but in the general direction of an axis offset from its centre. The handle can adopt a number of different shapes and could be joined at more than one point, forming a closed hand grip instead of the usual handle. It has the advantage of being designed to suit left or right handed players.</div>
