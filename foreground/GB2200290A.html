<div class="description-paragraph">Table Tennis Bat
This invention relates to a table tennis bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally a table tennis bat consists of a handle and blade; it is usually made of plywocd. Tne playing surface of the blade is cov-ered with the sponge rubber. There are two common types of grips used to hold a conventional table tennis bat, the pen-holder grip and shake-hand grip. The shake-hand grip is widely used in Europe and most other Continents except for Eastern Asia. It is also known as the European grip. The pen-hclder grip is popularly used in Asia; it is attributed to their way of life and the habits of muscular movement. The pen-holder grip, with very few exceptions, is usually confined to the forehand playing surface. It is always considered suitable for attackers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the handle, which is thicker than the blade, is shaped to fit snugly into the palm of the hand. A recess is provided for the placement of the thumb and the grooves for guiding the fingers to be inserted into holes, or another recess for the littlefinger. The size of'the handle, its thickness, its shape, the size of the recess, and the size and position of the holes are varied to suit the fingers and the palm of the player. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The new bat is designed to incorporate the advantage of the pen-holder grip forehand stroke and ccmiDensate for the weakness of the pen-holder grip backhand by replacing the latter with shake-hand grip backhand stroke. The handle is designed in such a way that the -grip used by the player is a combination cf the shake-hand grip and pen-holder grip. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With this grip, better control of the blade is provided as the blade is designed to be an extension of the palm. The holes, recess(es) and grooves are made in such a way that the fingers are held naturally together, neither too close nor too far apart, to form a secure, firm and comfortable grip.   </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the blade is designed to be orientated at such an angle that it provides an optimum orientation of the sponge rubber playing surface and enables the player to pick up the ball at the earliest time. With a better controlled bat and optimum orientation of the playing surface, it minimizes the percentage of error in the playing stroke. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by the way of the example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which :
