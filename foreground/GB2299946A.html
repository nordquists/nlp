<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA7030608" source="translation">
<div class="abstract">A bat or racquet for a new game has a frame 10 and two handles 12 and 13 which are gripped in both hands and used to turn the bat over to enable the player to present both sides of the striking surface 14 to an approaching ball 28 or projectile. A latex membrane 14 is stretched across the rim 11 and inserted in the holding 15, so that the striking surface may flex when a ball or projectile is struck. The membrane acts as resilient striking surface that reduces the torque movement of an off-centre strike. It is thus suited for small children. The bat or racquet 29 is intended to be used to propel a ball or projectile for recreational and sporting purposes.</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES144243640">
<div class="description-paragraph">GAME APPARATUS
This invention is related to the general field of sporting goods and game apparatus. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates more particularly to games in which contestants propel a ball or projectile to each other, by striking it with a bat or racquet either with or without a net being part of the game apparatus. There are many games which involve propelling a ball or projectile with a bat or racquet over a net. One such game is tennis. Games such as beach tennis bats that use no net are also known, but it is an object of the present invention to provide a new game which can be played anywhere, either with or without a net and which gives young and old excellent enjoyment and exercise. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The solid-faced racquets used in the above games require that the ball or projectile be struck near their centre for a smooth impact. If it is struck near the perimeter, a jarring movement is transmitted along the handle and into the wrist of the player. If the player is not strong enough to resist this movement the racquet may twist and return the ball off-line. Wrist inflammation may also be caused by prolonged use, particularly in the case of young children. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is known that flexible striking surfaces tend to alleviate this problem to some degree. For example, striking surfaces made from stretch fabrics are known to transmit a smaller twisting movement from an off-centre hit, but are limited in their level of responsiveness and also the velocity and distance that they can propel a ball or projectile. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One object of the invention, is to provide a racquet with a striking surface that is able to propel a ball or projectile at a high velocity and distance, whilst requiring minimum striking force by the participant. With the bat or racquet described here, participants will be able to propel a ball or projectile more accurately, with any twisting caused by an off-centre hit being counteracted by the bat being held in both hands and having a latex striking surface.   </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Whilst maintaining the same two handed grip on the bat, the game is played by the participant using both sides of the striking surface, actually tuming the bat over during play. The choice of which side of the striking surface is to be used, will be dictated by the trajectory at which the ball or projectile reaches the participant. For example1 a high ball will require the use of the front side of the striking surface, whilst a low ball will be best struck with the rear side. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In effect, the position of the participanrs hands whilst holding the bat during a game, are similar to the striking surface a volleyball player creates with his own hands. Indeed the game is played like volleyball, but with the bat substituting the need for a participant's accuracy in hand positioning or strength in physically having to strike the ball themselves. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above objectives are accomplished by the following bat or racquet. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, there is provided a game apparatus comprising a bat or racquet, including two handles attached to a plastic frame surrounding a latex membrane, which is stretched across it so that the striking surface may flex when a lightweight ball or projectile is struck. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which:
Figure 1 shows in perspective a racquet according to the present invention and ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 2 is an exploded view of the bat of Figure 1, illustrating the components of the bat and their relationship to each other. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 3 is a rear view of the racquet showing also the method of holding it to play using the front of the striking surface. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 4 is a front view of the racquet showing also the method of holding it to play using the rear of the striking surface.   </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to the drawings, the bat comprises a generally circular frame 10, circular rim 11, two handles 12 and 13, and latex membrane 14. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the currently preferred embodiment, the frame is integrally moulded plastic material in the shape of a circle, having approximately thirty centimetres diameter and handles being eight to ten centimetres long. Although the frame in the depicted embodiment is a circle, the term "generally circular" as used herein will be understood to include ovals of the type commonly used in bats and racquets. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A thin latex membrane 14 is stretched over and glued to the rim 11. Any picture, logo or pattem can be readily printed on or applied to the latex material using well-known techniques. The rim and attached membrane is then inserted into holding 15. Frame section 17 is then secured to frame section 16 with screws 18, 19, 20 and 21 which locate in screw housings 22, 23, 24 and 25. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Handles 12 and 13 are glued into locating holes 26 and 27. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The bat is intended to be used with a lightweight ball 28 which is stuck with both sides of membrane 14. When ball 28 is struck, the latex membrane stretches to provide a cushioning effect to the impact reaction transmitted back through the player's hands, but unlike soft cushioning, the latex quickly rebounds to return energy to propel the ball. The latex further reduces the torque movement of an offcentre strike. Figures 3  &amp; 4 show the correct ways to hold and position the bat when using both sides of the striking surface.  </div>
