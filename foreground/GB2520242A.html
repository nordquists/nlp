<div class="description-paragraph">TABLE TENNIS BAT </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Field of the Invention </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a table tennis bat and to a layered structure arranged to be applied to a blade of a table tennis bat. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such a layered structure. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Background to the Invention </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Table tennis (or ping pong as it is more colloquially known) is a popular sport played over a table tennis table. Each player uses a table tennis bat (otherwise known as a racquet or paddle) to alternately bounce a table tennis or ping pong ball from one end of the table to the other, much like tennis. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Table tennis bats 10 (such as the one shown in Figure 1)typically comprise a wooden base structure 12 (known as a blade) consisting of a handle 12a formed of multiple plies and a flat, circular playing portion 12b. One or more sheets or layers of material, such as sponge and/or rubber 14, are applied to both sides of the playing portion 12b to provide a suitable surface against which a table tennis ball 16 may be struck. The rubber for example provides a degree of elasticity and grip that allows a user to strike a ping pong ball so as to impart spin, etc. The rubber layers on either side of a table tennis bat are usually colour-coded (red on one side and black on the other), thereby allowing a player to clearly see whether the opponent's forehand or backhand is being used during play. Whilst this is useful, it would be preferable if a table tennis bat could be further customised according to a player's playing and personal preferences, in particular in a social table tennis environment. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention seeks to provide such an improved table tennis bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Summary of the Invention </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention seeks to provide a table tennis bat allowing improved user personalisation and customisation. In a first aspect, there is provided a layered structure arranged to be applied to a blade of a table tennis bat. The layered structure comprises an at least partially transparent first layer. In some cases, the first layer may be fully transparent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As known in the art, a blade of a table tennis bat comprises both the handle of a table tennis bat and the (typically) wooden flat, circular playing portion to which layers of material may be applied. According to the inventive layered structure, the at least partial transparency of the first layer allows a user to see the blade of the table tennis bat and anything printed on the blade, even when the first layer is applied to the blade. Thus, for example, if the bat owner's name is printed on the blade, the owner may be able to rapidly identify their bat. In addition, the at least partial transparency of the first layer may allow a user to identify any damage incurred by the blade over the lifetime of the bat. It is envisaged that an image could be printed on the blade or else may be formed within the blade itself, for example through a particular method of manufacture of the blade. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferably, the layered structure further comprises a second layer joined to the at least partially transparent first layer. Thus, the at least partial transparency of the first layer may allow a user to see the second layer and anything printed on the second layer when the layered structure is applied to a blade. Again, if a unique image is printed or otherwise formed on or in the second layer, the owner may be able to rapidly identify their bat. In addition, the at least partial transparency of the first layer may allow a user to identify any damage incurred by the second layer over the lifetime of the bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first and second layers may be joined directly or indirectly. For example, a glue or other adhesive layer may be placed between the first and second layers so as to join or affix them one to the other. Other means of joining the first and second layers may be provided. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second layer may comprise an image formed thereon such that the image may be seen through the at least partially transparent first layer. For example, an image may be printed on the second layer, or the second layer itself may form the image (for example with different portions of the second layer being coloured with different materials). The image may be any desired image or pattern, and for example the image may be the bat owner's name, or a representation of them (such as a photo). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second layer may comprise a vinyl layer. A vinyl layer may allow an image to be printed on the second layer with greater ease. In addition, the vinyl layer may be self-adhesive. Thus, the vinyl layer may be applied directly to any layers adjacent to it, without the need for any additional joining means such as a separate glue or adhesive. The vinyl layer may be applied and may adhere directly to the table tennis blade. The vinyl layer may adhere directly to the first layer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The at least partially transparent first layer may comprise translucent silicon rubber. Silicon rubber may advantageously provide the table tennis bat with a level of playability that is comparable to traditional ping pong bats, in terms of elasticity, tackiness for spin, speed of bounce, etc. Thus, a table tennis bat may be formed wherein an image may be viewed on the playing surface of the bat, whilst the bat may retain the typical playing characteristics expected of a table tennis bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferably, the at least partially transparent first layer is about 0.5 mm thick at 40 shore thickness. The silicon rubber may be fully transparent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The layered structure may further comprise a third layer joined to the second layer. The third layer may provide a user with greater flexibility and choice in designing and tailoring the bat to their specific requirements. For example, in one embodiment the third layer may comprise foam or sponge. Foam/sponge is typically used as an underlayer to an upper rubber layer, and assists bounce, spring and power characteristics. The thicker the foam/sponge, the faster the bounce. Thus, a triple-layered structure may be formed wherein each layer may be formed of a different material, thereby allowing a user to form a tennis table bat with variable playing qualities, depending on the materials that have been used. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The layered structure may further comprise an at least partially transparent fourth layer joined to the at least partially transparent first layer and the second layer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With a fourth layer, even greater flexibility is provided to the user when constructing their bat. The at least partial transparency of the fourth layer allows a user to view the second layer through the first and fourth layers. The fourth layer may comprise a double-sided adhesive. The double-sided adhesive provides an efficient means of joining the first layer to the fourth layer, as well as the second layer to the fourth layer. Various different materials may be used to form the fourth layer, thereby allowing the user to impart other effects to the bat during play. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The at least partially transparent first layer may comprise a plurality of protuberances. Such protuberances, or pimples, may take various shapes and sizes and may aid the characteristics of the first layer in terms of table tennis playability. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The protuberances may be disposed on either the non-playing side of the first layer, the playing side of the first layer, or both. The non-playing side should be taken to mean the side directed toward the table tennis blade, whilst the playing side should be taken to mean the side directed away from the table tennis blade. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one embodiment, the blade (or at least the playing portion of the blade, i.e. without the handle) may be partially or totally encased or otherwise sheathed in an at least partially transparent first layer. This could be achieved for example by dipping the blade in liquid silicon rubber. Such a sheath would cover the edges of the bat, that is to say the peripheral portion separating one playing side from the other. This sheathing or encasing method may be used on a blade with other layers already pre-affixed or joined to the blade, for example with a foam layer and/or image layer already joined to the blade. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a table tennis bat. The table tennis bat comprises a blade and a layered structure applied to the blade. The layered structure is in accordance with any of the above-described embodiments. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blade may comprise an image formed on or in it. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a table tennis bat. The method comprises applying an at least partially transparent first layer of material to a blade of a table tennis bat. The method may also comprise joining a second layer of material to the at least partially transparent first layer, for example before applying the resulting bi-layer structure to the blade. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a kit of parts. The kit comprises a blade of a table tennis bat, and an at least partially transparent first layer of material for applying to the blade. The kit may further comprise a second layer of material for joining to the at least partially transparent first layer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a layer of material arranged to be applied to a blade of a table tennis bat. The layer comprises an image formed thereon. Therefore, with a single sheet or layer of material with an image formed thereon (or in some cases formed within the layer itself), a user may create a personalised table tennis bat by applying the layer to a blank table tennis blade. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Using the inventive method, a user may create personalised table tennis bats whereby the first layer effectively acts as a window through which may be seen the blade of the table tennis bat, or any layers positioned between the blade and the window' layer. With an image printed or otherwise formed on or in the blade or any such underlayers, the table tennis bat may be made more visually distinctive and may assist with rapid and easy identification of table tennis bats. The invention may therefore help reduce the number of thefts of table tennis bats, since for instance the second layer (for example with the owner's name emblazoned on it) cannot be easily removed without causing visible damage to the first layer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Brief Description of the Drawings </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various embodiments of the invention will now be described in connection with the accompanying drawings, of which: Figure 1 is of a perspective view of a typical prior art table tennis bat and ball; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of a layered structure according to a preferred embodiment of the invention; Figure 3A is a view of a first side of a bat using a layered structure according to an embodiment of the invention; Figure 3B is a view of a second side of the bat of Figure 3A; and Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of pimples that may be formed on the layered structure of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention seeks to provide an improved table tennis bat. Whilst various embodiments of the invention are described below, the invention is not limited to these embodiments, and variations of these embodiments may well fall within the scope of the invention which is to be limited only by the appended claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 2 shows a layered structure 20 according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. Layered structure 20 is seen applied to a blade 12 of a table tennis bat (such as the table tennis bat of Figure 1). Layered structure 20 comprises four layers 21, 22, 23, and 24 of different materials. A process used for forming layered structure 20 will now be described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process begins with a blank wooden blade 12 of a table tennis bat. Blade 12 comprises a handle 12a (not shown in detail) and a blade playing portion 12b. A foam cover 21 is first applied to blade playing portion 12b. Foam cover 21 assists bounce, spring and power characteristics of the table tennis bat, and, in general, the thicker foam cover 21 is, the faster the bounce. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A self-adhesive vinyl sheet 22 is then adhered to foam cover 21. The specifications of a preferred vinyl sheet are set out in Annex A, and vinyl sheet 22 may be a DFP 40 sheet manufactured by Asian®. In one embodiment, vinyl sheet 22 has a full five-colour CMYK image printed on the playing side of vinyl sheet 22. The playing side may be said to be the side facing away from blade playing portion 12b. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The image may be printed using solvent inks on a Roland VersaCAMM® printer. For example, the bat owner's name or face may be printed on vinyl sheet 22. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A double-sided clear glue sheet 23 is then applied to vinyl sheet 22. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifications of a preferred glue sheet 23 are set out in Annex B, and glue sheet 23 may be an ELASTOSIL® R pIus 4001 manufactured by Wacker Chemie AG. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Finally, a translucent silicon sheet 24 is applied to glue sheet 23. In a preferred embodiment, silicon sheet 24 is 0.5 mm thick at 40 shore thickness. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although not shown in Figure 2, silicon sheet 24 may be moulded to comprise a plurality of protuberances, nodules, bumps or pimples as known in the art. Pimples (seen in more detail in Figure 4) may aid the characteristics of silicon sheet 24 in terms of table tennis playability. They may be extend either away from a playing side or a non-playing side of silicon sheet 24. The units in Figure 4 are millimetres. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Of course, the dimensions of pimples 40 may vary and are not restricted to those shown in Figure 4. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, with layered structure 20 applied to blade 12 as seen in Figure 2, a personalised, customised table tennis bat may be manufactured. Manufacturing of the bat may simply involve a user applying the different layers in the comfort of their own home. In addition, due in part to silicon sheet 24, the playability of the bat is retained whilst allowing players and audience members alike to see during play the image printed on vinyl sheet 22. The image may comprise for example an advertisement, a logo, or a representation of the bat's owner, etc. Although not shown in Figure 2, the same or even a different layered structure may be applied to the reverse side of blade 12. In particular, a different image may be printed on a vinyl sheet disposed on the reverse side. Thus, for example, a table tennis bat may be formed whereby on one side of the bat a representation of the owner's face may be seen through the translucent silicon layer, whilst on the reverse side the owner's name may be seen. As will be appreciated the extent of such personalisation is effectively limitless. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figures 3A and 3B show embodiments of a table tennis bat 30 formed using the process described in connection with Figure 2. In particular, a different image can be seen on each side of bat 30, such that on one side of bat 30 a first image 32a may be seen, whilst on the other side of bat 30 a second, different image 32b may be seen. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Whilst in the preferred embodiment of Figure 2 a four-layer structure has been described, it is possible for the layered structure to comprise fewer or even more layers that are affixed to the table tennis bat. For example, in one embodiment it need only be necessary for vinyl sheet 22 and silicon rubber 24 to be adhered to blade 12. In such a case, other adhering means may be required to ensure proper adhesion of vinyl sheet 22 to silicon rubber 24. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In other embodiments, the layered structure may be packaged separately to the table tennis blade. In table tennis this has its advantages since professional players often prefer to have the freedom and flexibility to construct their own bats by applying different layers of material to the blade according to their own individual preferences, in order to achieve bats designed for different playing styles. Thus, the present invention may take the form of each individual layer being individually packaged with instructions for a user to then apply them one by one to a table tennis blade. In addition, such packaging may include one or more blank vinyl sheets (or other suitable layers) ready for one or more images to be printed on them before the layers are applied to table tennis blades. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Any feature of the above-described embodiments may be combined with the features of another embodiment, by making the appropriate changes. Whilst the invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to these embodiments, and that alterations, modifications, and variations of these embodiments may be carried out by the skilled person without departing from the scope of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, an image need not be printed on a layer but instead may be embedded in the material of the layer. In such a case, it is envisaged that according to the invention only a single layer need be applied to a table tennis bat. Purely as an example, a bat may be formed using only the above-described first layer applied to the blade. The layer may be translucent or transparent silicon rubber that is injection moulded such that an image is formed in the first layer. The specifications of such a silicon sheet are contained in Annex C, and the sheet may be a BISCO® HT-6240 transparent solid silicone sheet manufactured by Rogers Corporation. As another example, the first layer may comprise different coloured pimples such that a recognisable pattern may be formed, providing identification means for the bat. </div>
