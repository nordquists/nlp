<div class="description-paragraph">Summary of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention there is provided a table tennis device comprising a handle and a blade, wherein the blade comprises an extendable ball collector, the ball collector comprising a head, which head is arranged to pivot to engage a ball for collection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments the collector comprises an elongate member, which member supports the head. The member may be substantially rigid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments pivoting is achieved by use of a pivot between the elongate member and the head, which pivot enables the head to pivot axially with reference to an axis described by the member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The member may be coaxially telescopically arranged to extend from the blade of the bat, for example wherein the blade comprises a compartment within, and the member and head are arranged to locate into this compartment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compartment may comprise a lid or cap, which lid or cap is arranged to close over the compartment and may present an unbroken surface to the blade edge when closed in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The member in particular, and/or collector in general, may be arranged on a spring biased extending mechanism, such that release of the collector, for example displacement of the cap, may enable the collector to extend automatically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The head may comprise a ball attachment means, which attachment means may enable the collector to attach the ball to the head at a distance, or automatically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments the pivoting of the head on the pivot enables the attachment means to be operable, or engages the attachment means so as to attach the ball to the head. The pivoting may be automatic when the ball is engaged by the attachment means, or the attachment means may be operated by forcing the head against the ball and engaging the pivot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example in use a user may push the head against the ball, pivot the head and engage the attachment means, wherein upon release of the pressure the pivot returns and the ball is attached to the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this way the ball may be lifted by the device, and the ball retrieved without the user bending at any point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments the head may be easily retracted towards the blade for retrieval of the attached ball, for example through a mechanism or through gravity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments the collector, or parts thereof, or mechanism for extending the collector, may be stored within or located on the handle. For example in some embodiments the handle may comprise a release mechanism, such as a button to release the collector, head or member, or a spring extending the head, collector or member, wherein the mechanism may comprise a catch mechanism catching against effect of the spring bias.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In some embodiments the mechanism may not comprise a spring bias, but may be arranged to be actuated, and the head extended from the compartment, by the weight or mass of the head. In this way it may be envisaged that the head may extend from the blade under gravity, and/or may retract into the blade through gravity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A sprung catch mechanism may be present for placement and displacement of the head itself within the compartment on the blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mechanism for collector extension may thereby comprise a bipartite or multipartite mechanism, such as a release and a catch, arranged at the handle and blade edge respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the Figures in which:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 8 shows a side view of the collector head for the embodiment shown in Figures 1, displaced for collecting a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Detailed Description of Figures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With reference to the figures there is generally shown a table tennis device 99 comprising a handle 2 and a blade 1, wherein the blade 1 comprises an extendable ball collector 38, the ball collector comprising a head 40, which head is arranged to pivot to engage a ball 60 for collection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In particular reference to the pictured embodiment there is shown an embodiment comprising a coaxially telescopic extendable collector 38 extending from the opposing edge of the frame 4 of the blade 1 from the handle 2, the collector head 40 comprising a part 11 arranged to pivot on a pivot 13.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The device comprises a table tennis bat, which comprises a rigid blade and handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blade 1 is multilayer, comprising two faces 14 with resiliently deformable covering layers, sandwiching an inner body, formed of a wooden perimetric frame 4 with two substantially circular plates facing each other and providing substrate for the covering layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The perimetric frame is discontinuous at the handle 2, which extends outwards from the frame at a bottom end at shoulders 15 and having an enlarged section with padded faces 16.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At the distal point of the frame from the handle the frame is also discontinuous with a displaceable segment providing a lid 8 over an internal compartment 39. As shown in Figure 4 the compartment 39 extends between the faces 14 and into the handle 2, which is otherwise solid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The lid segment comprises the top surface 8 of the collector head 40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The collector comprises the head 40 and an extending part provided by an elongate member 9 extending coaxially telescopically, and formed in a rigid metal, alloy or thermoplastics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The proximal end of the collector’s member is anchored in the handle at a spring 17.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The distal end of the collector’s member is the head 40, which is provided by a collecting basal part 10, which extends axially from the member 9 and comprises the pivot 13 to either side adjacent the member 9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pivot 13 provides attachment for the other part of the collecting head 40, or the catch part 11, which acts to catch the ball. The top surface of this catch part 11 is provided by the lid 8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The catch part 11 describes a circular central lacuna 12 in a flat support, which support extends to either side for support of the lid at its top surface 8, where the bottom surface of this, extending sidewards, provides support for two ferromagnetic portions 18.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use the catch 11 pivots away from coplanar the basal part 10, opening a space between the lacuna 12 and the basal part 10, into which the ball 60 fits to enable it to be grip by the weight of the catch part 11 and enable collecting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The magnetic portions 18 collaborate with ferromagnetic portions in the frame edge of the blade 1, such that the two keep the collector head 40 in a stored position until needed. The user can throw the blade 1 at the floor to break the ferromagnetic bond and release the collector 38 for use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition or the alternative the device comprises a release mechanism 3, which comprises a slide button 7, sliding in a slot 6 in an indentation 5 on one of the handle faces. This mechanism 3 pushes the collector 38 from the compartment 39 when required, or more particularly breaks the ferromagnetic catch and allows the spring 17 to push the collector 18 out from the compartment 39.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The basal part 10 comprises an inclined lower face/end 19, allowing the basal part 10 to be slid under the ball 60 easily, and the catch part 11 pushed away or opened by contact with the top of the ball 60. Alternatively or additionally the catch part 11 may be opened away from the basal part 10 and placed on top ofthe ball 60 so as to grip the ball between the lacuna 12 and the basal part 10 by gravity’s effect on the catch</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention has been described by way of examples only and it will be appreciated that variation may be made to the above-mentioned embodiments without departing from the scope of invention as defined by the claims, in particular but not solely combination of features of described embodiments.</div>
