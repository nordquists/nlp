<div class="abstract">698,088. Table-tennis bats. DUNLOP RUBBER CO., Ltd. June 21, 1951. [July 13, 1950] No. 17509/50. Class 132 (ii). [Also in Group VIII] , A laminated table tennis or like bat, or a material from which one may be cut, is made by inserting wood veneers in a mould in superposed relation with a heat-hardenable adhesive at each interface, applying a vulcanisable rubber composition to each outer face of the assembled wood veneers with a bonding agent between the wood veneers and the rubber composition, and hot-pressing to bond the layers and vulcanise the rubber. When a bat is formed directly from shaped veneer blanks, the mould may have a spew-groove around the periphery of the blade portion of the blanks into which rubber enters to cover the edge of the bat. Shaped wooden blocks may be glued on to form the handle during or after moulding. When making sheet material from which bats are to be cut, rubber may be applied only to those portions of the plywood that are to form playing surfaces. The grain of the veneer may run in different directions in different layers. The heat-hardenable adhesive may be phenol- or ureaaldehyde resin. The bonding agent for the rubber coating may be a heat-hardening aldehyde resin e.g. phenol-aldehyde and an organic polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate which may be employed in a single composition or as two superposed coatings. Specification 679,369, [Group V], is referred to.</div>
