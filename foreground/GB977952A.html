<div class="abstract">977,952. Games. P. A. LATHAM. Feb. 18, 1963, No. 6484/63. Heading A6D. Apparatus for playing a game comprises a structure for location in one corner of a recreation room, and made up of two rigid panels 10, 11 juxtaposed so as to define a comer of less than 90 degrees, and tilted so that their line of intersection 13 forms an acute angle with the playing surface. The structure is used together with a hard rubber ball 56 for propelling against the panels with the aid of bats 57. The bats comprise a sheet of aluminium, plastics or plywood, reinforced with T-shaped handle portions 64 of plywood. Serving lines 17 and 18 are marked on the panels, and plastics tapes backed with pressuresensitive adhesive may be used to mark out a playing area on the floor of the recreation room.</div>
