<div class="description-paragraph" num="0069">
Control of the table tennis competition progress system of the present invention is performed by the table tennis table 10, the rackets 20, 30, 60, 70, the net unit 50, and the respective sensors 21, 31, 41, 42, 43, 44 of the system of the present invention described above. , 51, 61, 71 and by the score calculation terminal 100, the control procedure at the time of a singles competition will be described with reference to FIG.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0070">
First, each sensor of the system of the present invention and the score calculation terminal 100 are initialized S100, and simultaneously with the initialization, the score calculation terminal 100 determines the presence or absence of the first racket sensor 21 and the second racket sensor 31 In step S101, it is determined whether the players play a game with the racket equipped with the sensors 21 and 31.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0071">
As a result of the above determination, control is performed separately in the case where the racquets held by the players are racquets equipped with the sensors 21 and 31 and in the case where the competition is performed with the racquets lacking the sensors 21 and 31.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0072">
That is, when the competition is performed with the racket provided with the sensors 21 and 31, when the competition is started by the first attack service of the player on one side, the score calculation terminal 100 detects an impact detection signal from the net detection sensor 51 of the net unit 50. It is judged whether S is input S102.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0073">
When an impact detection signal is input from the net detection sensor 51, the table tennis ball being serviced is on the net unit 50, so the score calculation terminal 100 waits for the service of one side player to be started again. While monitoring the net unit 50 continuously.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0074">
However, if the impact detection signal is not input from the net detection sensor 51, the table tennis ball being serviced is not placed on the net portion 50 and has been transferred to the other player normally, so the rackets 20 of both players are subsequently continued. , Input patterns of shock detection signals generated by the first sensor 41 and the second sensor 42 of the first area 11 and the second area 12 of the table tennis table 10 are stored in the score calculation terminal 100. It is determined whether a pattern set in advance in the section 170 is input, and it is determined whether a table tennis competition rally is advanced in a normal procedure (S103).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0075">
That is, the shock detection signal by the sensor 21 of the first racket 20 of one player is A, the shock detection signal by the sensor 31 of the second racket 30 of the other player is B, and the player at one side is located Assuming that the shock detection signal by the first sensing sensor 41 of the first area 11 is C, and the shock sensing signal by the second sensor 42 of the second area 12 in which the player on the other side is located is D, Shock detection signal is in the order of A-&gt; C-&gt; D-&gt; B-&gt; C-&gt; A-&gt; D-&gt; B-&gt; C-&gt; A-&gt; D-&gt; B-&gt; C In the score calculation terminal 100, if the input order satisfies the input pattern of the shock detection signal preset in the storage unit 170, the score calculation terminal 100 normally crosses the table tennis ball normally by both players. Judging that it is a rally situation, it will monitor whether the table tennis rally is performed continuously.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0076">
Meanwhile, if the impact detection signal is not input in the normal rally situation, that is, if the impact detection signal is not input in a preset pattern, the player on one side or the player on the other side Is determined to have scored, the score of the player is calculated, and displayed via the display unit 130 (S104).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0077">For example, as described above, the shock detection signal is in the order of A-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt; C. If the shock detection signal B by the second player's racket 30 of the other player is not inputted in the middle, the table tennis ball is not in contact with the second player's second racket 30, and the shock is not received. The score calculation terminal 100 scored such a situation in the score calculation terminal 100 because the detection signal was not generated and the player on the other side could not fight back the table tennis ball hit by the player on one side. The score can be calculated by a method of increasing the score of one player by one point. <br/> Subsequently, if the score of the player on one side or the player on the other side, which the score calculation terminal 100 has increased, is a score (for example, 11 points) satisfying the end score of the set, the set is ended. S106 which notifies via the display part 130, the audio | voice output part 140, or these both 130 and 140 that.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0078">
In the step S105, if the set is not a score that satisfies the end score, does the score calculation terminal 100 generate a difference between the score of one player and the score of the other player based on table tennis rules? If the score difference is generated (for example, 2 points difference), it is necessary to change the service order via the display unit 130 or the voice output unit 140 of the score calculation terminal 100 according to the rule of table tennis. After notifying each player, the process returns to step S108 and the above step S102 to determine the next rally.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0079">
On the other hand, as a result of the determination in step S101, in the case where the racquets held by the players are racquets not provided with the sensors 21 and 31, the following control is performed.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0080">
That is, when the competition is started in the first attack service of the player on one side, the score calculation terminal 100 determines whether or not an impact detection signal is input from the net detection sensor 51 of the net unit 50, S109, the net detection sensor 51. When an impact detection signal is input from the terminal, the score calculation terminal 100 continues monitoring the net unit 50 while waiting for the service of the player on one side to start again as described in the above-mentioned step S102, and the net detection sensor When no shock detection signal is input from the terminal 51, the shock detection signal transmitted from the first sensor 41 in the first area 11 and the second sensor 42 in the second area 12 of the table tennis table 10 is the score calculation terminal 100 It is determined whether it is input in a pattern set in advance in the storage unit 170, and it is determined whether a table tennis rally is normally advanced (S110).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0081">
That is, the shock detection signal by the first sensor 41 in the first area 11 where one player is located is C, and the shock detection signal by the second sensor 42 in the second area 12 where the other player is located is D. Then, if the player on the other side executes the service first, the shock detection signal is scored in order of C-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D If it is input to the calculation terminal 100 and the input order satisfies the pattern set in advance in the storage unit 170, the score calculation terminal 100 is in a rally situation in which both players normally exchange table tennis balls. Judging, it will monitor whether the table tennis rally is performed continuously.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0082">
Meanwhile, if the impact detection signal is not input in the normal rally situation, that is, if the impact detection signal is not input in a preset pattern, one player or the other It is determined that the player has scored, the score of the player is calculated, and displayed via the display unit 130 (S111).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0083">
For example, as described above, while the shock detection signal sequentially enters in the order of C-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D-&gt; C-&gt; D, the second zone of the other player If the sensing signal D of 12 is not inputted, this means that the table tennis ball is not in contact with the second zone 12 of the other player, this means that the table tennis ball hit by the one player is on the other side. Since the player is out of the second zone 12 of the player, the score calculation terminal 100 determines that such a situation has been scored by one side player, and increases the score of the other side player by one point. Can be calculated.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0084">
The steps after step S111 are performed in the same manner as steps S105 to S108 described above, and thus detailed description will be omitted.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0085">
Next, with reference to FIG. 6, the control procedure of the table tennis competition progress system of the present invention at the time of doubles competition will be described.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0086">
First, each sensor of the system of the present invention and the score calculation terminal 100 are initialized S200, and at the same time as the initialization, the score calculation terminal 100 has a competition in the first attack service of the players of the one team When started, the score calculation terminal 100 determines whether an impact detection signal is input from the net detection sensor 51 of the net unit 50 (S201).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0087">
When an impact detection signal is input from the net detection sensor 51, since the table tennis ball being serviced is on the net unit 50, the score calculation terminal 100 waits for the service of one team to be started again. While monitoring the net unit 50 continuously.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0088">
However, if no impact detection signal is input from the net detection sensor 51, this is because the serviced table tennis ball has not been applied to the net portion 50 and has been transferred to the other player normally, so in this case S202 which judges whether the service on a table tennis rule was performed normally.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0089">
That is, since the service by the server must always be performed in the diagonal direction of the server under the rules of the doubles competition, the first sensing sensor 41 of the first area right side 11a and the third sensing sensor of the first area left side 11b 43 and the second detection sensor 42 of the second area right side 12a and the fourth detection sensor 44 of the second area left side 12b, the input time difference of the shock detection signal input to the score calculation terminal 100 and the shock transmitted to each sensor It is possible to determine the hitting position of the service through the amount.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0090">
For example, assuming that the impact detection signal of the first detection sensor 41 of the first area right side portion 11a is C1 and the impact detection signal of the third detection sensor 43 of the first area left side portion 11b is C2, the score calculation terminal of the impact detection signal If the order input to 100 is C1-&gt; C2 order, the first sensing sensor 41 of the first area right side portion 11a first senses the impact accompanying the fall of the table tennis ball, so the position at which the table tennis ball falls is It becomes 1st area | region right side part 11a (that is, the dropping point of a ball becomes the left side).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0091">
Then, if the order input to the score detection terminal 100 of the impact detection signal is C2-&gt; C1 order in reverse, the third sensing sensor 43 of the first area left side portion 11b first detects the impact accompanying the fall of the table tennis ball As a result, the position where the table tennis ball falls is the first area left side portion 11b.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0092">
If the sensor sensing signals of the first sensing sensor 41 and the third sensing sensor 43 are generated at the same time, the table tennis ball is dropped to the middle area between the first area right side 11a and the first area left side 11b. The score can be calculated by a method of reflecting this on the score pros and cons according to the rules of table tennis.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0093">
Furthermore, in addition to the above-described input time difference of impact detection signals, it is possible to determine the hitting position of the service through the amount of impact transmitted to the sensor.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0094">
That is, the shock detection signal of the first sensing sensor 41 of the first area right side portion 11a is C1, the shock detection signal of the third sensing sensor 43 of the first area left side portion 11b is C2, and the signal strength of the shock detection signal is C1. In the case of C2, the falling point of the table tennis ball is closer to the first sensor 41 than the second sensor 43. If the values of C1 and C2 are the same, it can be determined that a drop has occurred at a midpoint between the first area right side portion 11a and the first area left side portion 11b.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0095">
Therefore, the accuracy of the determination can be improved by simultaneously reflecting the shock detection signal and the shock amount information input from each sensor as described above.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0096">
Next, the sensors 21, 31, 61, 71 of the rackets 20, 30, 60, 70 of the players of both teams and the first sensing sensor 41, the second sensing sensor 42, the third sensing sensor 43 of the table tennis table 10 It is determined whether the input pattern of the impact detection signal generated by the fourth detection sensor 44 is input in the storage unit 170 of the score calculation terminal 100 in a preset pattern, and the table tennis competition rally is advanced in a normal procedure. (S203).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0097">
That is, the shock detection signal by the sensor 21 of the first racket 20 of one player of the one team is A, and the shock detection signal by the sensor 61 of the third racket 60 of the other player of the one team is B. The shock detection signal by the sensor 31 of the second racket 30 of one team player is C, and the shock detection signal by the sensor 71 of the fourth racket 70 of the other team player is D. A shock detection signal of the first detection sensor 41 is E, a shock detection signal of the third detection sensor 43 in the first area 11 is F, and a shock detection signal of the second detection sensor 42 in the second area 12 is G. Assuming that the shock detection signal of the fourth sensing sensor 44 in the area 12 is H, if the service is normally performed when the first player of the one team is in charge, the shock detection signal by the rally of both teams is A hitting ball-&gt; G or H-&gt; C hitting-&gt; E or F-&gt; B hitting-&gt; G or H-&gt; D hitting-&gt; E or F-&gt; A hitting-&gt; G or H-&gt; C The hit ball-&gt; E or F-&gt; B hit ball-&gt; G or H-&gt; D hit ball-&gt; E or F is sequentially input to the score calculation terminal 100 in the order of (one side player and the other side team When one player hits as a player), the score calculation terminal 100 is currently a rally where both players normally exchange table tennis balls if their input order satisfies the input pattern of the impact detection signal preset in the storage unit 170. (Rally) Judging that it is a situation, it will monitor whether a table tennis rally is performed continuously.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0098">
Meanwhile, if the impact detection signal is not input in the normal rally situation, that is, if the impact detection signal is not input in a preset pattern, the team on one side or the team on the other side The score of the team is calculated by a method of judging that it has scored, and displayed via the display unit 130 (S204).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0099">
For example, during the shock detection signal input as described above, if the shock detection signal of the first racket 20 or the third racket 30 of the players of the one side team is not input in the middle, this is the first one of the team The table tennis ball is not in contact with the first racket 20 or the third racket 30, so that no shock detection signal is generated, which means that one player could not fight back the table tennis ball hit by the other player Then, the score calculation terminal 100 can calculate the score by a method of judging that such a situation has been scored by the other player and increasing the score of the other player by one point.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0100">
Subsequently, if the score of the one side team or the other side team increased by the score calculation terminal 100 is a score (for example, 11 points) satisfying the end score of the set, S205, that the set has ended S206 notified via the display unit 130, the audio output unit 140, or both of them 130 and 140.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0101">
If the set is not a score that satisfies the end score in the step S205, the score calculation terminal 100 determines whether a difference between the score of one player and the score of the other player has occurred based on the rules of table tennis. Then, if there is a score difference (for example, a two-point difference) in S207, each player must change the service order via the display unit 130 or the voice output unit 140 of the score calculation terminal 100 according to the table tennis rules. After notifying the step S208, the process returns to the step S201 to judge the next rally.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0102">
On the other hand, the score calculation terminal 100 of the present invention executes the following judgment method in preparation for various situations that can occur during table tennis competition, and this is applied immediately when the situation occurs.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0103">1) The score calculation terminal 100 is a filter that analyzes the impact frequency of the input impact detection signal in order to distinguish the impact of table tennis ball and the impact due to other things (for example, the impact of touching the table tennis table with a hand) By providing (not shown), it separates the impact of table tennis balls from the impact of other things. If it is classified as not being a preset impact, even if an impact is input, it can be set to distinguish it and not reflect it in the score calculation. <br/> 2) Recognize that the ping-pong racket strikes the ping-pong table when the ping-pong racket and the ping-pong table shock simultaneously occur during the competition. <br/> 3) When the player puts the serve, the ball does not hit the racket, and if the player hits the table tennis table, it is judged that the player plays the ball on the table tennis table at the preparation stage of the serve. <br/> 4) When the player puts in a serve, the table tennis ball hits the racket, and if the table tennis table is not shocked and hits the racket again, it is recognized that it is an action to play the ball on the floor at the preparation stage of the serve. <br/> Although the table tennis competition progress system of the present invention and the table tennis competition score display method using the same have been described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, various modifications, changes and substitutions may be made by those skilled in the art.
