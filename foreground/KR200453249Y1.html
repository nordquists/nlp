<div class="description-paragraph" num="0019">As shown in the drawings, the table tennis racket rubber cutting device according to the embodiments of the present invention for smoothly and smoothly cutting the rim of the rubber attached to the striking portion of the table tennis racket, the guide member 10, the cutter ( 20), the fixing member 30 and the cap 40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0020">According to an embodiment of the present invention as shown in Figures 1 to 4, the guide member 10 is a guide groove 15 for guiding the movement of the cutter 20 to be described later in the longitudinal direction It is provided long.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0021">However, the guide groove 15 may be made of two or more in order to guide the stable movement of the cutter 20 according to another embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0022">Here, the guide groove 15 of the guide member 10 is made of any one of 凸, □ (not shown) and △ (not shown), but the projection 21 provided in the cutter 20 is fitted and separated It can be in any form as long as it is made of a groove that prevents it from being.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0023">6 and 7, the guide member 10 is made of a flexible material so as to surround him according to the shape of the outside of the table tennis racket 1, that is, a square or a circle. It is possible, but preferably made of a synthetic resin material such as rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0024">Therefore, when the user wants to install the flexible guide member 10 along the outer shape of the table tennis racket 1 to cut off the ridge 3 part of the rubber 2, it is installed in a form surrounding the outer part. It is enough to fix it with the fixing member 30 which will be described next so that he does not depart from the table tennis racket 1 (refer FIG. 6 and FIG. 7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0025">The cutter 20 is coupled to the guide groove 15 of the guide member 10 to be movable in the longitudinal direction, as shown in Figure 7, serves to cut the portion 3 of the rubber (2) It is composed of a body 22, the handle 24 and the blade 26.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0026">The body 22 is detachably coupled to the guide groove 15 through a protrusion 21 provided in a form corresponding to various forms of the guide groove 15 as described above, the guide groove 15, Are combined so as not to break out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0027">The handle 24 is coupled to the upper portion of the body 22 serves to move the body 22 and the blade 26 along the guide groove 15.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0028">That is, the user installs the guide member 10 in the table tennis racket 1 to remove the ridge 3 of the rubber 2 while the cutter 20 is coupled to the guide groove 15, and then the cutter ( Squeeze the handle 24 of 20) by pushing or pulling force to move the blade 26 coupled to the lower portion of the body 22 to cut the rim 3 (see Fig. 7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0029">Therefore, the blade 26 is firmly coupled to the lower portion of the body 22 to move in accordance with the operation of the handle 24 by the user serves to cut the portion 3 of the rubber (2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0030">Here, the blade 26 is shown (not shown), as shown in the drawing, <div class="patent-image"><a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ac/d9/67/6b718330f864b6/112010058099196-utm00002.png"><img alt="Figure 112010058099196-utm00002" class="patent-full-image" file="112010058099196-utm00002.jpg" he="6" height="24" id="i0002" img-format="jpg" src="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ac/d9/67/6b718330f864b6/112010058099196-utm00002.png" wi="5" width="20"/></a></div> (See Fig. 8), ∨ (see Fig. 1 to Fig. 7), ＼ (not shown) and &lt;(not shown) to have a pointed end, a rubber made of a double-sided sponge and rubber ( It is desirable that the part 3 of 2) be cut out smoothly and neatly with little effort by the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0031">The fixing member 30 serves to closely adhere to the guide member 10 surrounding the outer circumference of the table tennis racket 1 as shown in FIG. 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0032">Here, the fixing member 30 is preferably made of a Velcro band as shown in Figures 6 and 7 to facilitate the installation and release of the guide member 10 to the table tennis racket (1). .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0033">Therefore, the user tightly installs the guide member 10 on the outside of the table tennis racket 1, and then firmly fixed through the fixing member 30 and then moving the cutter 20 to the part 3 of the rubber (2) You can just cut it out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0034">Then, when the fixing member 30 is removed and the guide member 10 is released from the table tennis racket 1, as shown in FIG. 9, the table tennis racket 1, in which the rim 3 is smoothly and neatly removed, is shown. Becomes</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0035">On the other hand, in the embodiment according to the present invention, as shown in Figure 4, the cutter 20 is coupled to both ends of the guide member 10 in order to prevent it from being separated after being coupled to the guide groove 15 It is preferable to further provide a cap 40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0036">If the cap 40 is not provided, the guide member 10 is installed on the table tennis racket 1 and the cutter 20 is moved to cut the ridges 3 of the rubber 2 by cutting the cutter 20. If the 20 is out of the guide groove 15 occurs, this may cause damage to the rubber (2) attached to the hitting portion of the racket (1) or to injure the user often occurs. .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0037">Therefore, when both ends of the guide member 10 are blocked using the cap 40, there is no fear that the cutter 20 is separated from the guide groove 15 so that the rubber 2 may be damaged and the user's wound. It will be possible to prevent the occurrence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0038">Looking at the operating state of the table tennis racket (1) rubber (2) cutting device according to the embodiments of the present invention made of a configuration as described above are as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0039">First, the user attaches the rubber 2 to the striking portion of the table tennis racket 1 using a suitable adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0040">Then, the cutter 20 is inserted into the guide groove 15 of the guide member 10, and then the guide member 10 is installed along the outer shape of the table tennis racket 1, and then the fixing member 30 Secure it firmly so that it does not jump through).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0041">At this time, it is also possible to cover the cap 40, which can prevent the separation of the cutter 20 on both ends of the guide groove (15) of the guide member (10).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0042">As described above, when the guide member 10 is installed on the table tennis racket 1, the user may move the cutter 20 to cut the portion 3 of the rubber 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0043">Therefore, by using the cutting device according to an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure 9, the user can manufacture the table tennis racket (1) in which the rim (3) of the rubber (2) smoothly and neatly cut will be.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0044">While the above describes a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the present invention is not limited to the above, it is possible to perform various modifications within the scope of the claims and the detailed description of the invention, this invention also Belongs to the scope of. <br/> </div>
