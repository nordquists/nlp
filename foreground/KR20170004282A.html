<tech-problem>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0005">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a racket having a shake hand type racket in which the index finger is hermetically supported on the rear portion of the racquet body and the grip portion is gripped by a thumb, The present invention provides a shake hand type table tennis racket having a water support for supporting a hand sword of a player's hand and preventing a hand from being separated from the grip.</div>
</tech-problem>
<tech-solution>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a shake hand type table tennis racket comprising a racket body; Two hit portions on both sides of the racket body with rubber attached thereto; A grip portion extending to a lower side of the racquet body; And a water support portion formed at an end of the grip portion to support a user's hand when gripping the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0007">Here, the water support portion may be formed on at least one of the four sides of the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0008">In addition, the water supply support portion may be formed to protrude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0009">The grip portion may further include a projection formed on an outer surface of the grip portion so that a user's finger is held while being gripped by the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0010">In order to prevent the racket from shaking when the grip portion is gripped, the lower end of the hit portion may be in close contact with the grip between the thumb and the index finger, thereby preventing the racket from swinging.</div>
</tech-solution>
<advantageous-effects>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0011">According to the present invention, since the index finger is closely attached to the rear part of the racquet body and the grip part of the shake hand type racket is gripped by the thumb, stop, finger and little finger separately, It is expected to improve the aggressiveness due to the hit of the table tennis ball by preventing the hand from being detached from the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0012">In addition, due to the water support portion, the gripping force of the racket can be minimized even in the case of a strong hit, thereby preventing shaking at the time of hit and securing accurate and strong attack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0013">Also, since the thumb, the stop finger, the thumb and forefinger are easily gripped by the protrusion on the outer surface of the grip portion, the slip of the user's finger and the grip portion is prevented, and the slip is prevented, Not only can a table tennis game be enjoyed using both sides of the ball, but also the aggressiveness due to the hit of the table tennis ball is improved by reducing the slip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0014">In addition, since the lower end portion of the hit portion is in close contact with the grip between the thumb and the index finger to prevent the racket from shaking, the anti-shake portion is formed at the close contact portion of the lower end portion of the hit portion, Beginners as well as skilled people can easily switch to a straight line and can play a more stable and stable batting.</div>
