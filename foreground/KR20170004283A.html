<tech-problem>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve at least the above-mentioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a grip portion in which two or more front or side axes of a grip portion are provided, thereby forming a void space between a hand and a grip portion, The present invention provides a shake hand type table tennis racket.</div>
</tech-problem>
<tech-solution>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a shake hand type table tennis racket comprising: a racket body; Two hit portions on both sides of the racket body with rubber attached thereto; And a grip portion extending to a lower side of the racquet body, wherein at least two front axes or side axes of the grip portion are present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0007">The apparatus may further include a water support portion formed at an end of the grip portion to support a user's hand when gripping the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0008">The grip portion may further include a projection formed on an outer surface of the grip portion so that a user's finger is held while being gripped by the grip portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0009">In order to prevent the racket from shaking when the grip portion is gripped, the lower end of the hit portion may be in close contact with the grip between the thumb and the index finger, thereby preventing the racket from swinging.</div>
</tech-solution>
<advantageous-effects>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0010">According to the present invention, since there are two or more front axes or side axes of the grip portion, an empty space is formed between the palm and the grip due to the two side axes of the grip portion when the grip portion is gripped by the hand, The sweat generated in the adjacent palm can be easily evaporated due to the wind which flows through the formed space and the slip is minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0011">In addition, since the index finger is closely attached to the rear portion of the racket body and the grip portion of the shake hand type racket is gripped with the thumb, the stop, the finger, and the little finger separately, Thereby preventing the hands from being disengaged from the grip portion, thereby improving the aggressiveness due to the hit of the table tennis ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0012">Further, since protrusions are formed on the outer surface of the grip portion for gripping the racquet body to support the fingers, both of the both surfaces are used. Thus, the frictional action of the protrusions facilitates switching between the backhand and the forehand So that even beginners can easily enjoy the table tennis game using the double-sided method of the shake hand type racket, and the aggressiveness due to the hit of the table tennis ball is improved by reducing the shaking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0013">In addition, since the lower end portion of the hit portion is in close contact with the grip between the thumb and the index finger to prevent the racket from shaking, the anti-shake portion is formed at the close contact portion of the lower end portion of the hit portion, Beginners as well as skilled people can easily switch to a straight line and can play a more stable and stable batting.</div>
