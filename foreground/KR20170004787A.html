<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA205480963" source="national office">
<div class="abstract">The present invention relates to a racket including a body and a grip formed thereon to be extended from the body, wherein the grip is coupled with a plurality of blocks. According to the present invention, a grip can be freely produced by being customized to individuals according to the size or the shape of the hand of a user, so the grip can be strongly gripped and a maximum effect can be shown. Moreover, the grips pieces blocked in various sizes and shapes are connected to miss each other a little bit, so a space capable of ensuring air permeability in the grip is produced. When the grip is gripped by a hand, the palm of the hand is prevented from being completely placed on the grip, so a phenomenon in which a skid occurs due to sweating caused by close placement of the hand is minimized. Accordingly, when hitting a ball, the racket can have a maximum effect with respect to offense and defense. Moreover, block concave and convex parts formed in a gap between blocks and on the surfaces of the blocks can be formed corresponding to the shape of a hand of a user, and sweat generated from his/her hand can flow and be discharged through the block concave and convex parts. Moreover, when the grip is produced by using blocks having various colors and shapes, the grip can be provided as a unique aesthetic grip capable of having various designs to meet demands of each of users, and the edges or block concave and convex parts of the blocks come in contact with a hand through block intervals, so a skid is minimized and gripping power is improved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a racket, and more particularly to a racket capable of hitting a ball or a shuttlecock such as a table tennis ball, a badminton ball, a tennis ball,</div>
</technical-field>
<background-art>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0002">For example, in the case of a table tennis racket used for table tennis, the racket has a narrow swing width due to the characteristics of a narrow table tennis die, so that the resistance of the air is not greatly affected, and the length of the grip is also short In badminton racquets used in badminton sports, a plurality of rows are woven in a lattice form to minimize the resistance of the air, and the length of the grip portion is also long, so that the badminton ball at a distance can be hit without difficulty .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0003">Meanwhile, conventional racquets have many problems in that only a uniformly manufactured product is sold according to a predetermined standard without considering the size or shape of the hand of individual users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0004">In addition, in the conventional racquet, when gripping the grip with the hand, the grip and the close contact portion of the palm have a uniform shape, the same grip is uniformly provided to most people so that there is no way to realize the difference in the structure of the individual palm and the difference in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0005">Further, due to the form of close contact, it is inevitable to use it while taking the inconvenience of slipping and the like.</div>

<summary-of-invention>
<tech-problem>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a racket capable of freely and customizing the grip according to the size and shape of a user's hand.</div>
</tech-problem>
<tech-solution>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a racquet comprising a body and a grip extending from the body, wherein the grip is formed by combining a plurality of blocks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0008">Here, grooves may be formed at one side of each of the blocks, and protrusions may be formed at the other side of the blocks, so that the blocks may be coupled by inserting protrusions into the grooves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0009">In addition, a through hole is formed in each of the blocks, and the connecting blocks can be coupled by inserting a connecting rod into the through hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0010">Further, the blocks may be bonded and bonded by an adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0011">Further, the blocks may be joined by fastening them with nails such as screws in the state where the blocks are adjacent to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0012">In addition, the blocks may be formed with various irregularities on the surface.</div>
</tech-solution>
<advantageous-effects>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0013">According to the present invention, it is possible to freely manufacture the grips in a customized manner according to the size and shape of the user, so that the maximum effect of gripping the grips can be exerted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0014">In addition, by connecting the blocks of the blocks blocked in various sizes and shapes in a staggered manner, it is possible to provide a space for securing the breathability in the grips, thereby preventing the palm from completely coming into close contact with the grips when gripping the grips by hand, By minimizing the slipping phenomenon, it is possible to exert the maximum effect in the ball airing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0015">Also, when connecting the block, it can be used in various forms according to the characteristics of the user and the size of the hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0016">The gap between the blocks and the block irregularities formed on the four sides of the block can be configured according to the shape of each hand of the user and the sweat generated from the hand flows through the gaps between the blocks and the block irregularities formed on the four sides of the block. .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0017">In addition, it is possible to provide a unique aesthetic grip with various designs to each user when manufacturing grips using blocks of various colors and shapes, and also has an advantage that the edges of the blocks or the block irregularities come into contact with the hand There is an effect that the slip is minimized and the gripping force is increased.</div>
