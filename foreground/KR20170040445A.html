<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="google" mxw-id="PA307100384" source="translation">
<div class="abstract" num="0001a">The present invention relates to an elliptical frame, a string provided at a predetermined distance from the inner circumferential surface of the frame, a net in which the string is crossed, a bag extending from one side of the frame, and a grip extending along the length of the bag, And a weight attached to the other end frame head portion of the frame. In the swinging type power swing racket of the present invention, when the racket meets the ball while rotating around the elbow and the wrist, the end of the racket frame is faster than the center of the frame. In other words, since the relative speed varies depending on the position where the frame meets the ball, a weight is inserted into the head portion that gives the maximum speed in the racket by centrifugal force, thereby maximizing the swing power. Also, since only the frame head of the racket is heavy, the overall weight is relatively light, so it can be used for beginners and for ladies.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0002">Many people use tennis, baseball, golf, and other spats using racquets. While enhancing the design of the racquet, it enhances the function and reduces the weight, while using materials that enhance the rigidity and toughness of the durability, or the vibration of each racket is minimized and the ball is easily controlled. .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0003">Generally, a racket includes a head, a shaft, a neck for connecting the head and the shaft, and a grip for wrapping the cloth or leather so that the racket held by the hand does not slip, (Net), which is a part where the ball is impacted, and a head frame, which has a hollow frame structure and strings are struck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0004">The swing speed of this racket comes from the snap of the wrist which instantly controls the racket, and the racket consisting of a soft, thin shaft and slim head frame is generally used Is preferred. However, while the slender flexible shaft and head frame racket have the advantages of good elasticity, quick operation and control of subtle racket movement, the shock absorbing ability of the racket is weakened, and when the shuttlecock impact, There is a disadvantage that the racket can rotate in the direction of this impact. Therefore, in the case of a slim racket, there is a problem that when the shuttlecock is attempted to be hit by a quick swing such as a smash or a drive, the stability of the shuttle is deteriorated and the accurate control becomes rather difficult or power is not turned on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0005">In addition, it is possible to increase the power when using a racket made of a head heavy type or a rigid shaft, and to improve the stability at the time of impact of a shuttlecock. However, in order to cope with a rapid airflow, The instability due to the impact of the racket or the impact on the racket is a common problem that must be solved likewise.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0016">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in order to facilitate a person skilled in the art to easily carry out the technical idea of the present invention. . In the drawings, the same reference numerals are used to designate the same or similar components throughout the drawings. In the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0017">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0018">In general, the common features of racket (10), such as tennis, baseball, golf, badminton, etc., are similar in swing structure. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to racket 10 of a specific item.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0019">Racquets are lighter in weight due to the diversity of materials and design innovations compared to the past, and have a smaller swing weight, allowing users to operate faster. On the other hand, since the effective mass of the racquet is reduced during operation at the same speed, the velocity of the ball against the light racket is reduced. Therefore, the speed of waving the racquet 10 must be greater than the negative effect of the lighter 10 being lighter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0020">FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an attacking type power swing racket according to the present invention. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an attack type power swing racket according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, A frame part 300 extending from one side of the frame 100 and a grip 400 extending along the length direction of the frame part 300.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0021">In the past, most of the frame 100 was made of wood, but recently, materials such as aluminum, carbon, graphite, and titanium have been used in combination, and their types and characteristics have been diversified. Aluminum is very easy to buy, so it is used in low cost racquets. It is strong but it has no elasticity. Rackets made of carbon are strong and resilient. Graphite is a material made by processing carbon and is more durable and resilient. Finally, since titanium is expensive material, it is used in a way that the surface of the racket is covered with mesh to increase the elasticity which is a disadvantage of graphite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0022">In the present invention, a carbon graphite material is used, which is a material made by processing carbon as described above, and is used for almost all the racquets 10 at present. It is lightweight and has a strong elasticity. It has the advantage of realizing various weights and producing torque and strength. In addition, the fatigue strength is much higher than that of steel, and the strength is maintained uniform even after continuous use. In addition, aluminum, titanium or other materials can be applied depending on the desired function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0023">2 is a view showing an embodiment in which a weight 500 is formed on an attack type power swing racket frame head 110 according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0024">Prior to the molding operation of the racquet 10, a weight 500 of a stainless steel material, which is a metal material having a large specific gravity, is superimposed on the graphite, which is a main material of the racquet, 110) and then rolled round to proceed molding. At this time, the weight 500 can be freely adjusted in weight and length according to the demand and performance of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0025">Figure 3 is an embodiment of an offensive power swing racket of the present invention. When the user holds the grip 400 and swings, the weight acceleration due to the metal plate 500 having a large specific gravity located at the outermost head portion 110 of the racket 10 with the maximum centrifugal force, Speed and power. As shown in FIG. 3, when the racket 10 advances and swings in the direction of the arrow, weight acceleration is added to the outermost portion of the racket 10 where the center of gravity is located, such as a change in the size of the arrow, .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0026">In other words, the maximum swing speed of the racket 10 is determined by the swing weight (SW) of the racket 10. In terms of physics, it corresponds to the moment of inertia. In the manufacturer of the racquet 10, usually, a point within about 10 cm from the grip 400 of the racquet, that is, the rotation of the racquet Indicates inertia. At this time, the swing is slightly different depending on the person, and is a complicated rotation form about the shoulder joint, elbow, and wrist. Therefore, it is concluded that the maximum swing speed of racquets (10) with the same swing weight (SW) are similar to each other. That is, there is not a large correlation between the weight difference of the racket 10 and the swing speed. On the other hand, the maximum swing speed of the racket (10), which is the same weight as the racket (10) but has different swing weight, greatly changed according to the swing weight (SW). In other words, the maximum swing speed of the racquet 10 depends on the swing weight SW, not on the weight of the racquet 10. The relationship between the maximum linear velocity V <sub>max</sub> of the racket head and the swing weight (SW) according to the experiment is as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0027">V <sub>max</sub> = C / I <sup>n</sup> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0028">Here C is a constant and the value is different for each person. I stands for the swing weight, and for most racquets sold commercially, n is about 0.27.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0029">The swing weight SW is important when the racket 10 is selected. The swing weight SW is determined by the size of the head 110, the thickness of the racket, the total weight and the balance. It can be divided into three. First, a racket 10 whose weight is light (300 g or less) and whose balance is a heavy weight of the head 110 and whose swing weight (SW) is heavier than the total weight is referred to herein as a beginner, an elderly, Belongs. This racket (10) is easy to swing because of its light weight, and its swing weight (SW) Secondly, the racket 10 is of medium weight (300-325 g) and balanced head 11 light, while the swing weight (SW) is equal to or heavier than the total weight. This is about a tweener racket (10) that is easy to serve and can hit a ball with some power, and control control is good at the same time. Finally, the overall weight is heavy (330 g), the balance is the head 11 light, and the swing weight SW is lighter than the total weight. This is for the player (player), the power is not good but the control is very good.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0030">As described above, an optimal embodiment has been disclosed in the drawings and specification. Although specific terms have been employed herein, they are used for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims or the claims. Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and equivalent embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the true scope of the present invention should be determined by the technical idea of the appended claims.</div>
