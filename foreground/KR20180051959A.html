<div class="description-paragraph" num="0002">Generally, when a tool having a body and a handle is used, there is a problem that the thumb must be tightly held in order to use it strongly or safely. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, when using a table tennis athletic tool which is to be strongly held without shaking, it is necessary to bend the thumb firmly to hold the racket handle so that force is applied to the hands and arms when the ball is hit, It is difficult to cope and there is a problem in making a strong attack. As another example, as shown in FIG. 4, when a conventional kitchen knife is used, the knife of the knife is hardly gripped and used to control slipping and shaking. Small protuberances and irregularities are formed, but this does not prevent the hand from slipping safely. Instead, it only grips the surface by using friction force only to prevent slipping. When a mistake occurs momentarily due to the large force applied, There is a danger that the knife slips instantly, causing a serious injury.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0013">For example, when at least one of the fingers is brought into close contact with the fingertip blocking portion when the handle of the kitchen knife is gripped and the other portion is brought into close contact with the tool front blocking portion and is brought into close contact with the side blocking portion, the hand slides forward The knife is prevented from being hurt by touching the sharp part of the knife so as to move the knife up and down so that the knife can be gripped firmly and firmly while the knife is in use so that the dangerous knife can be used safely and comfortably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0014">In another example, at least one of the fingers is brought into close contact with the fingertip separation blocking portion when the handle of the water-saving pot for kitchen is gripped, and is brought into close contact with the tool front separation blocking portion and closely contacted with the tool left and right separation blocking portion. So that it is possible to grasp a sturdy handle without slipping and shaking, so that it is possible to grasp the water-saving pot comfortably and use it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0015">In addition, when the handle of the water-saving pot for kitchen is gripped, another finger is brought into close contact with the fingertip blocking portion, and the finger is held in close contact with the tool forward blocking portion, Is securely grasped, and it is possible to grasp a stable grip without slipping and shaking, so that it is possible to grasp the number pot easily and comfortably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0016">For example, in the case of carrying the umbrella, it is also possible to grasp the handle. For example, at least one finger of the five fingers may be inserted between the finger forward release blocking portion and the tool forward release blocking portion and the middle portion of the tool left and right release blocking portion And on the opposite side, the upper and lower grips of the tool are provided, and when the grip is interposed between the stop and the finger grip, it is possible to grasp the grip firmly without swinging, so that it is not easy to grip the umbrella and the umbrella is shaken or slipped There is an effect that the handle can be held and used comfortably and stably. In this case, when at least one finger is used, there is an effect that stable and stable gripping can be performed. If the tip of two or more fingers of the five fingers is closely attached between the fingertip blocking part and the tool front blocking part and the tool left and right blocking part, the umbrella is not strong enough to hold the umbrella There is no shaking or slipping out so that the grip can be held comfortably and stably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0017">In another embodiment, when the handle is gripped, at least one of the fingers of the finger is held in close contact with the finger forward blocking portion, the tool forward blocking portion, and the tool lateral blocking portion, It is possible to grip the grip by gripping it, and it can be used comfortably and without difficulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0018">In another example, when gripping a handle of a shake hand type racket, the thumb is brought into close contact with the finger forward departure prevention portion, the tool forward departure prevention portion and the tool left and right departure prevention portion, and further, the stop, It is possible to grasp the fingers with the forward detachment blocking part and the tool forward detent blocking part and the tool lateral detachment blocking part, so that it is possible to grasp the robust grip without shaking. Therefore, when the thumb is bent, tension of the tendon and force for pulling the muscles are eliminated. As the handle does not come out, it is expected to improve the aggressiveness by enabling a strong hit of the table tennis ball.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="0023">In order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention, in the handle 120 having the finger forward baffling part 130 according to the present invention, the body 110 is a part where the tool 100 functions, and the handle 120 Refers to the portion of the user gripping the tool 100 to use the tool 100. The handle 120 may be convexly protruded or recessed in the body or may be provided with a handle 120 ) Means a tool formed integrally with the body to perform two functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0024">The handle 120 is the same as a term called a grip or a sack and the handle 120 is provided with a tool 100 Quot; hand-held portion &amp;quot;).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0025">When using a tool with a handle, the user holds the handle of the tool by hand. In this case, the tool must be stable without shaking to obtain the purpose of use of the tool. In use, the tool can be moved in six directions: precisely, front, back, left, right, top and bottom in the human hand. The direction of this movement is the same for any object in the three-dimensional real world. In this principle, when a person grasps a tool and moves it in six directions rather than the purpose of using the tool, it can not achieve the purpose of using the tool satisfactorily. Even if you get it, you have to hold the tool handle very tightly to prevent it from slipping, shaking or moving. This results in a lot of empowerment and even mental tension, burdens and accidents. It is an object of the present invention to provide a handle that is convenient to achieve the purpose of use of the tool while minimizing the problems in using the tool and consuming less power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0026">In addition, according to the present invention, since the direction of movement of the tool is different according to the purpose and method of use of the tool, the finger forward departure prevention part and the tool forward departure prevention part play an important role only for the push- It is more useful that the left and right side release baffle portions of the tool and the tool up and down baffle portions are additionally provided. When a tool is used to slip out of the tool, it means that the tool is pulled out due to centrifugal force or force, which is the same as when the user pulls the tool but does not pull the tool. In addition, when the tool is used, the hand slides forward because the tool is stopped by the resistance in use, and the user is forced to move the tool in the forward direction, and the resistance of the tool is too high to push the tool, These are forces acting in the opposite direction that appear in opposite phenomena. Also, when the tool is moved, it moves forward and causes it to wobble sideways. That is, it receives a force to sideways departure. This lateral force is the direction perpendicular to the front of the handle of the tool. We talked about the forces in two perpendicular directions, and the other direction is the direction that is exerted purely by the influence of gravity. In other words, the tool moves forward and wiggles up and down at the same time. The forces of these three directions are perpendicular to each other and have three-dimensional directions. It also always occurs and interacts with the use of the tool, affecting the use of the tool. According to the present invention, it is possible to prevent and minimize the forces that are unnecessary and unintentional to these three directions of force, that is, the forces moving back and forth, the forces moving left and right and the forces moving up and down, The force generated in the forward and backward directions is provided to the finger forward departure prevention portion 130 and the tool forward departure prevention portion 140 to block the force of the three directions so that the best effect is attained for the purpose, And the upper and lower portions of the tool are provided with a tool up-and-down movement blocking portion 160 to prevent the upper and lower portions. At this time, when the tool up-and-down movement blocking part 160 is provided in the opposite direction of the surface on which the finger forward departure prevention part 130 is attached, it is possible to effectively prevent the shaking. In addition, when the thumb is brought into close contact with the fingertip departure blocking portion 130, the detection or stopping of the thumb or the stop or the finger or the like comes into close contact with the tool holding portion 160 to effectively prevent the shaking, The thumb or the thumb is brought into close contact with the tool up-and-down movement restricting portion 160 to effectively prevent the shaking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0027">In addition, the tool forward deviation phenomenon occurs when the tool moves forward due to the centrifugal force or the movement force of the tool itself, or when the gripping hand appears to be unable to support the handle by holding the handle or the hand holding the tool And the handle is slipping due to the resistance of the tool. Finger forward deviation occurs when the tool is held in place by the hand and the tool is in place while the hand is moving forward or the hand is kept still. When the tool is moved toward the user's body by external or self- This is a phenomenon in which the knob is slipped or pushed out without supporting it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0028">When gripping the handle according to the present invention at the same time as grasping the tool forward departure prevention portion 140 formed in the direction opposite to the finger forward departure prevention portion 130, the grip is gripped more strongly and comfortably. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the two forces are paired and force in opposite directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0029">According to the present invention, the finger forward departure prevention portion 130 and the tool forward departure prevention portion 140 serve to prevent forces acting in opposite directions to each other, thereby gripping the tool more safely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0030">According to the present invention, when the tool left and right side release baffle parts 150 and the tool up and down movement preventing part 160 are additionally provided, it is possible to grasp the handle more securely in three dimensions. The tool up-and-down movement blocking unit 160 may be provided on the opposite side of the thumb releasing blocking unit 130 to which the thumb is closely attached, and may be provided with one or a plurality of finger insertion / So that the grip 120 can be prevented from swinging up and down, and the grip 120 can be stably gripped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0031">The handle 120 according to the present invention is provided with a finger forward departure prevention portion 130 for preventing the user's hand from slipping forward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0032">In addition, the handle 120 according to the present invention has a resistance or a frictional force when the user moves the tool in close contact with the floor or other object when the user uses the tool. In order to overcome this, The user's hand is slid forward from the tool handle when the pushing force is stronger than the pushing force of the tool knob. The slip is prevented by the finger forward blocking stopper 130, When the tool is shaken in the air or when it comes in contact with the floor or other objects, the momentarily falls, the centrifugal force or the locomotive force is generated forward in the movement of the tool, and the grip slides forward. At this time, 140 to prevent the tool from escaping. It is a technical point to reduce the burden of having to apply force to the hand, and to be able to grasp the handle of the tool safely and comfortably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0033">In addition, the handle 120 according to the present invention is configured such that the finger forward departure prevention portion 130 or the tool forward departure prevention portion 140, which prevents the user's hand from slipping forward, It is possible to prevent the finger from being pushed in close contact with the front surface and the side surface of the finger, thereby stably gripping the grip 120 without shaking the grip as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0034">Further, the handle 120 according to the present invention means that the fingers can use not only the front portion of the finger but also the entire finger or the entire hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="0035">In addition, according to the present invention, the handle of the tool differs in the direction of movement of the tool according to the purpose and method of use, so that it is suitable for the finger forward departure prevention part 130 or the tool forward departure prevention part 140) It is preferable to select the side departure blocking portion 150 or the tool up and down movement blocking portion 160 if they are all necessary tools or if only a part thereof is sufficient for the purpose of using sufficient tools for comfort and comfort.
