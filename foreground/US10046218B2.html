<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/493,703, filed Jul. 14, 2016, entitled “A Table Tennis Racket Which Imparts Ultra High Spin”.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to table tennis equipment, and specifically to a non-planar table tennis racket configured to impart ultrahigh spin on a ball.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Table tennis is a sport that when played competitively, relies on the use of ball spin to enable players to hit with a very fast pace while ensuring that the ball will bounce off the surface of the table on the opponent's end. When a player hits the ball with topspin, aerodynamic forces create a downward force on the ball, causing the ball to drop towards the table. The greater the spin, the greater the downward force imposed on the ball. As a result, a player who creates a greater amount of topspin can hit the ball with more force as compared to a player who creates less topspin because the greater topspin will create greater downward force on the ball, thereby reducing the chance that the ball will travel beyond the end of the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional table tennis rackets are naturally balanced because the mass of the racket is symmetrically distributed around a longitudinal axis extending through the handle and the racket blade. By utilizing rackets that are symmetrical and balanced, players can easily control the racket and corresponding racket stroke, while utilizing either side of the racket blade to strike the ball during forehand and backhand strokes. However, the uniformly symmetrical, balanced design of conventional table tennis rackets places an artificial ceiling on the amount of spin that a player can generate on the ball because of the limitations of the common racket design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">It is with respect to these considerations and others that the disclosure made herein is presented.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It should be appreciated that this Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Concepts and technologies described herein provide for a non-planar table tennis racket. According to one aspect, a non-planar table tennis racket includes a racket blade and a racket handle. The racket blade is positioned in a blade plane and has two opposing faces for striking a table tennis ball. The racket handle has a linear configuration with a longitudinal axis extending from a base end to a blade connection end of the racket handle. The blade connection end of the racket handle is connected to the racket blade in a non-planar configuration so that the longitudinal axis is offset from the blade plane according to an offset angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to yet another aspect, a non-planar table tennis racket has an asymmetrical racket body. The asymmetrical racket body includes a racket blade and a racket handle. The racket blade has two opposing faces positioned in a blade plane. The racket handle has a linear configuration with a longitudinal axis extending from a base end of the racket handle to a blade connection end of the racket handle. The racket handle is connected to the racket blade in a non-planar configuration with the longitudinal axis positioned at an offset angle to the blade plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect, a non-planar table tennis racket includes a racket handle connected to a racket blade at an offset angle. The center of gravity of the non-planar table tennis racket is offset from a longitudinal axis, creating a racket body that is unbalanced and asymmetrical.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The following detailed description is directed to a non-planar table tennis racket that is capable of imparting ultrahigh spin to a table tennis ball. For the purposes of this discussion, “ultrahigh” may be understood as including spin greater than 150 revolutions per second. Table tennis balls typically spin at less than 150 revolutions per second during competitive play using traditional planar or symmetrical table tennis rackets. Because the rotational velocity depends not only on the equipment being used, but also on the technique and skill of the player, the 150 revolutions per second value used herein should not be considered limiting. Rather, the non-planar table tennis racket of the various embodiments described herein should be understood to be capable of providing significantly more ball rotation than conventional table tennis rackets because of the angled, non-planar design shown and described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As discussed above, a conventional table tennis racket is symmetrical around a longitudinal axis extending through the handle and center of the racket blade. The resulting racket is balanced and easy to control, allowing the player to use the front and rear surfaces of the racket head (or “blade”) to strike the ball during forehand and backhand strokes. However, the amount of spin that is placed on the table tennis ball with a traditional balanced and symmetrical racket isn't optimal since the center of the racket blade (the “sweet spot” for ball contact) is positioned on the longitudinal axis extending through the handle. Rotation of the racket blade around the longitudinal axis, by itself, imparts very little spin to the ball if the ball is contacted in the center of the blade. The conventional racket requires the player to generate spin using the angle of the blade with respect to the table when the ball is struck, the upward or downward motion (coupled with the forward motion) of the racket when the ball is struck, and the force at which the ball is struck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">However, utilizing the concepts and technologies described herein, a non-planar table tennis racket is provided to increase the spin imparted on a table tennis ball. Table tennis rules are very liberal with respect to the table tennis racket. The rules state explicitly that a racket may be of any size, shape, or weight. The various embodiments discussed herein provide a non-planar table tennis racket that is unbalanced and asymmetrical, which is a substantial departure from the configuration of a conventional planar table tennis racket. The benefits of this non-planar configuration are significant and will become clear in the discussion below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and which are shown by way of illustration, specific embodiments, or examples. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements through the several figures, a non-planar table tennis racket according to the various embodiments will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> show top perspective, bottom perspective, side, top, and front views, accordingly, of a non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> according to various embodiments described herein. Looking at these figures together, the table tennis racket <b>100</b> includes a racket blade <b>102</b> connected to a racket handle <b>104</b>, which together form the racket body <b>106</b>. The racket handle <b>104</b> includes a base end <b>112</b> and a blade connection end <b>114</b>. The blade connection end <b>114</b> connects the racket handle <b>104</b> to the racket blade <b>102</b>. The racket blade <b>102</b> includes a first face <b>108</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>) and a second face <b>110</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>) opposite the first face. The first face <b>108</b> and the second face <b>110</b> are both configured to strike a table tennis ball, which includes being exposed and being made from, or covered with, any suitable material conventionally used for table tennis rackets. The second face <b>110</b> may be covered with a second material having a second color (i.e., red) that distinguishes the second face <b>110</b> from a first material of a first color (i.e., black) of the first face <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to various embodiments, due to the angled configuration of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b>, a player would utilize the second face <b>110</b> to strike a table tennis ball almost exclusively, meaning during a majority of both forehand and backhand strokes. Because of the non-planar configuration, transitioning between forehand and backhand strokes includes the player rotating the wrist and hand holding the racket handle <b>104</b> without having to adjust the player's grip on the handle. As a result, the transition time between a forehand and backhand stroke is significantly shortened as compared to traditional table tennis rackets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Looking at <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, further details regarding the unbalanced, asymmetrical configuration of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> will be discussed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a side view of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> as the racket blade <b>102</b> is resting on a surface <b>310</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle <b>104</b> is shown extending centrally through the racket handle <b>104</b>. Similarly, the racket blade <b>104</b> is positioned within a blade plane <b>312</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle <b>104</b> is disposed at an offset angle <b>304</b> to the blade plane <b>312</b> to create the non-planar configuration. In various embodiments, the offset angle <b>304</b> may be between 10-45 degrees. In preferred embodiments, the offset angle <b>304</b> may be between 15-40 degrees. In some preferred embodiments, the offset angle <b>304</b> may be between 15-35 degrees. In other preferred embodiments, the offset angle may be between 20-35 degrees for optimizing the spin imparted on a table tennis ball. According to one illustrative embodiment, the offset angle <b>304</b> is approximately 30 degrees. In a second illustrative example, the offset angle is approximately 25 degrees. It should be understood by those of skill in the table tennis arts that an offset angle of between 25-30 degrees places the racket blade at the optimal ready position for most players.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Because the mass of the racket handle <b>104</b> is centered on the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle <b>104</b> and the mass of the racket blade <b>102</b> is centered on the blade plane <b>312</b>, the center of gravity <b>306</b> is located offset from both the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle and the blade plane <b>312</b>. The positioning of the center of gravity <b>306</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is not limited to the precise position shown. Rather, the center of gravity <b>306</b> is marked in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to illustrate that the center of gravity <b>306</b> is not collinear with the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>, as is the situation with conventional balanced table tennis rackets. Because the center of gravity <b>306</b> is not collinear with the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>, the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> is considered unbalanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">All conventional planar table tennis rackets are naturally balanced because the mass of the racket is symmetrically distributed around the longitudinal axis of the racket. In contrast, the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> described according to the various embodiments herein is naturally unbalanced because of the asymmetrical distribution of the mass of the racket. With typical racket sports, an unbalanced racket is undesirable because of the difficulty in controlling the racket head due to the moment or torque induced by the center of gravity being offset from the axis through the racket handle. However, the unbalanced nature of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> is not detrimental in the table tennis context since the weight and amount of unbalance is within acceptable limits for providing accurate control for most table tennis players. Rather, because the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> is unbalanced, it is lighter than balanced angle rackets in the prior art. Additionally, the non-planar, unbalanced table tennis racket <b>100</b> also allows the player to utilize the same side of the racket blade for both forehand and backhand strokes by merely rotating the player's hand and wrist. This reduces the reaction time necessary to reposition the table tennis racket from a forehand to a backhand position and vis-à-vis since the player does not need to rotate the racket handle to move between the first side of the racket blade to the second side of the racket blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The asymmetrical, unbalanced design of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> described herein creates significantly more spin on a table tennis ball than conventional planar designs for several reasons. First, the contact location on the racket blade <b>102</b> where the second face <b>110</b> contacts the table tennis ball is offset from the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle <b>104</b> rather than aligned with the axis. Because the contact location is offset, rotation of the racket handle <b>104</b> by the player creates a radial movement and corresponding angular momentum associated with the racket blade <b>102</b> at the contact location as the racket blade <b>102</b> rotates around the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle. This angular momentum from the wrist and hand rotation of the player, coupled with the conventional arm motion during the stroke of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b>, imparts ultrahigh spin as the racket blade <b>102</b> contacts and repels the table tennis ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the offset angle <b>304</b> of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> allows a player to hit the table tennis ball in a more forward position as compared to a traditional planar table tennis racket. Doing so not only assists the player in keeping an eye on the ball during contact to better control the ball, but also allows for more forward movement of the racket prior to contact. This increased forward movement allows for an increased racket head speed at the point of contact with the table tennis ball, which translates into more spin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Non-planar racket configurations have been utilized in the past in the context of tennis rackets. U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,550 to Planakis (hereinafter described as the '550 patent) discloses an offset tennis racket that increases spin placed on a tennis ball. The discussion in the '550 patent corresponding to the manner in which the '550 racket increases spin placed on a tennis ball applies to the manner in which the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> described herein increases spin imparted to a table tennis ball. However, the configuration of the '550 tennis racket is substantially different than the configuration of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b>. The '550 racket is a balanced racket. The center of gravity is positioned along the axis running through the hand grip portion. As explicitly stated in the '550 patent, the center of gravity must be along the hand grip axis. To accomplish the critical placement of the center of gravity along the hand grip axis, the handle of the racket includes a downwardly curved shank portion that connects the hand grip portion to the base of the head of the racket. The shank portion is offset to one side of the hand grip axis, while the head of the racket is disposed at the opposite side of the hand grip axis to align the center of gravity of the '550 tennis racket with the hand grip axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In contrast to the '550 tennis racket, the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> according to the various embodiments described herein has a linear racket handle <b>104</b> with a blade connection end <b>114</b> that directly connects to the racket blade <b>102</b> without any shank portion that curves to one side of the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle. The resulting center of gravity <b>306</b> positioning is offset from the longitudinal axis <b>302</b> of the handle, creating an unbalanced table tennis racket. This direct connection of the linear racket handle <b>104</b> to the racket blade <b>102</b> saves weight as compared to the '505 tennis racket and shortens the required length of the racket handle <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">U.S. Pat. No. 4,293,129 to Planakis (hereinafter described as the '129 patent) also discloses a tennis racket that increases spin placed on a tennis ball. However, the '129 racket has two nonparallel playing surfaces. The two nonparallel playing surfaces on opposing sides of the '129 racket creates a symmetrical racket configuration that is balanced. In contrast to the '129 tennis racket, the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> according to the various embodiments described herein has a single racket blade <b>102</b> connected to the racket handle <b>104</b> in an asymmetrical configuration that creates an unbalanced racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">While the spin-inducing benefits of the '129 tennis racket apply to the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> described herein, the double racket heads of the '129 tennis racket and resulting symmetrical configuration are significantly different from the single offset racket blade <b>102</b> and resulting asymmetrical configuration of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b>. Moreover, although the first face <b>108</b> of the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> is not often used during normal play, the player using the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> has an option to use the first face <b>108</b>, as well as the second face <b>110</b>. Because the first face <b>108</b> and the second face <b>110</b> are angled toward and away from the racket handle <b>104</b> in significantly different configurations, use of the first face <b>108</b> and the second face <b>110</b> provide drastically different opportunities to vary the spin placed on the table tennis ball. In contrast, the '129 racket provides identical playing surfaces on both sides of the tennis racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">According to various alternate embodiments and referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the non-planar table tennis racket <b>100</b> may include additional spin-inducing features to further increase the amount of spin imparted on a table tennis ball. For example, a substrate <b>103</b>A of the racket blade <b>102</b>A can be integrally formed with the handle <b>104</b>A so that the substrate <b>103</b>A becomes a part of the outer surface <b>105</b>A of the racket handle <b>104</b>A. In this configuration, the substrate <b>103</b>A of the racket blade <b>102</b>A is no longer centered on the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>A but, is instead, centered about a longitudinal axis <b>303</b>A that is spaced apart from the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>A of the handle <b>104</b>A. As a result of the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, radial movement of the racket blade <b>102</b>A around the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>A of the handle <b>104</b>A is increased when the player's wrist and hand are rotated since the longitudinal axis <b>303</b>A of the substrate <b>103</b>A in the handle <b>104</b> is spaced apart from the longitudinal axis <b>302</b>A of the handle <b>104</b>A. Accordingly, an increase in the radial movement of the racket blade <b>102</b>A increases the magnitude of the spin that is imparted to the table tennis ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Based on the foregoing, it should be appreciated that technologies for a non-planar table tennis racket are provided herein. The subject matter described above is provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed as limiting.
