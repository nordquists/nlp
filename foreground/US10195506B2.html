<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the use of shear thickening materials, and more particularly, to the use of shear thickening materials in sports products.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Sports products may include rackets, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, footwear, personal protection equipment, and/or other types of equipment known to those skilled in the art. Sports products may be designed to provide a user with a competitive advantage, enhance the user's comfort, or protect the user from being injured. A sports product's marketability may depend on how effective it is at providing such benefits. As such, manufacturers of sports products continually seek to improve the materials and designs used in the construction of their products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">While adding material to a sports product may improve the product's ability to absorb impacts, dampen vibrations, or perform other advantageous functions, it may also add bulk and weight to the product. The added bulk and weight may negate the advantages by increasing a user's discomfort, and/or hindering a user's movement or performance. Thus, sports products are often times constructed of lightweight, thin materials. However, if the materials are too thin or weak, they may lose their effectiveness, or may be easily damaged. A balance must be struck between these considerations. Further complicating matters is that in some instances, the properties that make materials desirable under one set of conditions, may make the same materials undesirable under another set of conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure addresses at least some of the problems described above and other problems in existing technology.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a racket may include a head region, a striking region, a throat region, a shaft region, or a handle region. The racket may also include a shear thickening material in at least one of the head region, striking region, throat region, shaft region, or handle region. The shear thickening material may be configured to exhibit shear thickening behavior when an impact occurs between the racket and an object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a sports product may include a support member and an impact region configured to impact an object. The impact region may be coupled to the support member. The sports product may also include a shear thickening material in at least one of the support member or the impact region, the shear thickening material being configured to exhibit shear thickening behavior when an impact occurs between the impact region and the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method for manufacturing a sports product may include manufacturing a first layer of material. The method may also include manufacturing a second layer of material. The method may further include depositing a shear thickening material between the first layer of material and the second layer of material. The shear thickening material may provide a first level of flexibility when a first type of impact occurs between at least one of the first layer of material and the second layer of material, and an object. The shear thickening material may provide a second level of flexibility when a second type of impact occurs between at least one of the first layer of material and the second layer of material, and the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional objects and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure. The objects and advantages of the disclosure will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Shear thickening or dilatant materials have properties that distinguish them from other materials. For example, when shear thickening materials are subjected to an increasing rate of shear deformation, they undergo an increase in viscosity and/or rigidity. For example, a shear thickening material may behave like a low viscosity fluid when not subjected to shear deformation or subjected to a low rate of shear deformation, but may behave like a highly viscous fluid when subjected to a high rate of shear deformation. Another shear thickening material may behave like a fluid when not subjected to shear deformation or subjected to a low rate of shear deformation, but may behave like a quasi-solid or solid when subjected to a high rate of shear deformation. Yet another a shear thickening material may behave like a quasi-solid or flexible solid when not subjected to shear deformation or subjected to a low rate of shear deformation, but may behave like a rigid solid when subjected to a high rate of shear deformation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">A shear thickening material's starting point (i.e., its normal or at rest condition) and ending point (i.e., its condition when subjected to a high rate of shear deformation) may define endpoints of a region, the region covering a portion of a spectrum. One end of the spectrum may be characterized as “fluidity,” while the opposite end may be characterized as “rigidity.” By adjusting the forces acting on the shear thickening material, or adjusting the types and/or quantities of ingredients in the shear thickening material, its region may be shrunken, expanded, and/or shifted towards one end of the spectrum or the other. The introduction of a high rate of shear deformation will drive the shear thickening material in the direction of rigidity, while removal of the shear deformation will drive the shear thickening material toward fluidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The behavior of shear thickening materials may also be time dependent. When a shear force is applied to a shear thickening material over a long timescale, the shear thickening material may not move in the direction of rigidity. If, however, the shear force is applied to the shear thickening material over a short timescale, the shear thickening material will move in the direction of rigidity. The timescale limit under which the shear thickening material will exhibit shear thickening behavior may depend on a number of factors, such as the type of shear thickening material involved, and the characteristics of the force applied to the shear thickening material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The behavior of shear thickening materials may be caused by at least one of the following mechanisms. One mechanism is shear induced ordering, where the alignment of particles in a medium may increase as a shearing force is applied. The more aligned the particles become, the more they behave like a solid material. Additionally or alternatively, the shear thickening behavior may be caused by dilation, or a change in volume, of one or more ingredients in the shear thickening material. For example, a shear thickening material may include powder molecules whose volume may expand as a shearing force is applied. The expanding volume may move the shear thickening material in the direction of rigidity. In some cases, the shear thickening behavior of a shear thickening material may be caused by attraction between molecules, where the attraction increases as a shearing force is applied, thus driving the shear thickening material toward rigidity. The shear thickening behavior may also be caused by friction, where friction between components of the shear thickening material increase as shearing force is applied. The increased friction may inhibit free movement of the components past each other, driving the shear thickening material toward rigidity. The shear thickening behavior may also be caused by shear forces overcoming repulsive forces between particles in a material, causing the particles to clump. The clumping may drive the shear thickening material toward rigidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Removal of the shearing force may have the opposite effect, that is, removal may precipitate the shear thickening material's movement in the direction of fluidity. It should be understood that the above list of interactions and mechanisms is not intended to be exhaustive, and that shear thickening behavior may be the result of any phenomenon or interaction, or combination of phenomena or interactions, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Some common examples of shear thickening materials include a mixture of corn starch and water (often times referred to as “oobleck”) that may become more difficult to stir as the stirring rate increases, and putty material that may be easily deformed when slow pressure is applied, but may resist deformation when thrown against a surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Various categories of shear thickening materials will now be described. It should be understood that this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and any suitable types of shear thickening material are contemplated for use in the disclosed embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">One category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening fluids. A shear thickening fluid may possess the characteristics of a fluid until it encounters a shear force, whereupon the shear thickening fluid will thicken (e.g., move toward rigidity), and behave more like a higher viscosity fluid, quasi-solid, or solid. The shear force may be supplied by direct or indirect impact of an object against the shear thickening fluid, or any other suitable form of agitation. When the shear force is removed, the shear thickening fluid will return to its previous state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The shear thickening fluid may be a colloid, made of particles suspended in a liquid medium. Under normal conditions (i.e., where the shear thickening fluid is undisturbed by a shear force, or acted on by a slowly applied shear force), the particles will repel each other slightly, such that the particles may float interspersed throughout the liquid medium without clumping together or settling. The energy of a sudden impact will overwhelm the repulsive forces between the particles, causing the particles to clump together. The clumping may increase the viscosity of the shear thickening fluid. When the energy from the impact dissipates, the particles will return to repelling one another again, causing the clumps to fall apart. As such, the viscosity may return to the level that existed prior to the impact. Additionally or alternatively, the liquid may exhibit shear thickening behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The particles may include, for example, silica particles. The liquid medium may include, for example, polyethylene glycol. It should be understood, however, that any suitable particles and fluid medium may be used. Shear thickening fluids may be used to make films, resins, finishes, and coatings that exhibit shear thickening behavior. Methods used to make films, finishes, and coatings using fluids are well known in the art, and no further description will be provided here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening gels. A shear thickening gel may have the characteristics of a high viscosity fluid, quasi-solid, or any composition in between. The composition and properties of the shear thickening gel may be similar to those of the shear thickening fluid. However, under similar conditions, the shear thickening gel may have a higher viscosity or rigidity than the shear thickening fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Shear thickening gels may possess jelly-like qualities, or qualities associated with putties or clays. Under normal conditions, shear thickening gels will have fluid characteristics, and may be deformed with the application of little or no force. However, when subjected to the energy of a sudden impact, shear thickening gels will move toward rigidity, and their ability to resist deformation will improve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">A shear thickening gel may include the same ingredients as a shear thickening fluid, but may exist in gel form due to environmental conditions. Additionally or alternatively, the shear thickening gel may include an ingredient that causes the fluid medium to become gelatinous. The mechanism behind the shear thickening behavior of shear thickening gels may be similar to those of other categories of shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Another category of shear thickening materials includes encapsulated fluids or gels. These may include containers filled with shear thickening fluids or gels. A container of shear thickening fluid or gel may include a structure configured to store the fluid or gel. The container may include one or more walls made of either flexible or rigid material. The container may be configured to receive impacts or vibrations, and to transmit them to the fluid or gel. The impacts or vibrations will cause the fluid or gel to become more viscous or even rigid, imparting the overall container with greater rigidity. Shear thickening materials may also be used in the construction of the container walls themselves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening foams. A shear thickening foam may be formed by trapping gas bubbles, produced using physical or chemical means, in a shear thickening fluid or gel. The material may then be solidified. The interactions and mechanisms behind the shear thickening behavior of a shear thickening foam may be similar to those of other shear thickening materials. When the shear thickening foam is subjected to the energy of a sudden impact, its rigidity will increase. Before and after the impact, under normal conditions, the shear thickening foam will be relatively flexible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening solids. A shear thickening solid may be formed by solidifying a shear thickening fluid or gel, or otherwise incorporating shear thickening material into a solid object. Shear thickening solids can be formed by processes including, for example, extrusion or injection molding. When the shear thickening solid is subjected to the energy of a sudden impact, its rigidity will increase. Under normal conditions, however, the solid will be more flexible. The interactions and mechanisms by which the rigidity of a shear thickening solid increases may be similar to those of other shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening filaments. A shear thickening filament may be formed by any suitable processes, or combination of processes, including, for example, injection molding, extrusion, or spinning out of a melt. The shear thickening filament may exhibit the characteristics of a shear thickening solid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Another category of shear thickening materials includes impregnated fibers. An impregnated fiber may include, for example, a fiber or yarn that has absorbed, and/or is coated with, a shear thickening material. The fiber may include a high strength polymeric fiber. The shear thickening material may be a fluid, and may retain its fluid characteristics after impregnation. This may help to ensure that the impregnated fiber will remain flexible, while endowing the fiber with shear thickening properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Another category of shear thickening materials includes impregnated fiber reinforced materials. An impregnated fiber reinforced material may include, for example, a fabric that has absorbed, and/or is coated with, a shear thickening material. Additionally or alternatively, the impregnated fiber reinforced material may include previously impregnated fibers woven together to form a fabric. It is also contemplated that the impregnated fiber reinforced material may include a fabric made by weaving together shear thickening filaments and/or impregnated fibers. It is further contemplated that the fabric or fibers may be set into another medium to reinforce that medium. It is also contemplated that shear thickening materials may be mixed in with the medium to impart shear thickening properties to the medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The impregnated fiber reinforced material may exhibit shear thickening behaviors, similar those described above with respect to the other categories of shear thickening materials. For example, the coefficient of friction between the fibers, and/or between the fibers and the medium, will increase during an impact event, causing the fibers and/or medium to become more rigid. It is further contemplated that the fibers may form a substrate that, when a shear thickening material permeates the fibers, holds particles of the shear thickening material in place. When an object suddenly strikes the impregnated fiber reinforced material, the shear thickening material will immediately thicken or harden, imparting its hardness to the overall construction. The flexibility of the overall construction will return upon removal of the force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening composites. A shear thickening composite may include, for example, a solid foamed synthetic polymer. The solid foamed synthetic polymer may include an elastic, and/or an elastomeric matrix. The elastomeric matrix may retain its own boundaries without need of a container. The composite may also include a polymer-based dilatant different from the solid foamed synthetic polymer. The polymer-based dilatant may be distributed through the matrix and incorporated therein during manufacture. The composite may also include a fluid distributed through the matrix. The combination of the matrix, dilatant, and fluid may be selected such that the composite may be resiliently compressible. (i.e., display resistance to compressive set), and preferably also flexible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Another shear thickening composite may include a solid, closed cell foam matrix and a polymer-based dilatant, different from the matrix, distributed through the matrix. The composite may also include a fluid distributed through the matrix. The combination of matrix, dilatant, and fluid may be selected such that the composite may be resiliently compressible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In either of the shear thickening composites described above, any suitable solid materials may be used as the matrix, including, for example, elastomers. This may include natural elastomers, as well as synthetic elastomers, including synthetic thermoplastic elastomers. These may include elastomeric polyurethanes, silicone rubbers, and ethylene-propylene rubbers. Any polymer-based dilatant that may be incorporated into the matrix may be used in the shear thickening composites. The dilatant may be selected from silicone polymer-based materials, such as borated silicone polymers. The dilatant may be combined with other components in addition to the components providing the dilatancy, including, for example, fillers, plasticisers, colorants, lubricants and thinners. The fillers may be particulates (including microspheres), fibrous, or a mixture of the two. It is contemplated that a borated siloxane-based material may be used as a dilatant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Another category of shear thickening materials includes shear thickening layers. A shear thickening layer may include a layer of material formed from one of, or a combination of, the above-categories of shear thickening materials. The shear thickening layer may be combined with layers having other properties, such that the combined layers may exhibit some form of shear thickening behavior as a result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In the description of sports products that follows, use of the term “shear thickening materials” is meant to cover all categories of shear thickening materials and combinations of shear thickening materials known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Rackets may be used in a variety of sports. For example, rackets may be used to play tennis, racketball, squash, badminton, paddle ball, and/or other known racket sports. A racket used for one sport may differ structurally from a racket used in another sport. Even rackets used for the same sport may have differences in structure that may provide users with different benefits or advantages. Exemplary rackets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>14</b>, whose features are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-20</figref>, are described below. The descriptions of rackets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>14</b> below may be applicable to any known rackets, including, for example, tennis rackets, racketball rackets, squash rackets, badminton rackets, and/or paddle ball paddles. Exemplary rackets are also shown in PCT/EP2007/000929, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,077,767 B2 and 7,140,984 B2, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Rackets <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-14 and 17</figref>, may represent string-type rackets, such as those used for tennis, racketball, badminton, and squash. Racket <b>14</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, may represent paddle-type rackets, such as those used for paddle tennis. The description below of any one of rackets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>14</b> may also apply to the others of rackets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Racket <b>10</b> may include a frame <b>16</b>. Frame <b>16</b> may be constructed of a composite material by, for example, placing a core, including a tube having one or more layers <b>43</b> of woven reinforcing fibers, in a mold (not shown) defining the shape of frame <b>16</b>, closing the mold, and injecting an epoxy material <b>38</b> into the mold around the core. The tube may be formed by, for example, winding one or more substantially planar sheets of material into tubular form to form layers <b>43</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A planar sheet of shear thickening material may be at least partially enclosed between the planar sheets forming layers <b>43</b> prior to winding, and may form a shear thickening layer <b>45</b> after winding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The reinforcing fibers may be carbon fibers, boron fibers, glass fibers, silicon carbide fibers, ceramic fibers, or aramid fibers of the kind available under the trade name Kevlar, or any combination of these materials. An enlarged view of an exemplary composite material <b>18</b>, with its reinforcing fibers <b>20</b> and epoxy material <b>38</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Frame <b>16</b> may include a number of regions, including, for example, a head region <b>22</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>), a striking region <b>24</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5, and 17</figref>), a throat region <b>26</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>), a shaft region. <b>28</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>), and a handle region <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 9, and 11-14</figref>). Each of the regions is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Head region <b>22</b> may include a head <b>32</b>, a bumperguard <b>34</b>, and a hitting surface <b>36</b>. Head <b>32</b> may include the portion of frame <b>16</b> surrounding hitting surface <b>36</b>. Head <b>32</b> may be composed, at least partially, of composite material <b>18</b>, and may include shear thickening materials. For example, reinforcing fibers <b>20</b> may be impregnated with shear thickening materials. Additionally or alternatively, shear thickening materials may be mixed in with epoxy material <b>38</b>. Shear thickening materials may also be provided in an interior of head <b>32</b>, such as in a wall <b>42</b> of head <b>32</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For example, shear thickening layer <b>45</b> may be at least partially enclosed by other layers (e.g., epoxy material <b>38</b> and/or one or more layers <b>43</b>) used to form wall <b>42</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a cavity <b>39</b> may be formed in wall <b>42</b> that may receive shear thickening materials <b>41</b>. Cavity <b>39</b> may be formed using a mold, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art. Additionally or alternatively, cavity may be formed by material removal processes (e.g., cutting or drilling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> may also be provided on an exterior of head <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The exterior may include a pair of trough shaped concavities or depressions <b>51</b> and <b>64</b>, formed in head <b>32</b>, between about two o'clock and four o'clock, in particular at three o'clock; and/or between about eight o'clock and ten o'clock, in particular at nine o'clock. Depressions <b>51</b> and <b>64</b> may be molded into head <b>32</b> or may be formed by material removal processes. Because of depressions <b>51</b> and <b>64</b>, the bending resistance moment of head <b>32</b> may be lower than in areas of head <b>32</b> having no depressions, and thus, depressions <b>51</b> and <b>64</b> may form a joint or flexpoint <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Flexpoint <b>44</b> may provide advantageous ball control characteristics. Upon impact with a ball, head <b>32</b> may flex or deform at flexpoint <b>44</b>. By placing shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> at flexpoint <b>44</b>, the stiffness/flexibility of head <b>32</b> may vary in accordance with the viscosity or rigidity of shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b>. Shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> may be inserts configured to seal depressions <b>51</b> and <b>64</b>. When shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> stiffen upon impact with a ball, flexpoint <b>44</b> may also stiffen. A stiffer head or frame may bend less, thus offering more power. When shear thickening materials <b>68</b> and <b>71</b> return to their rest state, flexpoint <b>44</b> may regain its normal flexibility. A flexible head or frame may bend more, resulting in energy loss and less power, but more control of the ball and a softer “feel.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Shear thickening materials may also be positioned at any other regions of head <b>32</b> that experience bending stress and/or shear stress on impact. Preferably, the shear thickening materials may be positioned at those regions of head <b>32</b> that experience maximum bending stress and/or shear stress on impact. Additionally or alternatively, shear thickening materials may be positioned in regions of head <b>32</b> containing antinodes, where head <b>32</b> experiences maximum vibrational displacement after an impact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Bumperguard <b>34</b> may surround at least a portion of head <b>32</b>. Bumperguard may help protect head <b>32</b> from impacts. Bumperguard <b>34</b> may include shear thickening materials that may help absorb the impacts, thus protecting head <b>32</b> from damage, and dampening vibrations caused by the impacts before they are transmitted through frame <b>16</b> to the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Shear thickening materials may be mixed in with polymer materials used in the construction of bumperguard <b>34</b>. A layer <b>40</b> or layers of shear thickening material (shown in the cut-out in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be provided between bumperguard <b>34</b> and head <b>32</b>. Additionally or alternatively, bumperguard <b>34</b> may include adhesive tape, adhered around head <b>32</b>, that may be reinforced with shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Hitting surface <b>36</b> may include strings, such as those used in tennis, racketball, squash, and badminton rackets. Hitting surface <b>36</b> may also include a paddle face <b>50</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, used in paddle tennis paddles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The strings may include one or more materials, including, for example, gut or synthetic materials (e.g., nylon, polyamide, and other polymers). The materials used in the strings can change the performance of a racket, and thus, the composition of the strings may be varied to create variations in terms of playability, durability, and “feel,” among other considerations. In some cases, a vibration dampening device <b>52</b> may be placed on the strings, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Vibration dampening device <b>52</b> may be constructed of, or may contain, shear thickening materials. In one embodiment, portions of vibration dampening device <b>52</b> directly contacting the strings may include the shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The strings may be of a monofilament or multifilament type. Monofilament strings, like string <b>46</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, may include a single, thick strand of material. The single, thick strand may be made, at least partially, of shear thickening materials. Additionally or alternatively, the thick strand may be impregnated with shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">A multifilament string <b>48</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Multifilament string <b>48</b> may be constructed of many smaller strands <b>54</b> wound, woven, or otherwise joined together to form a larger strand of material. Smaller strands <b>54</b> may include filaments, flat ribbon-like pieces, and/or any other suitable strand types known to those skilled in the art. One or more of smaller strands <b>54</b>, such as a filament <b>55</b>, may include shear thickening materials. Multifilament string <b>48</b> may also be impregnated with shear thickening materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Another hitting surface, paddle face <b>50</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, may be textured and/or perforated.

One or more of those layers <b>56</b> may include shear thickening materials. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, layers <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>62</b> may be shear thickening layers. It is also contemplated that shear thickening materials may be used in a hitting region <b>61</b> or sweet spot on paddle face <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Throat region <b>26</b> may include the portion of frame <b>16</b> between head region <b>22</b> and shaft region <b>28</b>.

Cavity <b>126</b> may be formed during molding of frame <b>16</b> by, for example, providing a protrusion in a mold (not shown) having a shape complementary to that of cavity <b>126</b>. Additionally or alternatively, cavity <b>126</b> may be formed by material removal processes. Cavity <b>126</b> may be formed in surfaces of portions <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>88</b> surrounding opening <b>82</b>, and/or on surfaces of portions <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>88</b> facing away from opening <b>82</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Frame <b>218</b> is shown with a string hole <b>224</b> and a string <b>226</b>. String <b>226</b> may be coupled to the radially outer layer of frame <b>218</b>. Under normal tensile forces acting on string <b>226</b>, represented by arrow <b>228</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, shear thickening materials <b>222</b> may remain soft. Accordingly, the radially inner and outer layers of frame <b>218</b> may move relative to one another. The relative movement may include a rotational component, with the radially outer layer of frame <b>218</b> rotating towards the radially inner layer of frame <b>218</b>.

The movement of the radially outer layer of frame <b>218</b> relative to the radially inner layer of frame <b>218</b> may produce compressive forces on shear thickening materials <b>222</b>, causing shear thickening materials <b>222</b> to stiffen. When shear thickening materials <b>222</b> stiffen, shear movement or relative rotation of the radially outer layer of frame <b>218</b> with respect to the radially inner layer of frame <b>218</b> may be reduced or impeded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">By controlling the degree of relative movement between the inner and outer layers of frame <b>218</b>, racket <b>10</b> <i>e </i>may provide a user with enhanced performance.

That flexibility may give racket <b>10</b> <i>e </i>a softer feel, providing the user with greater control over the ball for soft or touch shots. When shear thickening materials <b>22</b> stiffen, frame <b>218</b> may become stiffer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">On the other hand, when a large force acts on string <b>236</b>, the large force may initiate increased movement between outer and inner frames <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>, which may in turn generate forces on shear thickening materials <b>238</b> due to the bonding between shear thickening materials <b>238</b> and outer and inner frames <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. This may cause shear thickening materials <b>238</b> to stiffen. When shear thickening materials <b>238</b> stiffen, shear movement or relative rotation of one of outer and inner frames <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> relative to the other of outer and inner frames <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may be reduced or impeded. Because shear thickening materials <b>238</b> can selectively adjust the stiffness of racket <b>10</b> <i>f </i>(by becoming more or less stiff), the playability of racket <b>10</b> <i>f </i>may be adjusted in the manner described with respect to racket <b>10</b> <i>e</i>.

With the construction of racket <b>10</b> <i>g</i>, outer frame <b>240</b> and inner frame <b>242</b> may be isolated from one another. By selecting shear thickening materials having different stiffening characteristics, for use as shear thickening material <b>252</b>, the playability of racket <b>10</b> <i>g </i>may be adjusted.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">When no force, or a small force acts on string <b>258</b> or any other string in the string bed, the small force may produce little or no movement between outer and inner frames <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">On the other hand, when a large force acts on string <b>258</b> or any other string in the string bed, the force may initiate relative movement between outer and inner frames <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>, which may in turn generate forces on shear thickening materials <b>252</b> due to the bonding between shear thickening materials <b>252</b> and outer and inner frames <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>.

A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, and as a result, a user must generate more power in order to strike a golf ball properly. A user may be able to strike a golf ball properly with less power using a flexible shaft, but accuracy may suffer since the bending may result in the misalignment of head <b>134</b>.

Alternatively, the component may include more than one version of the shear thickening material. For example, a component may include a shear thickening material having ingredients in amounts fitting a first ratio in a first region, and may include a shear thickening material having the same ingredients in amounts fitting a second ratio, different from the first ratio, in a second region. Thus, the shear thickening behavior of the component may vary between its regions.

One type of shear thickening material may exhibit shear thickening behavior upon experiencing a first type of force, while another type of shear thickening material may exhibit shear thickening behavior upon experiencing a second type of force.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Sports products that include shear thickening materials in their construction may be enhanced in terms of their performance, wear resistance, and user comfort. Some of the enhancements are discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">Using shear thickening materials in a racket, such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-14, 17-20, and 30-38</figref>, may provide a number of benefits. One benefit has to do with impact absorption. During play, a user may strike a racket against the ground, a wall, or some other object. Shear thickening materials in a racket's frame and/or bumperguard can help absorb the impacts. For example, when a bumperguard that includes shear thickening material impacts an object, the shear thickening material may stiffen, and thus, the bumperguard may become harder. The increased hardness may help protect the other portions of the racket from being damaged by the impact. Moreover, when the bumperguard becomes harder, it may become more resistant to wear caused by, for example, a scraping impact with the ground. Yet the bumperguard may maintain its malleability in the absence of an impact, allowing for easy mounting of the bumperguard on the racket. Thus, the bumperguard may be capable of absorbing impacts like a harder material, while also being easy to mount like a more flexible material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Shear thickening materials may provide similar benefits when used in other parts of a racket. For example, shear thickening materials in a racket's frame may serve to harden the frame during impacts. The increased hardness of the frame may help protect the racket from wear or other damage caused by the impact. Shear thickening materials may also harden a racket's strings during impacts, which may help protect the strings from wear or other damage, especially at points where one string is in contact with another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Another benefit that shear thickening materials may provide is vibration dampening. When a racket is used to strike a ball, or any other object, the impact may create vibrations. Without some mechanism for dampening the vibrations, the vibrations may be transmitted through the racket to the user's arm. Dampening those vibrations before they reach the user's arm may improve the “feel” of the racket. Using shear thickening materials in the construction of the racket may help dampen the vibrations. For example, the vibrations may originate in the area of impact. When the vibrations encounter the shear thickening materials in the racket (whether in the strings, frame, grip, or some other part), they may agitate the shear thickening materials as they attempt to pass, causing the shear thickening materials to become increasingly viscous or rigid. As the shear thickening materials become more viscous or rigid, it may become more and more difficult for the vibrations to pass. Thus, the shear thickening materials may create an energy absorbing barrier between the point of impact and the user's arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Another benefit has to do with adaptability. Different users may prefer different degrees of racket flexibility. One user may prefer a flexible racket because it may provide that user with greater control over the ball. Another user may prefer a stiff racket because it may provide that user with the ability to strike the ball harder. Yet another user may prefer a flexible racket under one set of circumstances, and a stiff racket under other circumstances. By using shear thickening materials in the construction of a racket, particularly in the racket's frame and/or strings, the racket may be adaptable, in that it may provide the benefits of both a flexible racket and a stiff racket in a single package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">For example, a flexible racket may be helpful to a user who is attempting to make a shot that requires touch or control. Touch shots typically involve low intensity impacts, or impacts that occur over a long timescale. Shear thickening materials in the racket may remain fluid or flexible during such impacts, and thus, the racket itself may remain flexible, helping the player execute the touch shot. On the other hand, a stiff racket may be helpful to a user who is attempting to make a shot that requires power. Power shots typically involve high intensity impacts, or impacts that occur over a short timescale. The shear thickening materials in the racket may stiffen during such impacts, and thus, the racket itself may stiffen, helping the player execute the power shot. Accordingly, a single racket can provide a user with the benefits of both a flexible racket and a stiff racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">Additionally, shear thickening materials in a grip or handle area of a racket may remain flexible, and thus, deformable, during periods of play between impacts. Thus, the grip may easily conform to a user's hand, which may also improve the racket's “feel.” When the racket impacts an object, the shear thickening materials, and the grip itself, may become more viscous or rigid, giving the user greater control over the racket, while also dampening vibrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">As another example, a user that is a beginner may prefer a more flexible racket, since it may provide the user with greater power. However, as the user's game and power improve, the user may prefer a stiffer racket that may provide the user with greater accuracy. In the past, the user would purchase one racket as a beginner, and another stiffer racket at a more advanced level. However, by using shear thickening materials, that single racket may be adequate at both skill levels. For example, a racket may include shear thickening materials that may remain flexible when exposed to forces generated by a beginner, which are typically lower than those generated by an advanced player. The shear thickening materials may stiffen when exposed to forces generated by an advanced player, and thus, the racket may be stiffer for the advanced player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Using shear thickening materials in a golf club, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, may provide a number of benefits. One benefit has to do with shear resistance and durability. The hardening of the shear thickening materials may help to protect a golf club from wear or damage at its hitting surface resulting from repeated strikes against golf balls during play. The hardening may also help protect the golf club from errant strikes against other objects, including the ground.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Another benefit the shear thickening materials may provide is vibration dampening. When a golf club strikes a golf ball, the impact creates vibrations, originating at a hitting surface of the golf club's head. Without some mechanism for dampening those vibrations, they may continue up a shaft of the golf club, into a handle or grip, and then into a user's arm. Providing shear thickening materials in the golf club, whether it be in the head, shaft, or grip, may help dampen the vibrations in a manner similar to that described above with respect to a racket. This may help improve the overall “feel” of the club, as experienced by its user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Shear thickening materials may be used to make a golf club adaptable, giving the golf club different characteristics under different circumstances. It is known that different users may prefer different degrees of flexibility for their golf clubs. One user may prefer a more flexible golf club because it may provide that user with more power (due at least in part to the ability to store energy in a flexed shaft). Another user may prefer a stiffer golf club because it may provide that user with greater accuracy (due at least in part to less club movement during a stroke). Yet another user may prefer a more flexible club under one set of circumstances, and a stiffer club under other circumstances. By using shear thickening materials in a golf club, the golf club may be capable of providing the benefits of both flexible and stiff clubs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, flexibility may be desirable in a shaft of a golf club during the backswing and downswing phases of a stroke. Shaft flex may load the shaft with energy, allowing the user to strike a golf ball with greater power. However, stiffness in the shaft may be desirable upon making contact with the ball, to prevent the impact from causing the club's head from becoming misaligned. By using shear thickening materials in the club's shaft, the shaft may have the desired flexibility during the backswing and downswing, as well as the desired stiffness at impact with the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Additionally or alternatively, flexibility may be desirable in the club's hitting surface. For example, for short shots that may require greater control, keeping the hitting surface flexible may help provide that control. On the other hand, for long shots requiring greater power, keeping the hitting surface stiff may help to transmit as much power as possible from the club to the ball. Since short shots may typically be lower impact than long shots, the shear thickening materials in the hitting surface may remain flexible, giving the user greater control. On the other hand, the impacts associated with long shots may cause the shear thickening materials to stiffen, and thus, the hitting surface itself may also become stiffer. Accordingly, by using shear thickening materials in the construction of the hitting surface, both control and power may be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">As another example, a user that is a beginner may prefer more flexible clubs, since they may provide the user with greater power. However, as the user's game and ability to generate power improve, the user may prefer stiffer clubs that provide the user with greater accuracy. In the past, the user would purchase more flexible clubs at the beginner level, and then stiffer clubs at a more advanced level. However, by using shear thickening materials, a single set of clubs may be adequate at both skill levels. For example, clubs may include shear thickening materials that may remain flexible when exposed to forces generated by a beginner, which are typically lower than those generated by an advanced player. Thus, the clubs may be flexible enough for the beginner. The shear thickening materials may stiffen when exposed to forces generated by an advanced player, and thus, the clubs may also be stiff enough for the advanced player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Using shear thickening materials in footwear, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, may provide a number of benefits. Among those benefits is impact absorption. Shear thickening materials in a shoe's sole may become more viscous or rigid upon experiencing an impact against the ground, or a sharp object, helping to protect a wearer's foot from the impact. Shear thickening materials in a shoe's upper may become more rigid on impact, helping to provide additional support to the wearer's foot and ankle. The increased rigidity may also help protect the shoe from wear or other damage caused by impacts, increasing the shoe's useful life. The shear thickening materials may also dampen vibrations caused by the impacts, similar to the way vibrations may be dampened in a racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Using shear thickening materials in skis or snowboards, such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>, may provide them with a number of benefits. While the following discussion focuses primarily on skis, it should be understood that the aspects described are also applicable to snowboards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">A ski's ability to bend or flex as it carries a user is an important performance features. The flexing and counterflexing of the ski may help keep the user in control. The user, by shifting his or her weight, bending, and/or twisting, may manipulate the ski as the user goes over the contours of a slope. If snow conditions remain constant, a single type of ski with one flex profile could possibly be adequate. However, snow conditions may vary widely, even on a single slope. When the snow is hard, the user may desire a degree of rigidity in the ski. The rigidity may help the user dig the edges of the ski into the hard snow to make a turn. When the snow is soft, the user may desire a degree of flexibility in the ski. The flexibility may help the user bend the ski to make a turn. By using shear thickening materials in the construction of the ski, the ski may behave desirably in both conditions. For example, on hard snow, where impacts against the ski may be sudden and/or of a high magnitude, the shear thickening materials may become more viscous or rigid, giving to the ski the stiffness desired by the user. On the other hand, on soft snow, where impacts against the ski may occur over a long timescale, and/or may be of a low magnitude, the shear thickening materials may remain more fluid or flexible, giving the ski the flexibility desired by the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Shear thickening materials may also be helpful in the construction of a ski's binding. A loose attachment between a user's boot and the binding may result in less energy transfer from the ski to the user when the ski encounters obstacles on a slope. This may result in higher speeds, which may be important in sports, such as racing. However, the same loose attachment may result in a loss of ski control in turns. Accordingly, it may be desirable to have a loosely attached ski when traveling in a substantially straight line, for greater speed, and a tightly attached ski when making turns, for more control. By using shear thickening materials in the binding, or between the binding and the ski, the benefits of loose attachment and tight attachment may be achieved. For example, during substantially straight line travel, where shear forces on the ski, binding, and the user's boot may be low, shear thickening materials associated with the binding may remain fluid or flexible, giving the loose attachment the user desires. When turning, the shear forces on the ski, binding, and the user's boot may increase. Accordingly, the shear thickening materials associated with the binding may become more viscous or rigid, giving the tight attachment the user desires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Shear thickening materials may also help to reduce vibration in a ski. As a user goes along the contours of a slope, variations in the contours may impact against the ski, causing vibrations. The vibrations may develop into an audible or perceptible chatter. Incorporating shear thickening materials into the ski, binding, and/or user's boot may help to absorb the chatter in a manner similar to that described above with respect to a racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Using shear thickening materials in personal protection equipment, such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-29</figref>, may provide them with a number of benefits. For most types of personal protection equipment, impact absorption may be a critical function. The equipment should be capable of protecting a user from impacts the user experiences while playing a sport. At the same time, if the equipment is too heavy, bulky, or uncomfortable, the user's performance may suffer. By using shear thickening materials, these considerations can be balanced. A piece of equipment constructed using shear thickening materials may become more viscous or rigid upon impact, due to the shear thickening behavior of the shear thickening materials in the presence of a shearing force. The hardening may allow the piece of equipment to protect covered areas of the user's body. Absent an impact, the shear thickening materials, and thus the piece of equipment itself, may retain a degree of fluidity or flexibility, providing the user with greater comfort and freedom of movement. Additionally, fortifying a piece of equipment with shear thickening materials may increase its strength without adding excessive bulk or weight that could hinder a user's performance.</div>
