<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to sports activity apparatus, and more particularly to a racket, such as waterproof racket or bouncing pad, which comprises a trampoline layer retained along a centerline of a racket frame for establishing optimal handling characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of Related Arts</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, sports activity implements, such as flying discs or racket apparatus, are known. A common feature of the flying disc and the racket apparatus is that an elastic layer is retained within an annular frame. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,241,153 relates to a sports activity device which comprises an outer annular ring member, an inner annular ring assembly detachably engaged to the outer annular ring member, wherein a flexible material that stretches across an annular area within the inner ring assembly. However, such sports activity device has several drawbacks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the inner ring assembly comprises an annular ring member defining the annular area therewithin to retain the flexible material within the annular ring member. The outer annular ring member has an inner circular cavity to receive the annular ring member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the inner annular ring assembly is detachably engaged to the outer annular ring member by receiving the annular ring member within the inner circular cavity of the outer annular ring member, the inner annular ring assembly may accidentally detach from the outer annular ring member, especially when the engagement therebetween is not securely mounted. For example, when throwing the sports activity device as the flying disc, the centrifugal force may drive the inner annular ring assembly to detach from the outer annular ring member. Especially when the centrifugal force is exerted at the annular ring member, the centrifugal force will force the annular ring member to be moved within the inner circular cavity. When using the sports activity device as the racket apparatus, the reaction force at the flexible material may also drive the inner annular ring assembly to detach from the outer annular ring member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the flexible material is mounted by the inner annular ring member of the inner annular ring assembly. In particular, the peripheral edge of the flexible material is affixed to an inner surface of the inner annular ring member via the inner circular cavity. As a result, the tension of the flexible material is preset by the size of the inner annular member. In other words, the tension of the flexible material cannot be adjusted. Furthermore, when any portion of the inner annular ring member is damaged or broken, the flexible material cannot be mounted in a tension manner. Since the inner annular ring member is made of rigid material, it is difficult to securely mount the flexible material to the inner annular ring member. Therefore, the manufacturing process will be complicated to securely mount the flexible material to the inner annular ring member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The inner circular cavity is formed at the inner side of the outer annular ring member to detachably receive the inner annular ring member. In particular, the inner circular cavity is formed at an upper side of the outer annular ring member, such that when the inner annular ring member is mounted at the inner circular cavity, the flexible material is aligned with the upper side of the outer annular ring member. In other words, an outer diameter of the inner annular ring member is larger than an inner diameter of the outer annular ring member. This off-centerline engagement between the outer and inner annular ring members will provide uneven tensions of the flexible material at two opposite sides of the outer annular ring member. Therefore, the user, especially a young kid, has difficulty to handle the sports activity device to play as the racket apparatus. It is worth mentioning that the inner circular cavity cannot be formed at a centerline of the outer annular ring member because the inner annular ring member cannot mounted to the inner circular cavity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another drawback of the sports activity device is that the outer annular ring member must be made by foam material. In order to form the inner circular cavity at the outer annular ring member, the outer annular ring member must be made of rigid material. Otherwise, the inner annular ring member cannot be securely held by the outer annular ring member. In other words, the sports activity device does not provide any cushioning effect, such that when playing the sports activity device as the flying disc or the racket apparatus, the user, especially a young kid, may accidentally hit by the outer annular ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the foam outer annular ring member must be rigid enough to hold the inner annular ring member in position. Otherwise, the soft foam outer annular ring member cannot retain the inner annular ring member. In addition, the service life span of the foam outer annular ring member is relatively short, wherein once the foam material will be hardened and cracked, the inner annular ring member will be detected from the outer annular ring member.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention is advantageous in that it provides a waterproof racket, which comprises a trampoline layer retained at least a portion of a racket frame for establishing optimal handling characteristics. Preferably, the trampoline layer is retained along a centerline of the racket frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Another advantage of the invention is to a waterproof racket, wherein an annular skeleton is encircled within a receiving pocket to retain the receiving pocket in an annular configuration.

The waterproof racket comprises a racket frame and a trampoline layer <b>10</b> supported by the racket frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the preferred embodiment, the racket frame comprises an annular skeleton <b>20</b> and a receiving pocket <b>30</b> having a pocket cavity <b>301</b>, wherein the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is received in the pocket cavity <b>301</b> to retain the receiving pocket <b>30</b> in an annular configuration. The receiving pocket <b>30</b> is made of waterproof material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is made of rigid material such as plastic or metal. The annular skeleton <b>20</b> can be configured to have different shapes and sizes, such as circular shape or oval shape. In one embodiment, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is configured to have a circular shape as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. When the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is received in the pocket cavity <b>301</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b>, the shape of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> is retained by the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. Preferably, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is made of flexible material, wherein when the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is configured into a loop form, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> provides an outward and radial stretching force to provide a predetermined rigidity of the annular skeleton <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The receiving pocket <b>30</b> comprises an outer sleeve <b>31</b> defining the pocket cavity <b>301</b> therein. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the outer sleeve <b>31</b> is constructed with multiple layers. In particular, the outer sleeve <b>31</b> comprises an outer waterproof layer <b>311</b>, a cushioning layer <b>312</b>, and an inner lining <b>313</b>, wherein the cushioning layer <b>312</b> is adhered between the outer waterproof layer <b>311</b> and the inner lining <b>313</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, the outer sleeve <b>31</b> is folded to form the pocket cavity <b>301</b> therewithin. Two affixing edges of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> are affixed together to form an annular affixing brim <b>310</b> at an inner side of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> in order to form the pocket cavity <b>301</b> within the outer sleeve <b>31</b>. It is worth mentioning that when the affixing edges of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> are affixed together, the outer sleeve <b>31</b> forms a tubular configuration to form the pocket cavity <b>301</b>. A reinforcing layer <b>314</b> is provided to affix along the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> to retain the attachment of the affixing edges of the outer sleeve <b>31</b>. It is worth mentioning that the affixing edges of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> are affixed and overlappedly folded to form the annular affixing brim <b>310</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the peripheral edge <b>101</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is affixed to the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> to retain the trampoline layer <b>10</b> within the inner peripheral of the receiving pocket <b>30</b>. Furthermore, the reinforcing layer <b>314</b> is provided to affix along the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> with the peripheral edge <b>101</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> to ensure the attachment of the affixing edges of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> and the attachment of the peripheral edge of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> along the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b>. Accordingly, the reinforcing layer <b>314</b> is half-folded to sandwich and affix to the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> and the peripheral edge <b>101</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>. In other words, the reinforcing layer <b>314</b>, having a U-shaped cross section, affixedly encloses the annular affixing brim <b>310</b> of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> and the peripheral edge <b>101</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the preferred embodiment, the trampoline layer <b>10</b> has at least a portion affixed to the receiving pocket <b>30</b>, wherein the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is stretched to form a trampoline surface <b>11</b> in a tension manner. Preferably, the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is affixed to the receiving pocket <b>30</b> along a centerline thereof. The trampoline layer <b>10</b> is made of elastic material, wherein the trampoline layer <b>10</b> will provide a predetermined tension for catching or rebounding an object when the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is stretched. Accordingly, the trampoline surface <b>11</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> has a planar configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, the peripheral edge <b>101</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is affixed to an inner peripheral of the receiving pocket <b>30</b>. The centerline of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> is defined by the trampoline layer <b>10</b> to form an upper half <b>302</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> and a lower half <b>303</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b>. In other words, the upper half <b>302</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> above the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is symmetrical to the lower half <b>303</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> below the trampoline layer <b>10</b> to enhance the handling of the waterproof racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, the user is able to use either side of the racket frame to ensure the tension of the trampoline surface <b>11</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>. For example, when using the waterproof racket to play the racket sports by hitting a bouncy ball <b>50</b> with the trampoline layer <b>10</b>, the tension of the trampoline surface <b>11</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> for the forehand play is the same as the tension of the trampoline surface <b>11</b> of the trampoline layer <b>10</b> for the backhand play. It is worth mentioning that the user is able to grip a portion of the racket frame to hit the bouncy ball <b>50</b>. Likewise, the waterproof racket can be embodied as a flying disc, such that the user is able to throw and catch the waterproof racket. It is worth mentioning that the flying disc will be bounced when the flying disc is thrown to hit on the ground, the wall, or any surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a waterproof racket according to a second embodiment illustrates a modification of the first embodiment, wherein the receiving pocket <b>30</b> further comprises a cushioning element <b>32</b> received in the outer sleeve <b>31</b>. The cushioning element <b>32</b> is preferably made of soft foaming material to provide a soft and cushioning feel for the receiving pocket <b>30</b>. Preferably, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is encirclingly wrapped by the cushioning element <b>32</b> to prevent the user directly contacting with the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. In other words, the receiving pocket <b>30</b> is soft enough to provide a cushioning effect via the cushioning element <b>32</b> but is rigid enough to retain the shape of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> via the annular skeleton <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The size of the pocket cavity <b>301</b> of the receiving pocket <b>30</b> is configured to fit the predetermined amount of cushioning element <b>32</b>. In other words, in order to enhance the cushioning effect of the racket frame, the size of the pocket cavity <b>301</b> is increase to receive more amount of cushioning element <b>32</b>. It is appreciated that the cushioning element <b>32</b> can be integrally formed with the cushioning layer <b>312</b>. Therefore, the thickness of the cushioning layer <b>312</b> can be increased as integrating the cushioning element <b>32</b> with the cushioning layer <b>312</b> to enhance the cushioning effect of the racket frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the preferred embodiment, the racket frame further comprises an elongated racket handle <b>40</b> extended from the annular skeleton <b>20</b> through the receiving pocket <b>30</b>. Preferably, the racket handle <b>40</b> is coupled to the annular skeleton <b>20</b> via a handle connector <b>41</b>. In one embodiment, the handle connector, having a T-shape, has a skeleton connecting portion and a handle connecting portion. The skeleton connecting portion of the handle connector is connected to a portion of the annular skeleton. One end of the racket handle <b>40</b> is connected to the handle connecting portion of the handle connector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">It is appreciated that the racket handle <b>40</b> is detachably coupled to the handle connecting portion of the handle connector <b>41</b>. For example, the racket handle <b>40</b> has a threaded end and the skeleton connecting portion of the handle connector <b>41</b> has a threaded slot, wherein the threaded end of the racket handle <b>40</b> is rotatably and detachably coupled with the threaded slot of the skeleton connecting portion of the handle connector <b>41</b>. Therefore, the racket frame serves as a flying disc by detaching the racket handle <b>40</b> from the annular skeleton <b>20</b> and serves as a racket apparatus by attaching the racket handle <b>40</b> to the annular skeleton <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a waterproof racket according to a third embodiment illustrates a modification of the second embodiment, wherein the waterproof racket of the third embodiment has the same structural configuration except no cushioning element received in the outer sleeve <b>31</b>. Therefore, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is received in the outer sleeve <b>31</b> as shown in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate a modification of the waterproof racket according to the above first to third embodiment, which can selectively adjust the tension of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the annular skeleton <b>20</b> comprises a plurality of skeleton arms <b>21</b> and a plurality of adjustable connectors <b>22</b> that connect the skeleton arms <b>21</b> end-to-end to selectively adjust an annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. Accordingly, each of the skeleton arms <b>21</b> has two threaded end portions <b>211</b>, wherein each of the adjustable connectors <b>22</b> has two side threaded opening slots <b>221</b> rotatably coupled with the threaded end portions <b>211</b> of two of the skeleton arms <b>21</b>. Preferably, at least two skeleton arms <b>21</b> and two adjustable connectors <b>22</b> are provided to couple the skeleton arms <b>21</b> end-to-end to form the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. Therefore, when the adjustable connector <b>22</b> is rotated at one direction, the threaded end portions <b>211</b> of the skeleton arms <b>21</b> are moved away from each other to enlarge the annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. When the annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is enlarged, the receiving pocket <b>20</b> is stretched outwardly in a radial direction, such that the trampoline layer <b>10</b> is stretched correspondingly in a radial direction to increase the tension of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>. When the adjustable connector <b>22</b> is rotated at an opposite direction, the threaded end portions <b>211</b> of the skeleton arms <b>21</b> are moved toward from each other to reduce the annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. When the annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b> is reduced, the receiving pocket <b>20</b> has less stretch to reduce the tension of the trampoline layer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to allow the user to access the adjustable connectors <b>22</b>, the receiving pocket <b>20</b> further comprises a foldable leaf <b>33</b> affixed to the outer sleeve <b>31</b> at an opening slit thereof to selectively enclose the pocket cavity <b>301</b>. When the foldable leaf <b>33</b> is unfolded from the outer sleeve <b>31</b> to expose the pocket cavity <b>301</b>, the user is able to rotate the adjustable connectors <b>22</b> to selectively adjust the annular size of the annular skeleton <b>20</b>. When the foldable leaf <b>33</b> is folded on the outer sleeve <b>31</b>, the opening slit of the outer sleeve <b>31</b> is covered to enclose the adjustable connectors <b>22</b> within the pocket cavity <b>301</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, the present invention further provides a manufacturing method of the waterproof racket, which comprises the following steps.</div>
