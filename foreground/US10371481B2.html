<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of tactile reference features, and more particularly, to such features incorporated in objects that come into contact with a user whereby such features provide the user with tactile biofeedback.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The sports equipment handle, or interface between a piece of sports equipment and human skin, is perhaps the most overlooked and underappreciated piece of sports equipment, or interfaces, that can be improved for better performance. Sports equipment handle, and contact/interface, technology has changed very little over the past few decades. This is also true for virtually any interface between a user and another object, whether a sports equipment handle or not, and whether an interface located at the hand of a user and implicated via a grasping movement, referred to as a dynamic interface, or an interface elsewhere on the user, referred to as a static interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For the most part, the sports equipment handle and/or the contact interface has not been considered as a means for game improvement or performance enhancement. Rather, the sports industry has primarily focused on the impact head of a racquet or paddle, cue tip, materials of construction, aerodynamics, and projectile advancements as the sole means for helping improve an athlete's game. Many modern racquets, paddles, and bats are designed to be more forgiving when an athlete does not hit the ball in the sports equipment's sweet spot, or makes an errant throw. However, modern racquets, paddle heads, cue sticks, bat bodies, dart bodies, and archery/firearm designs do very little to help an athlete consistently hit the ball in the sports equipment's sweet spot or make consistent accurate shots or throws.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Interestingly, the sports industry, and most industries in general, has ignored the only physical connection between the user, or athlete, and the equipment, whether sports related or not (i.e., the sports equipment handle or contact interface in the case of balls, shoes, skates, socks, apparel, gloves, braces, and tapes) as a vehicle for improving the performance of a user, whether in an athletic activity, work activity, or leisure activity. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle and/or contact interface solves the problem by providing at least one tactile structure that harnesses the innate attributes and processes of the user's body.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In its most general configuration, the presently disclosed sport equipment handle, contact interface, and/or tactile attachment advances the state of the art with a variety of new capabilities and overcomes many of the shortcomings of prior devices in new and novel ways. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle, contact interface, and/or tactile attachment overcomes the shortcomings and limitations of the prior art in any of a number of generally effective configurations. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle, contact interface, and/or tactile attachment demonstrates such capabilities and overcomes many of the shortcomings of prior methods in new and novel ways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to an equipment handle (sports or non-sport), contact interface, and/or tactile attachment that provides a user with tactile biofeedback. The equipment handle may include a handle body having an upper portion, a lower portion, a handle length, a proximal end, a distal end, and an exterior body surface. The exterior body surface is defined by a first octant, a second octant, a third octant, a fourth octant, a fifth octant, a sixth octant, a seventh octant, and an eighth octant. The equipment handle, contact interface, and/or tactile attachment includes at least a tactile reference indentation or projection that extends longitudinally along a surface. The tactile reference indentation or projection is formed with dimensions specifically tailored to harness the user's natural attributes of sensibility, proprioception, and neuromuscular memory to enable the user to consistently hit a projectile with accuracy, throw or catch a projectile with accuracy, shoot a projectile with accuracy, or improve a user's ability to sense the location and placement of a body part.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">A sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) that provides a user with tactile biofeedback enables a significant advance in the state of the art. References to “sports equipment handle” throughout are applicable to non-sports equipment handles as well. Further, each aspect of the present disclosure applies equally to a contact interface, which includes any interface where the user's body comes into contact with a tactile reference feature, regardless of whether there may be a layer of material between the body and the reference feature, and regardless of such feature is built into a handle, or attached to, a handle, recess, glove, headwear, glasses, apparel, shoe, or any other object that contacts the user. The preferred embodiments of the device accomplish this by new and novel arrangements of elements and methods that are configured in unique and novel ways and which demonstrate previously unavailable but preferred and desirable capabilities. The detailed description set forth below in connection with the drawings is intended merely as a description of the presently preferred embodiments of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), and is not intended to represent the only form in which the present sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth the designs, functions, means, and methods of gripping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and features may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-61</figref> illustrate numerous embodiments of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and/or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) to provide a user with tactile biofeedback. The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and/or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) includes at least one tactile structure specifically tailored to exploit and harness the innate attributes and processes of the human body to allow the user to more accurately, and/or consistently, position a portion of their body in space, which may result in the more accurate hitting, throwing, shooting, dancing, and musculoskeletal sports performance and movement in general. It is worth noting at the outset of this section that all of the disclosure related to the tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>, <b>200</b> <i>a, </i> <b>200</b> <i>b, </i> <b>200</b> <i>c, </i> <b>200</b> <i>d</i>) and the tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>, <b>300</b> <i>a, </i> <b>300</b> <i>b</i>, <b>300</b> <i>c, </i> <b>300</b> <i>d</i>) applies to embodiments where the indentations or projections are formed in, or on, a piece of sports equipment, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-30</figref>, and also when the indentations or projections are formed in, or on, a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-61</figref>. Thus, all attributes disclosed with respect to embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> are also applicable to embodiments in which the indentations or projections are formed in, or on, a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-61</figref>, including, but not limited to, length, width, depth, height, wall and edge configurations, cross-sectional shape, placement, etc., and will not be repeated separately for tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) embodiments. Further, one skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments disclosing, and/or illustrating, a projection may alternatively have an indentation, and vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A), 1(B)</figref>, and <b>31</b>, an embodiment of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) on a baseball bat is illustrated. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) includes a handle body (<b>101</b>) having an upper portion (<b>102</b>), a lower portion (<b>103</b>), a handle length (<b>110</b>), a proximal end (<b>120</b>), a distal end (<b>130</b>), and an exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). The upper portion (<b>102</b>) and the lower portion (<b>103</b>) correspond to the portion of the handle body (<b>101</b>) that is above the midpoint of the handle length (<b>110</b>) and below the midpoint of the handle length (<b>110</b>), respectively. Generally, for a right-handed user using a conventional gripping style, the upper portion (<b>102</b>) is where a majority of the user's left hand would grasp the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and the lower portion (<b>103</b>) is where a majority of the user's right hand would grasp the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment the handle body (<b>101</b>) has a substantially circular cross-section throughout the handle length (<b>110</b>), however the present invention is not limited to circular handles. The exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) is defined by a first octant (<b>161</b>), a second octant (<b>162</b>), a third octant (<b>163</b>), a fourth octant (<b>164</b>), a fifth octant (<b>165</b>), a sixth octant (<b>166</b>), a seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and an eighth octant (<b>168</b>). The octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>) are defined by the intersection of four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>), with each vertical plane (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) spaced 45 degrees from the adjacent vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>), as seen well in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Preferably, the four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) intersect at the geometric center of the proximal end (<b>120</b>), i.e., the butt end, of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>); however the planes may be positioned to pass the a cross-sectional centroid of the handle. The four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) may be rotated about the geometric center of the proximal end (<b>120</b>) to define a position of the octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>). Moreover, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may include visual indicia, such as painted lines, on the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) that visually delineates the octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>). The tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4, 6, and 8</figref> have flat sidewalls and a flat bottom, but this is not necessary, and may be formed in the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) or may be formed in a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref> and disclosed later in great detail. The tactile reference indentation(s) may have a “V” shaped cross-section or even a curved bottom cross-section, it is more important that the surface edges of the tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) have very small, or no, radius of curvature so that the edges are very distinct. In one embodiment, radius of curvature from the indentation (<b>200</b>) sidewall to the adjacent handle, grip, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) surface is 0.35 millimeters or less. Such a dimension for the radius of curvature accommodates two-point discrimination by making the edge relatively fine and thus capable of distinction by feel. In another embodiment this radius of curvature is zero, meaning that the indentation and the adjacent handle, grip, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) surface, meet at a distinct line. In an even further embodiment, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the indentation (<b>200</b>) sidewalls meet the adjacent handle, grip, or tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) surface at substantially a 90 degree angle.</div>

The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to a first tactile octant selected from the group consisting of the first octant (<b>161</b>), the second octant (<b>162</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and the eighth octant (<b>168</b>).

It should be noted that while this particular embodiment includes “only” the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant, this does not mean that the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) cannot have additional surface patterns, texture changes, or other similar features. When the term “only” is used in connection with describing a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in certain tactile octants (i.e., “there is only the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in the first octant”), it means that the tactile octants do not contain any additional palpable indicia adjacent to the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>). The term palpable indicia, as used throughout this specification, means a structure having a depth or height of at least 0.4 millimeters, a width of at least 1.0 millimeters, and a length of at least 25 millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In another embodiment of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may include a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> (B) and <b>3</b>, and may be formed in the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) or may be formed in a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref>. The tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) has a tactile reference projection length (<b>310</b> <i>a</i>), tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), and a tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; and all of this disclosure applies equally to the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) embodiments seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-4646</figref> and the contact interface embodiments, including, but not limited to, configurations such as the interior of a shoe, skate, sock, glove, piece of apparel, recesses (including, but not limited to, bowling ball finger holes, prosthetic mounting recesses, and recesses/sleeves of any type in which a portion of the body is inserted including helmets and helmet liners), bearing surfaces (including, but not limited to, seats such as bicycle seats, motorcycle seats, automotive seats, airplane seats, wheelchair seats, and other surfaces designed to support a portion of the body while performing an activity) braces, tapes, and wraps. The tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to a first tactile octant selected from the group consisting of the first octant (<b>161</b>), the second octant (<b>162</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and the eighth octant (<b>168</b>). As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in this embodiment the first tactile octant is the second octant (<b>162</b>) and the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to the second octant (<b>162</b>). However, the first tactile octant may also be the first octant (<b>161</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), or the eighth octant (<b>168</b>). The tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5, 7, and 9</figref> have flat sidewalls and a flat top, but this is not necessary. The tactile reference projections may have virtually any cross-sectional shape provided that the outermost surface has two relatively well defined longitudinal edges. In other words, while the intersection of the sidewall surfaces to the adjacent handle, or grip, may be smooth and nondistinct, it is more important that the edges along the outermost surface of the tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) have very small, or no, radius of curvature so that the edges are very distinct. In one embodiment, radius of curvature from the projection (<b>300</b>) sidewall to the outermost surface of the projection (<b>300</b>) is 0.35 millimeters or less. Such a dimension for the radius of curvature accommodates two-point discrimination by making the edge relatively fine and thus capable of distinction by feel. In another embodiment this radius of curvature is zero, meaning that the projection and the adjacent projection sidewall meet at a distinct line. In an even further embodiment, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the projection (<b>300</b>) sidewalls meet the adjacent outermost surface at substantially a 90 degree angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In this particular embodiment, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is only the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Regardless of whether formed in the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-30</figref>, the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref>, or the contact interface embodiments, including, but not limited to, configurations such as the interior of a shoe, skate, sock, glove, piece of apparel, recesses (including, but not limited to, bowling ball finger holes, prosthetic mounting recesses, and recesses/sleeves of any type in which a portion of the body is inserted), braces, tapes, and wraps, the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) and the tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) are at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters, and the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) and tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) are at least 0.5 millimeters. These specific dimensions are important because they exploit several of the user's normal human body attributes to allow the user to more accurately, and/or consistently, position a portion of their body in space, which may result in the more accurate hitting, throwing, shooting, dancing, and movement in general; and enable the user to consistently grip a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and recognize the position of the handle in space, thereby improving a user's ability to hit, throw, or shoot a projectile with accuracy. The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and/or the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) enhances users' perception and awareness of the “spatial” relationship of the instrument attached to the handle (<b>100</b>), or a portion of the user's body, allowing for improved performance. These attributes include sensibility, proprioception, and neuromuscular memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Sensibility is the body's ability to determine fine objects by feel. This ability is measured by what is known as two-point discrimination. Two-point discrimination is defined as the ability to discern that two nearby objects touching the skin are truly two distinct points, not one. The test for two-point discrimination is usually performed utilizing two sharp points. Typically, a person has the most sensibility on their finger pads and lips. A normal measurement for two-point discrimination on the finger pads is a width of 2.0 millimeters to 5.0 millimeters, while other body parts, such as the back, have much larger measurements due to less nerve endings. When the two points are closer together than the range of two-point discrimination a person cannot tell whether they are being contacted by one point or two points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Proprioception is the unconscious perception of movement and spatial orientation arising from stimuli within the body itself. For humans, these stimuli are detected by nerves within the body, such as in joints, tendons, and muscles. A practical example of proprioception is the ability to close one's eyes and touch the index fingers of both hands together without looking. As a result of proprioception, the human body has the ability to know exactly where it is in space. The human body also has the ability to remember and repeat past movements, which are referred to as neuromuscular memory. As sensations are recorded by the body and movements are repeated over time, the body develops an ability to repeat movements without conscious effort.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">A user's connection to a piece of sports equipment is established by what they perceive at the point that they are griping the piece. The presently disclosed sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and/or the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), harnesses a user's sensibility by providing at least a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) to create an intimate connection between at least one of the user's hands and the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As previously mentioned, the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) and the tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters, regardless of whether formed in the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) or the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref>, which, importantly, corresponds to the normal range for two-point discrimination on the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm to provide the user with tactile biofeedback. Moreover, most humans do not have the ability to perceive a structure having a depth of less than 0.5 millimeters and a width of less than 2.0 millimeters with the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm. As a result, providing at least a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>), or the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), with a tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) of at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters and a tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) of at least 0.5 millimeters, which provides the highest level of sensibility, allows the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm to function as high level neurological information collectors. In a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is 2.0-4.0 millimeters and the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is 0.5-4.0 millimeters; while in an even further embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is 2.0-3.0 millimeters and the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is 0.5-3.0 millimeters. In still a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is at least twice the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>); while in yet another embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is at least three times the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>). In yet another embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 2-6 times the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>); while in yet another embodiment the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is 3-5 times the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>). In still a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is no more than the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). All ranges and relationships disclosed herein with respect to one tactile reference indentation or projection, are equally applicable to other disclosed indentations and projections but will not be repeated for the sake of brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The finger pads, thumb, and/or palm, as high level neurological information collectors, are able to recognize the location and orientation of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), which is in the same spatial relationship as the sports equipment handle. In sports in which the players typically wear gloves the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) may be increased to overcome the loss of sensitivity as a result of the glove layer. In one embodiment directed to gloved sports the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 1.0 millimeter, and more preferably at least 2.0 millimeters; while in a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is 1.0-4.0 millimeter, and more preferably 1.0-3.0 millimeters. Each of the disclosed ranges and relationships is critical to improved performance by aligning the characteristics of the indentations or projections with the high level discrimination on the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm to provide the user with tactile biofeedback and harness a user's sensibility to create an intimate connection between at least one of the user's hands and the piece of equipment with improved proprioception, thereby affording the user the ability to know exactly where the piece of equipment is in space. Due to the intimate connection and the high level of sensibility provided by the specifically tailored tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, or the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), the sports equipment becomes like an extension of the user's body. At this point, the user's natural ability of proprioception is engaged, which allows the user to unconsciously perceive and spontaneously direct the sports equipment's movement in space due to the high level of sensibility provided by tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As a result, the user will know where the sports equipment, which may include shoes and skates, is in space and can make conscious, or even unconscious, adjustments to ensure that the projectile is consistently hit, thrown, or shot with accuracy, or a portion of the user's body is positioned as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Additionally, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) build upon the beneficial attributes provided by the high level of sensibility and proprioception by utilizing the user's natural capacity for neuromuscular memory. When a user grasps the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), or engages the contact interface, and makes a swing, throw, or aligns to take a shot, the user obtains neuromuscular memory from the sensations recorded in the hands via the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), in addition to registering the entire body's spatial relationships through proprioception. This information is stored and fed back through the body to the hands so the various muscles and joints are able to repeat the recorded performance to be transferred to the sports equipment via the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), and in some embodiments the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>). As a result, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), and/or the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), allows the user to build neuromuscular memory to consistently strike, throw, or shoot a projectile with increased accuracy. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) provide heightened neurosensory input to facilitate proprioception and muscle memory. In orthopedic surgery it is generally recognized that the nerve endings in the tendons, muscles and joints are the receptors for transmitting information to the brain that influences proprioception. Proprioception is the innate ability of the human body to recognize where its body parts are in space. Further, the principle of tactile edge orientation processing (TEOP) shows that the nerve endings in the skin also participate in sending neurological impulses to brain that effect the human body's proprioception.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), contact interface, and/or the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), on a piece of sports equipment may be custom tailored to the end users specifications such that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) coincides with a pre-selected, user preferred, hand and finger placement on the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>); in fact, this is one of the key benefits of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) embodiments as will be explained in greater detail later, As such, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) additionally performs a “reminder” function. For example, the user will be able to feel the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) and know whether they are grasping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) with their preferred hand and finger placement, or properly engaging the contact interface. By knowing that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) coincides with the preferred placement of a body part such as the hand and finger placement and being able to tactilely perceive tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), the user will have a higher level of psychomotor confidence, which results in hitting, throwing, or shooting a projectile with better accuracy, and/or positioning a body part more accurately. In fact, when the user grasps the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), and/or the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), the skin of their fingers, thumb, and/or palm will minimally sink into the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>). As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a dermal imprint (<b>15</b>) is formed when grasping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and/or the surface of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>). The dermal imprint (<b>15</b>) provides a very subtle and precise psychomotor alignment “read” for the user at the microdermal neurosensory level, which ultimately leads to better movement, positioning, or aim, of the sports equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In one embodiment, the tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 50 percent of the handle length (<b>110</b>). Having a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) that extends along at least 50 percent of the handle length (<b>110</b>) accommodates the numerous styles of hand positioning and gripping used to grasp a piece of sports equipment. Such a tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>) maximizes the opportunity for the user's hands and fingers to come into contact with the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) to receive maximum psychomotor tactile biofeedback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, still another cross sectional embodiment of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) is shown, which one skilled in the art will recognize as applying equally to the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) embodiments seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref>. In this particular embodiment, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) further includes a second tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>b</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>b</i>) is confined to a second tactile octant selected from the group consisting of the first octant (<b>161</b>), the second octant (<b>162</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and the eighth octant (<b>168</b>) that does not include the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>). The second tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>b</i>) has a second tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>b</i>), a second tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>b</i>) of at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters, and a second tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>b</i>) of at least 0.5 millimeters. In this embodiment, there is a first tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) within the first tactile octant, and a second tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>b</i>) within the second tactile octant.

The discussion above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> will not be repeated here but merely referenced as applying to all the embodiments disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In one embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) located in the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) is preferably located within twenty-four inches of the ball-striking tip of the cue stick, and the length (<b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) is at least six inches. In another embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) located in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>) is preferably located within twenty-four inches of the butt-end of the cue stick, and the length (<b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) is at least six inches. A right handed player will typically grip the cue stick with the right hand in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>), while using their left hand to guide the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) of the cue stick throughout the stroke. In a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) extends majority of the length of the pool cue with no distinction between a separate indentation or projection in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>) or the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Generally professional pool players do not rotate the pool cue when making a stroke with the pool cue. However new players almost always rotate the pool cue one direction when pulling back to make a pool shot, and then rotate the pool cue back during the actual pool shot. Unfortunately, the rotation of the pool cue increases the likelihood of inaccurate shots. In addition to all the benefits discussed above, tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) and/or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) on a pool cue help the pool player become aware of any rotating motion during a pool shot, thereby resulting in a more accurate ball strikes. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and/or projection (<b>300</b>) allow the user to deliver the pool cue without rotation and in an exact preselected spot on the cue ball to create the direction and rotation desired. Further, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) in the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) provides the user with a greater sense of whether the stroke of the cue stick is in perfect alignment with the desired direction of ball travel, or if the stroke of the cue stick is cutting across the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The end of a pool cue is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>. The discussion of these figures will reference a pool cue end cap (<b>400</b>) as a separate attachment that may be applied to the end of a pool cue, however one skilled in the art will appreciate that the elements of the end cap (<b>400</b>), namely the pool cue tactile reference indentation (<b>500</b>) or pool cue tactile reference projection, and benefits afforded there from, may also be obtained by the elements being formed directly in the end of the pool cue and are hereby an embodiment of this invention. While separate drawings are not included for the pool cue tactile reference projection, by this point in the disclosure one skilled in the art will understand that the pool cue tactile reference indentation (<b>500</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref> may just as easily be a projection consistent with the other figures and disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Some pool players like to wrap a finger, fingers, or even the palm of the hand, around the end of the pool cue when making a shot. In this situation, the pool cue tactile reference indentation (<b>500</b>) or projection gives the player biofeedback regarding the position of the pool cue in the same manner discussed above with respect to other embodiments, thereby helping the player make better shots. The pool cue end cap (<b>400</b>) may have an end cap body (<b>401</b>) having an end cap proximal end (<b>420</b>), an end cap distal end (<b>430</b>), an end cap interior surface (<b>405</b>) and an end cap exterior surface (<b>410</b>). Additionally, the end cap (<b>400</b>) has a pool cue end cap interior aperture (<b>406</b>) located on the pool cue end cap distal end (<b>430</b>). Located on the end cap proximal end (<b>420</b>) is at least end cap tactile reference indentation (<b>500</b> <i>a</i>) or projection having an end cap tactile reference indentation length (<b>510</b> <i>a</i>); an end cap tactile reference indentation width (<b>520</b> <i>a</i>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>; and an end cap tactile reference indentation depth (<b>530</b> <i>a</i>) or height, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The pool cue end cap (<b>400</b>) is installed on a pool cue sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) by sliding the bottom section proximal end (<b>120</b> <i>b</i>) of sports equipment bottom section handle body (<b>101</b> <i>b</i>) inside of the pool cue end cap interior aperture (<b>406</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">When throwing a dart it is important that the dart player release the dart in a linear fashion without rotational or yaw movements.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 39</figref>, embodiments of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) on a firearm such as a rifle, shotgun, or cross-bow are illustrated. In this embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be located on the stock, the forestock, trigger, barrel, and/or the butt of the firearm, whether it is permanently formed in a portion of the equipment, or in the form of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) attached to the equipment. The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates both at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and projection (<b>300</b>) in the forestock of the firearm merely for simplicity and reduction of duplicative drawings. As with all the prior embodiments, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) of the firearm includes a handle body (<b>101</b>) having a handle length (<b>110</b>), a proximal end (<b>120</b>), a distal end (<b>130</b>), and an exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> does not specifically reference section lines <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, it is understood that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and/or projection (<b>300</b>) are consistent with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> and the disclosure above with respect to size, location, and quantity. Reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> is not limited to the circular handle embodiments illustrated and are referenced herein merely for illustration of the placement of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) with respect to the various octants of a handle. The principles apply regardless of the exterior cross-sectional shape of the handle and therefore the discussion above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> will not be repeated here but merely referenced as applying to all the embodiments disclosed herein. In this embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) on the forestock will only be contacted by a single hand and therefore the length is at least 25 millimeters. The forestock of the firearm may be divided into octants as disclosed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>. Further, as seen in FIGS, <b>29</b> and <b>39</b>, the butt of the firearm may include at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) in a manner as similar to that of the pool cue disclosed and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>. Such tactile reference features may be formed directly in the butt end of the stock or in a pad that is attached to the stock. The tactile references of the butt end will be felt on the bare shoulder, or through lightweight clothing, of the shooter. Such firearm tactile reference indentation or projection gives the shooter biofeedback regarding the position and orientation of the firearm in the same manner discussed above with respect to other embodiments, thereby helping the shooter properly position the firearm and make better shots. Another embodiment of the firearm butt tactile reference feature has at least two reference indentations or projections oriented 90 degrees from each other forming an “X” shape pattern as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the barrel of a firearm, or cross-bow, has a barrel axis, meaning the path that the projectile will pass within the barrel of the firearm when it is fired. Further, one skilled in the art will recognize that a firearm, whether it has a long barrel or a short barrel like a revolver or pistol, is generally intended to be upright when fired, meaning that a vertical plane passing through the barrel axis will contain the trigger. This is referred to as the design firing position. The vertical plane is then used to define a plane oriented 90 degrees to the vertical plane, which will be referred to as a horizontal plane, although whether it is truly horizontal depends on the orientation of the barrel axis is pitched upward or downward. Thus, the horizontal plane is one that is perpendicular to the vertical plane when in the design firing position and contains the barrel axis. Further, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) have a reference longitudinal axis, which is a line passing through a centroid of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) taken at every cross-section taken along the length of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>), which is easily understood by one of skill in the art with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>. While this description generally makes reference to the long barrel firearm illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the following frame of reference, nomenclature, and definitions apply equally to short barrel firearms such as the pistols and revolvers discussed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Now, with that frame of reference and nomenclature established, in one embodiment, such as the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the firearm has a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) with a reference longitudinal axis that never intersects the above defined horizontal plane. Thus, in this embodiment the reference longitudinal axis is not necessarily parallel to the barrel axis because the stock may be tapered, but a specific relationship is defined that improves the accuracy of the projectile due to the user's ability to better aim the barrel axis in light of tactile input the user receives from the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and preferably cannot be visually observed when firing so as not to cause distract from the sight or scope visual targeting. In another embodiment the relationship described in the prior two sentences is achieved with the use of a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) rather than a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>). Still further, in another embodiment the firearm has at least two tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>), or projections (<b>300</b>), each having a reference longitudinal axis that never intersects the above defined horizontal plane; which in a further embodiment are located on opposite sides of the barrel, and in yet a further embodiment are located equidistance from the barrel axis. Such embodiments facilitate both left and right handed users, as well as those that cut the stock and contact both tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>), or projections (<b>300</b>), at the same time. The disclosure of this paragraph applies also to the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), or projection (<b>300</b>), shown on tactile reference attachments (<b>700</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, and one skilled in the art will appreciate that these tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>), or projections (<b>300</b>), may also be permanently formed in the pistol grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In still a further embodiment described with respect to the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the firearm has a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) with a reference longitudinal axis that lies within the above defined vertical plane containing the barrel axis and the trigger. This is also true of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), or projection (<b>300</b>), shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> as tactile reference attachments (<b>700</b>) on the trigger or trigger guard. Thus, in these embodiments the reference longitudinal axis is not necessarily parallel to the barrel axis because the stock may be tapered, but a specific relationship is defined that improves the accuracy of the projectile due to the user's ability to better aim the barrel axis in light of tactile input the user receives from the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>), and preferably cannot be visually observed when firing so as not to cause distract from the sight or scope visual targeting. In another embodiment the relationship described in the prior two sentences is achieved with the use of a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) rather than a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>). An even further embodiment includes at least one tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>), or projections (<b>300</b>), having a reference longitudinal axis that never intersects the above defined horizontal plane, in addition to at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), projection (<b>300</b>), with a reference longitudinal axis that lies within the above defined vertical plane containing the barrel axis and the trigger.</div>

In an even further embodiment the tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>), shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> but easily understood with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, is at least 20% of the length of the barrel, it is at least 40% of the length of the barrel in another embodiment, is at least 5 times the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), while at least 10 times in a further embodiment, and at least 20 times in yet another embodiment, which in one embodiment is preferably at least 25 mm, and is at least 50 mm in still another embodiment; and likewise for embodiments having tactile reference projections and a tactile reference projection length (<b>310</b> <i>a</i>) seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>. In a preferred handgun firearm embodiment the tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projection length (<b>310</b> <i>a</i>) is 5-20 times the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), and is 7-16 times in another embodiment, and is 9-14 times in yet an even further embodiment. These relationships accommodates the numerous styles of hand positioning and gripping methods used to grasp firearm. Further the tactile reference indentation length, relationship to the width, and position maximize the opportunity for the user's hands and fingers to come into contact with the tactile reference indentation to receive maximum psychomotor tactile biofeedback and provide even more information for processing by the user's natural attributes of sensibility, proprioception, and neuromuscular memory to enable the user to more accurately shoot a projectile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">As previously touched upon, in some embodiments it is desired that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), or projection (<b>300</b>), cannot be visually observed when firing so as not to cause distract from the sight or scope visual targeting. Thus, in an embodiment the position of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), or projection (<b>300</b>), is such that a line perpendicular to the floor of the indentation, or the exteriormost surface of the projection, best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, also referred to as a normal, is oriented downward at an angle of at least 5 degrees. For example, the tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a, </i> <b>200</b> <i>b</i>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and projections (<b>300</b> <i>a, </i> <b>300</b> <i>b</i>), are oriented such that the above described normals are perfect horizontal because the tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a, </i> <b>200</b> <i>b</i>) and projections (<b>300</b> <i>a, </i> <b>300</b> <i>b</i>) are located at the 90 degree position and the 270 degree position. In a further embodiment the normal is oriented downward at an angle of at least 10 degrees, while in yet another embodiment it is oriented at 10-45 degrees, and 10-30 degrees in an even further embodiment. Such orientations also serve to enhance the safety of the firearm by encouraging placement of the fingers at the indentation(s) or projection(s), and thus away from the moving components of the firearm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30, 40, 41, 45, and 46</figref>, embodiments of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) on a pistol are illustrated. In these embodiments the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be located on the grip, barrel, trigger, or body of the firearm. The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates both at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and projection (<b>300</b>) on a single pistol grip, as well as a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) on the body, with a projection not shown but understood to be an embodiment, merely for simplicity and reduction of duplicative drawings. As with all the prior embodiments, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) of the pistol includes a handle body (<b>101</b>) having a handle length (<b>110</b>), a proximal end (<b>120</b>), a distal end (<b>130</b>), and an exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> does not specifically reference section lines <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, it is understood that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and/or projection (<b>300</b>) are consistent with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> and the disclosure above with respect to size, location, and quantity. Reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> is not limited to the circular handle embodiments illustrated and are referenced herein merely for illustration of the placement of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) with respect to the various octants of a handle. The principles apply regardless of the exterior cross-sectional shape of the handle and therefore the discussion above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> will not be repeated here but merely referenced as applying to all the embodiments disclosed herein. In an embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) on the pistol, whither permanently formed in a portion of the pistol or attached in the form of a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), has a length of at least 25 millimeters. Such pistol tactile reference indentation or projection gives the shooter biofeedback regarding the position and orientation of the firearm in the same manner discussed above with respect to other embodiments, thereby helping the shooter properly position the pistol and make better shots. An archery bow is held in front of a shooter in a fashion similar to that of a pistol. Therefore, one skilled in the art will appreciate that a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and/or projection (<b>300</b>) may be incorporated into the handle of a bow to provide the same benefits discussed throughout this application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be produced from a variety of materials. By way of example only, and not limitation, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be constructed of any conventional handle material, such as wood, metal, rubber, synthetic rubber, polymers, composites, and combinations thereof. The hardness of these types of materials is most commonly measured by the Shore (Durometer) test. Shore Hardness, using either the Shore A or Shore D scale, is the preferred method for rubbers/elastomers. The Shore A scale is used for “softer” rubbers while the Shore D scale is used for “harder” ones. The Shore hardness is measured with an apparatus known as a Durometer and consequently is also known as “Durometer hardness.” The hardness value is determined by the penetration of the Durometer indenter foot into the sample. The ASTM test method designation is ASTM D2240 00 and is generally used in North America. Related methods include ISO 7619 and ISO 868; DIN 53505; and JIS K 6301, which was discontinued and superceeded by JIS K 6253.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Some of the embodiments disclosed herein, including but not limited to badminton racquet handles, racquetball racquet handles, tennis racquet handles, cricket bat handles, cue sticks, and archery/firearms, the handles may be covered with a grip, often made of a softer leather or synthetic material applied to the handle. Such grips may incorporate the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and projection (<b>300</b>) disclosed herein. Thus, this disclosure concerning the size and location of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and projection (<b>300</b>) applies equally to grips that are then applied over the handles, as well as tactile reference attachments (<b>700</b>) applied to handles, grips, equipment, and even directly to the skin of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">As previously touched upon, the aforementioned tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) may be formed in any of the pieces of equipment listed herein, or may be attached to the equipment via a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) having at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-46</figref>. Similarly, the aforementioned tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) may be formed in any article of apparel, or may be attached to the apparel via a tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>); and for the purposes of this application the term apparel includes devices enclosing at least a portion of the head (including helmets and helmet liners), neck, hands, and feet (including all type of shoes and boots). A glove apparel embodiment is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47-56</figref>, whereby a tactile reference indentation or at least one tactile reference projection may be formed in any one of the fingers, preferably positioned in the positions disclosed for the apertures in U.S. Ser. No. 16/106,184 titled “sensitivity enhancement glove,” the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) is located so that majority of it is at, or distal to, the distal interphalangeal joint (<b>1000</b>), seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>. A shoe apparel embodiment is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-58</figref>, and a sock apparel embodiment is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) includes a primary substrate (<b>710</b>) containing the at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-44, 60</figref>(A), and <b>60</b>(B). A benefit of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) embodiments is that the user may precisely position the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), and therefore one or more tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), on a piece of equipment, an article of apparel, or directly on the skin of a user, wherever desired. This allows a user to test many different locations and configurations to determine that which provides the greatest performance benefit for them, thereby eliminating the expense of multiple pieces of custom product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In embodiments directed to non-swinging, or throwing, equipment, the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) may consist of only a primary substrate (<b>710</b>) having the at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>). In such embodiments the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) is not subjected to significant forces when gripped by the user and therefore may stay in place and provide the described benefits when in the form of a static cling decal, having the disclosed indentation or projection attributes, that can easily be applied, removed, and reapplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-44, 60</figref>(A), and <b>60</b>(B), the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) includes a primary substrate (<b>710</b>), which may be flexible or rigid. The primary substrate (<b>710</b>) has a primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>), a primary substrate length (<b>714</b>), and a primary substrate width (<b>716</b>). The primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is at least 25% greater than the first tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is at least 25% greater than the first tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>), while in a further embodiment it is at least 33% greater than the first tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or it is at least 33% greater than the first tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>), and in yet an even further embodiment it is at least 50% greater than the first tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or it is at least 50% greater than the first tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>). Another series of embodiments caps the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) so as to not negatively influence the performance of the equipment or become distracting to the user. In one such embodiment the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is less than twice the first tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or first tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>). Additionally, a relationship of the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) in relation to the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), is important to ensure the tactile perception of the indentation or projection is not negatively influenced by the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>). In one such embodiment the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is no more than twice the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is no more than twice the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>); while in another embodiment it is no more than 50% greater than the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or it is no more than 50% greater than the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>); and in still a further embodiment it is no greater than the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or it is no greater than the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). However, durability may become an issue when primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is significantly less than the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), thereby becoming a tear strip. Thus, in one particularly durable embodiment the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is at least 25% of the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is at least 25% of the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), while in another embodiment it is at least 40% of the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or it is at least 40% of the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), and in yet a further embodiment it is at least 55% of the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or it is at least 55% of the first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). In one specific embodiment the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is no greater than 4.0 mm, while in another embodiment it is no greater than 3.0 mm, in yet another embodiment it is 0.75-2.5 mm, while in an even further embodiment it is 1.0-2.0 mm. In one embodiment the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is formed integrally with the primary substrate (<b>710</b>), while in another embodiment the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is attached to, or inserted into, the primary substrate (<b>710</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments the primary substrate width (<b>716</b>), seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, is such that the edges of the at least one tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), are separated from an edge of the primary substrate (<b>710</b>) by an edge clearance distance that is at least as great as the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), to ensure that the user is sensing the indentation or projection, and not an edge of the primary substrate (<b>710</b>). In a further embodiment the edge clearance distance is at least 50% greater than the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). While in even further embodiments this goal is achieve by varying the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) so that at the perimeter edges of the primary substrate (<b>710</b>) the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) is reduced to less than 0.5 mm, thereby making the edges unperceivable to the average human fingers; thus in a further embodiment the primary substrate thickness (<b>712</b>) changes by at least 50% from the perimeter edges to the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). The stability of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) and its ability to maintain a straight tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), despite repeated gripping or contact with the user's fingers, is improved in embodiments having an aspect ratio of the primary substrate length (<b>714</b>) to the primary substrate width (<b>716</b>) that is at least 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) may also include an adhesive (<b>720</b>), as well as a release liner (<b>730</b>). The adhesive (<b>720</b>) may a permanent adhesive or a multi-use adhesive so that the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) may be repeatedly attached and removed from a piece of equipment, or used on multiple pieces of equipment. The release liner (<b>730</b>) may protect the adhesive (<b>720</b>) until the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) is about to be attached to a piece of equipment, apparel, or directly to the user. In the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-44</figref> the adhesive (<b>720</b>) is on the side of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) that is opposite the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>); however in embodiments in which the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) is attached directly to the body of the user, the adhesive (<b>720</b>) is on the same side as the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), as would be the case of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60(A) and 60(B)</figref> which represent the incorporation of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) into kinesiology tape to be applied directly to the skin of a user. Thus, in one such embodiment the primary substrate (<b>710</b>) is formed of a highly elastic, breathable, water resistant, and skin friendly material, which in one particular embodiment consists of at least 50% cotton, and at least 75% cotton in another embodiment, and at least 90% cotton in still a further embodiment. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) may be formed of the same material as the primary substrate (<b>710</b>), or it may be formed of a different material. In one particular embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) are formed of, or in, material that has an elastic modulus (E) and a shear modulus (G) that is at least twice that of the material forming the primary substrate (<b>710</b>), while in a further embodiment they are at least 4 times, and at least 8 times in still another embodiment. These same relationships disclosed with respect to the primary substrate (<b>710</b>) and the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) apply equally to the apparel embodiments with the properties of the apparel material being substituted for that of the primary substrate (<b>710</b>). In one specific embodiment the primary substrate (<b>710</b>) has non-linear elastic properties and is a porous composite material; which in a further embodiment is a core-spun elastic yarn; and in still a further embodiment the tensile strength is 80-180 N. In yet another embodiment the 100% Young's modulus value is 2-8 MPa. In one embodiment the maximum elongation (%) is no more than 170%, while in another embodiment it is 65-150%, while in still a further embodiment it is 100-140%. In an embodiment the adhesive is an acrylic adhesive. In one embodiment the maximum elongation (%) of the material forming the and the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 10% less than that of the material forming the primary substrate (<b>710</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In a further embodiment majority of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) has a rough surface with an average roughness (Sa) value of 15-125 μm. In still a further embodiment the rough surface does not extend to an edge of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>); in fact in one embodiment the rough surface does not get within a smooth region dimension of an edge of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), and the smooth region dimension is at least as great as the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>). In a further embodiment the smooth region dimension is at least as great as twice the first tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), or first tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Some embodiments of the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) contain only a single tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), per tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. Conversely, in other embodiments the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>), such as the one seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, incorporate multiple tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), per tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>). Embodiments such as that seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> are beneficial in that the tactile reference attachment (<b>700</b>) controls the spacing and relative orientation of the multiple tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>), or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), so as to avoid conflicting feedback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The palm side of the human hand has a durometer value ranging from approximately 25 to approximately 35 Shore A on the hardness scale. In yet another embodiment, the durometer of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and/or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) is at least 70 percent greater than the durometer value of the palm side of the human hand. Thus, in one embodiment the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and/or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) has a durometer value greater than 60 Shore A on the hardness scale to ensure that the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and/or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) is significantly harder than the portion of the human hand, and therefore the tactile reference indentation and/or projection is even more perceivable. In an even further embodiment the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) has a durometer value of at least 65 Shore A on the hardness scale to ensure that the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) is significantly harder than the portion of the human hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Thus, one skilled in the art will appreciate that an even further embodiment consists of at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) that may be applied to the handle of a preexisting piece of sports equipment. For instance, one embodiment may incorporate a kit of one or more one tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) that may be adhered to the handle of an ordinary piece of sports equipment. For example, a user may apply a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) to the handle of a standard baseball bat, or any other piece of sports equipment, to determine if the addition of the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) improves their ball striking, throwing, or shooting. Alternatively, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be formed in the handle of piece of sports equipment utilizing traditional handle manufacturing processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In the case of a grip applied over a handle, or a nonmetallic handle, the grip, handle, or tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be made of rubber, synthetic rubber or polymers, which may be produced by injection molding or extrusion molding. Often conventional handle molding techniques are limited in their ability to produce a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) having a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) with distinct sharp edges, i.e., zero radius edges. Therefore, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be formed by a molding process followed by a CNC machining process. Additionally, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be produced by an advanced compression molding process, laser cutting, or a water jet. Furthermore, a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) that is made out of wood, metal, or composites, and combinations thereof may be formed by CNC machining, laser cutting, and or water jet cutting to form the basic shape of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and any tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) found thereon.</div>
