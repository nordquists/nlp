<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Tool grips and handles may be enhanced by the addition of modular inserts which compensate for two voids in the human hand. A first insert may fill a void in the palm of the hand while a second may fill one by the fingers. By filling the voids, a more natural, relaxed, and customizable grip may be achieved for almost any handle. Use of a plurality of inserts allows for customization according to hand size while the size of the inserts also accounts for the size, dimensions, and axes of the handle and tool in general. Meniscus-shaped inserts may be stacked on one another for optimum effect.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority as a continuation-in-part application based on prior filed U.S. application Ser. No. 15/709,016, now abandoned, which was in turn a non-provisional perfection of prior filed U.S. Application No. 62/396,572, filed Sep. 19, 2016. Both applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of hand grips and more particularly relates to a system to modify existing grips to better comport with the anatomy of a hand.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">It stands to reason that when using a hand tool, there must be a portion of the tool, a grip, for the user to grasp with the user's hand. Designs for grips vary according to the type of tool, preferences of the user, additional functionality, etc. In more modern times, ergonomics, the science of how the human body interacts with and uses its surroundings, including tools, has become of utmost importance. Proper ergonomic design has been shown to reduce injuries from repetitive motion. This science includes any interaction of human and tool, and would include a hand with a grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Many tools and sporting equipment, such as rackets and paddles for various sports, are notoriously non-ergonomic. Usually these grips, or handles, are no more than a stick extending from the wired frame. The handle is generally made of planar sides with no accommodation for the natural gaps formed in a user's hands. As a result, players of these sports tend to over compensate by gripping the handle around the index finger and thumb with too much force (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), leading to repetitive strain injuries such as tennis or golfer's elbow. The handle construction described is not limited to rackets, as similar construction is found on baseball bats and golf clubs (which tend to be conical), and many other tools.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is a modular grip enhancement system which endeavors to properly support a user's hand anatomy and prevent the excessive gripping pressure caused by planar or conical handles or grips. The modular grip enhancement system is applicable to any type of handle or grip and is customizable for the hand geometry of the user and the geometry of the grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention represents a departure from the prior art in that the modular grip enhancement system of the present invention allows for more dynamic ergonomic interaction between user and grip areas along multiple axes, while being modifiable to accommodate the various and size of hand and handle grip style by the user.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of tool grips, this invention provides a modular grip enhancement system. As such, the present invention's general purpose is to provide a new and improved grip enhancement system that utilizes multiple interchangeable parts so as to adapt a given handle to a user's hand. To accomplish these objectives, the grip enhancement system comprises at least one forward and at least one rearward component. All components may be temporarily mounted upon a grip so that a user may use the grip with the enhancement modules in place before permanently affixing the enhancement modules. The modules are designed to support two gaps in the grasping hand: one by the juncture of the two middle fingers with the palm and one cavity in the center of the palm itself. Different shapes and sizes accommodate multiple users and multiple existing handles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The more important features of the invention have thus been outlined in order that the more detailed description that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may better be appreciated. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter and will form the subject matter of the claims that follow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Many objects of this invention will appear from the following description and appended claims, reference being made to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification wherein like reference characters designate corresponding parts in the several views.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference now to the drawings, a preferred embodiment of modular grip enhancements is herein described. It should be noted that the articles “a”, “an”, and “the”, as used in this specification, include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the human hand <b>10</b> has two voids when forced around a cylindrical or conical grip. These two voids are approximated by grip inserts <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. Grip insert <b>110</b> is intended to fill a cavity in the palm of the hand while insert <b>120</b> is located proximate the middle <b>115</b> and ring <b>117</b> fingers. Ideally, the second insert <b>120</b> will help the fingers maintain a natural arc <b>30</b> for a more relaxed grip experience. Without the inserts (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), the hand <b>10</b> may grasp a handle <b>20</b>, but the lack of support causes overcompensation in the index finger <b>113</b> and thumb <b>110</b> and by the pinky <b>119</b>. The hand <b>10</b> essentially collapses on the grip <b>20</b>. The overcompensation then may lead to repetitive stress injuries, such as tendonitis in the forearm and elbow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Use of the modular grip enhancement inserts (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) provide multiaxial, multi-point support to the hand by filling the cavities in the palm and by the fingers. Use of the first insert <b>110</b> compensates for the over gripping caused by the thumb <b>111</b> and index finger <b>113</b> while the second insert allows a natural contoured contact for the middle <b>115</b> and ring <b>117</b> fingers. This natural contoured contact allows these fingers to adequately grip the handle <b>20</b> and distribute the force necessary to control the tool along all five fingers. The contoured contact also registers the tool handle <b>20</b> with the hand <b>10</b> such that the tool will always be in the same position relative the hand <b>10</b>. This then provides consistency in the use of the tool, which can be of great importance when the tool is some form of sports equipment or some other tool where such consistency is desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In use (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), at least two inserts <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are provided, one for the palm cavity and one for the finger cavity, which are generally opposite each other. Providing a set of inserts with at least two different sizes and or shapes for each insert allows for them to be tried out for optimum performance and relocated or exchanged if needed. In the preferred embodiment, at least one additional set of alternate inserts, <b>115</b>, <b>125</b>, should also be provided to compensate for different hand <b>10</b> and handle <b>20</b> sizes and geometries. Two, or possibly more, differently-sized inserts can be used to account for different palm and finger sizes and relative distances, and also accommodate different tool handles. Multiple inserts of the same shape and size may also be provided in such a set, as two identical inserts could also be used as the first and second inserts (note that inserts <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> are approximately the same size). Inserts <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> should be applied to the grip/handle <b>20</b> by a temporary adhesive and the tool used to determine proper fit. Inserts <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may then be moved or switched with alternate inserts <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> as needed. Once proper fit is established, the inserts may then be made a permanent part of the handle <b>20</b>, such as permanent adhesives, grip tape, or other securement methods. A single piece with two bulbous bodies would have less adaptability and customization, though could still function as a less ideal module.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Of particular note is the ability of the inserts to create multi-axial grip possibilities. It should be noted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> that each insert (<b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>) is shaped similarly to a meniscus lens, featuring a concave inner surface which nests with the convex outer surface of either the handle <b>30</b> or other inserts. The meniscus shape can be generally described as a positive meniscus, having a thicker middle than the edges, though there may be occasions where a negative meniscus shape would be beneficial. For the preferred embodiment, the convex outer surface has a greater curvature than the concave inner surface. This feature, combined with the inherent flexibility of the inserts themselves, allows the inserts to nest on each other. Each insert may be angled in a fashion to offset a natural major or minor axis of the handle <b>30</b>. This is shown in further detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>. As can be seen in these figures, a round handle <b>20</b> has two inserts <b>120</b>, <b>125</b> stacked on its circumference, defining an axis X where the insert's (or inserts' as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) combined maximum width W resides on the handle. Alternately, a second axis Y could also be defined, providing initial support as with the first X axis but diverting the axis as a whole. This axis Y would also be defined by the point of maximum width W′ of the two inserts combined, but this would be offset as the second insert is likewise offset from the first. Still further, a third axis Z may be defined by adding yet another insert <b>125</b> over the existing two and creating another point of maximum width W″. In this manner, an infinite series of axis may be defined and utilized by a user. While this is not well seen with a round example, there may be non-symmetrical features on the tool, club, paddle, etc. which would make the definition of such an axis advantageous. These axes may either enhance or reduce the natural axes of non-round handles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Inserts may be made of any suitable material, with molded polymers being preferred. Polymer durometer may be selected to provide a balance of cushioning and support. An inter-webbed understructure may be provided to reduce weight while maintaining physical integrity. Shapes of each insert may be varied for the type of grip (straight or conical) and for various hand shapes. Multiple inserts may be designed to co-operatively fill one void. Inserts may be identical to each other, or not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, numerous modifications and variations can be made and still the result will come within the scope of the invention. No limitation with respect to the specific embodiments disclosed herein is intended or should be inferred.</div>
