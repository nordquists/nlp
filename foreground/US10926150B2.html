<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA435518666">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A sports training/exercise apparatus attached to a swinging sports apparatus, typically a racquet and most specifically a tennis racquet. The apparatus includes a drag chute with a rigid member disposed therearound and a clamp secured to each side of the drag chute. A transverse support rod is positioned between the clamps and includes an aperture therein. The apparatus further includes brackets at the top and bottom of the racquet head. A longitudinal support rod is positioned between the brackets and extends through the aperture in the transverse support rod. Thus, the transverse support rod, the side clamps, and the drag chute are slidable along the longitudinal support rod to adjust resistance. A locking mechanism can be used to lock the transverse support rod in a position along the longitudinal support rod.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/559,100, entitled “Tennis Training Apparatus,” filed on Sep. 15, 2017, by the same inventors; and is tangentially related to U.S. Nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 15/683,311, entitled “Baseball Training Device”, filed on Aug. 22, 2017, by the same inventors; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates, generally, to sports exercise equipment. More specifically, it relates to a device that exercises muscles and improves performance in sports that require swinging an apparatus, e.g., racquet sports such as tennis, badminton, squash, and racquetball, among others.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Sports training devices are known in the art for aiding in the swinging motion of a piece of sporting equipment, such as a baseball bat. However, they fail to teach or suggest a mechanism that allows a range of motion with adjustable resistance levels, without becoming entangled around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racquet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of such training devices are CN100518867C, CN203001843U, JP2013233193A, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,183,526, 5,186,699, 5,501,451, 5,897,469, 7,384,344, 9,259,636, 9,539,482, 9,555,303, 9,662,524, US20040063519A1, US20060009314A1, US20100234146A1, US20100331125A1, US20140113752A1, and U520140243170A1. As can be seen in the conventional art, there are multiple training apparatuses for different swinging sports devices for providing resistance during a swing of the swinging sports device. However, when referring specifically to racquet sports, primarily tennis, there are no known methodologies for affixing a panel/chute/airfoil at a spaced distance away from the face of the racquet. For this reason, most training devices for racquet sports simply wrap the racquet head in a stretchable fabric. A disadvantage of this mechanism is the inability to adjust resistance and the inability to strike a ball while using the training device since the racquet face/strings are covered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Collectively, previous devices have allowed for swing resistance; however, these devices must utilize a static air foil or risk becoming entangled around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racquet, and they only offer a single level of resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, what is needed is an improved racquet sports training device that provides an adjustable air resistance for training, regardless of their skill level or need. However, in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the field of this invention how the shortcomings of the prior art could be overcome.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term “or” is generally employed in its sense including “and/or” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, the current invention is a swinging sports exercise and training device designed for attachment to the shaft of a swinging sports apparatus, such as a racquet (tennis, badminton, squash, racquetball, paddle ball, etc.). The invention will be described and illustrated herein as applied to a tennis racquet, but it can be understood how the device can be applied to other racquet sports apparatuses as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Particular examples of the training device can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B and 2A-2H</figref>. As shown in the figures, the training device generally includes a drag chute and at least two connection points to the racquet. It is contemplated that the training device can be coupled to the racquet at a single connection point, such as to the strings at the center of the racquet. In any case, a spaced distance exists between the racquet strings and the drag chute. The drag chute is positioned only on one side of the racquet head, such that the drag chute trails behind the racquet during a swing of the racquet. Alternatively, it is contemplated herein that the training device can also be used in front of the racquet and/or on both sides of the racquet. The drag chute typically has a circular or ovular shape to match the shape of the racquet head, so that the chute experiences all of the air/wind flowing through the racquet strings during a swing of the racquet head. However, it can be understood that the drag chute can take any shape or form. Further, the drag chute can be formed of any suitable material, such as a lightweight and flexible fabric or canvas, a plastic film or sheet, a carbon fiber sheet, aluminum, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The drag chute may further include a rigid member disposed along the edges of the canvas. If the drag chute takes a circular/ovular shape, then the rigid member can be disposed around the circumference of the canvas, as can be seen in the figures. If the drag chute takes another shape, such as a rectangle or trapezoid as seen in U.S. Pat. No. 9,662,524, then multiple rigid members can be used and disposed along select edges of the canvas. The rigid member(s) is used to stabilize the drag chute during a swing of the racquet. Alternatively, it is contemplated herein that if a more rigid chute material is used (e.g., plastic sheet, carbon fiber, aluminum, or other similar material is used), a rigid member may not be needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed, the device has at least two connection points on the racquet, one of which is disposed at one end/portion of the racquet head and the other of which is disposed at an opposite end/portion of the racquet head. For example, one connection point can be at a proximal end/portion of the racquet head, and the other connection point can be at a distal end/portion of the racquet head, where the connection points are diametrically opposed to each other. The term “proximal.” is used herein to refer to a relative position of a structural component being closer to a user of the underlying swinging sports apparatus. The term “distal” is used herein to refer to a relative position of a structural component being further from the user of the underlying swinging sports apparatus. The distal connection point typically is disposed near one end of the corresponding component or underlying device, and the proximal connection point typically is disposed near an opposite end of the corresponding component or underlying device. As another example, the connection points can be disposed at the left and right sides of the racquet head, where the connection points are also diametrically opposed to each other. It can be understood that rather than the connection points being exactly “diametrically opposed” to each other, the connection points can be generally opposed to each other on one side of the racquet head. Yet another embodiment can include more than two connection points spaced apart around the frame of the racquet head. These general configurations will become clearer as this specification continues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Structurally, these connection points can be formed between the annular/ovular frame of the racquet head and a coupling mechanism secured to the drag chute. Examples of such a coupling mechanism include, but are not limited to, pipe clips, snap clamps, clasps, hasps, catches, hooks, buckles or any other suitable mechanism that can be used to accomplish the function and structural configuration described herein. This coupling mechanism typically has a diameter or inner dimension that is larger than a width or outer dimension of the racquet frame. As such, the coupling mechanism of the training device can be easily connected to the frame of the racquet by positioning the coupling mechanism around the racquet frame. An example of the coupling mechanism taking the form of a clip can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, the coupling mechanism can take the form of a bracket, such as an L- or U-shaped bracket, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B and 2A-2H</figref>. The following description will discuss these brackets secured at the distal/top and proximal/bottom ends of the racquet head, but it can be understood that the positioning of the brackets on the racquet head can vary according to the needs of the user. Typically, however, the brackets are positioned on opposite ends of the racquet head, so that the drag chute is stabilized when trailing the racquet head during a swing of the racquet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">When the training device is installed on the racquet, in order to couple the distal end of the racquet to the training device, the upper/distal bracket coupling mechanism extends from the distal end of the drag chute (creating the spaced distance between the chute and racquet strings), through a gap in the racquet strings, and upward/distally beyond the top/distal edge of the racquet head. Similarly, the lower/proximal bracket coupling mechanism extends from the proximal end of the drag chute (creating the spaced distance between the chute and racquet strings), through a gap in the racquet strings, and downward/proximally beyond the bottom/proximal edge of the racquet head. Through this structure, the racquet is securely coupled to the training device, such that the training device will remain in place on the racquet during a swing thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">It is understood herein that not all racquets have the same head size, either in length or width, though most head sizes are between about 85 in<sup>2 </sup>and about 135 in<sup>2</sup>, with most of these being between about 95 in<sup>2 </sup>and about 110 in<sup>2</sup>. Thus, if the brackets can have a distance between them of about twelve (12) inches or more, then this distance would be larger than a vast majority of racquet head lengths. In this scenario, to install the training device on the racquet head, the distance between the brackets would need to be decreased for example by compressing the lower bracket toward the upper bracket (or vice versa) This compression can be achieved by utilizing a coil spring that is biased toward a position of expansion. When the spring is compressed, the lower bracket can move toward the upper bracket until the bracket can be inserted through a gap in the racquet strings and be secured to the racquet frame. Further, the upper bracket would be similarly positioned at the distal end of the racquet frame. In this case, the upper bracket would exert an upward force on an inner surface of the distal racquet head frame, and the lower bracket would exert a downward force on an inner surface of the proximal racquet head frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">It can be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the general mechanism of fitting the training device to various-sized racquet heads can be accomplished in a variety of manners. For example, rather than the distance between the brackets being larger than the maximum length of a racquet head, the distance can be smaller than the minimum length of a racquet head, and a coil spring biased toward compression can be used to expand the distance between the brackets. A clip or other mechanism can then be used to secure the training device to the racquet frame, where forces are exerted inwardly on the outer surfaces of the racquet frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The training device may further include a longitudinal support rod disposed between the upper and lower coupling mechanisms. The longitudinal support rod may also be directly connected to the upper and lower coupling mechanisms to maintain the distance therebetween and to maintain stability of the chute during a swing of the racquet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The figures depict the previously-discussed spring on the exterior of the proximal end of the longitudinal support rod. In other embodiments, the spring can be positioned within an interior of the support rod (not shown). In this case, two rods would be disposed along the training device, rather than just one. The rods would include a smaller rod/tube and a larger rod/tube, where the spring would fit inside the larger tube. The smaller tube would then be inserted into the larger tube and would contact the spring. The spring can then perform the same function as discussed previously but would be internally located, so as to not be exposed to the external environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the current invention provides for adjustable resistance experienced by a user swinging the racquet. In this case, the upper and lower coupling mechanisms may not be attached to the drag chute at all. Rather, the training device may further include a transverse support rod extending between two opposing sides of the drag chute, where the transverse support rod is disposed substantially parallel to the longitudinal support rod. The transverse support rod is secured to the drag chute on each side using transverse coupling mechanisms; this can be accomplished in any suitable manner, for example clamps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">To provide adjustability of resistance, the transverse coupling mechanisms, the transverse support rod, and the drag chute are slidable along the longitudinal support rod in the direction indicated by the arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref>, while the upper and lower coupling mechanisms and the longitudinal support rod remain stationary and affixed to the racquet. The slidability of the transverse rod and drag chute can be accomplished in any suitable manner, for example interlocking flanges and channels. Another example is rather than a transverse support rod being present, a second longitudinal support rod (not shown) is present and attached to the drag chute, where the second longitudinal support rod is parallel to, in communication with, and slides along the affixed support rod.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Yet another example, depicted in the figures, is an aperture disposed within the transverse support rod with the longitudinal support rod extending therethrough, such that the transverse rod can slide up and down the length of the longitudinal support rod. In this way, the transverse coupling mechanisms, the transverse support rod, and the drag chute slide in unison along the longitudinal support rod. It should be noted that as the drag chute (along with the transverse support rod) moves distally, including beyond the distal end of the racquet head, drag resistance experienced by the user increases. As the drag chute (along with the transverse support rod) moves proximally, including beyond the proximal end of the racquet head, drag resistance experienced by the user decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Although resistance is adjustable, a user may wish for the resistance to be fixed while swinging the racquet or otherwise during a practice session. Any suitable mechanism can be used to secure or lock the transverse support rod in place, thus also locking the drag chute in place. When the transverse support rod is not slidable along the longitudinal support rod, it is fixed in place and the training device can be used. When the transverse support rod is unsecured or unlocked from the longitudinal support rod, it can slide along the longitudinal support rod until the desired resistance is set, at which point it can be locked again. As shown in the figures, a locking knob/pin can be used to lock and unlock the transverse support rod.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the training device may include two drag chutes, one position directly behind the other. One chute is stationary on the racquet, and the other is adjustable up and down the racquet. This configuration provides a benefit of further increased resistance, if desired.</div>
