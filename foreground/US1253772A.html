<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 2 is a perspective View of a missile constructed in accordance with the present invention g Fig. 3 is a face view of a racket as shown in Fig. 1, the game counters thereon being shown as set at zero or the starting position; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 4 is a vertical section of the missile shown in Fig. 2, the section being taken as on the median line thereof. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Description As seen in the drawings, the missile 9 is shaped as a disk and has in the under side a recess 10. Extended from the upper periphery of the missile is a series of feathers 11. The feathers 11 operate to partially suspend the missile 9 when falling through the air and to maintain the missile in an upright position While so falling. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The racket 12 is constructed of thin nonrcsilient material and has a flat surface adapted to fit the annular edge 13 of the missile 9 to close the entrance to the space or pocket formed of the recess 10. When the racket is disposed to properly receive the missile 9, the air is partially driven from the recess 10 immediately prior to and at the time of the missile striking the surface of the racket. A slight rarefaction of the air in the recess 10 is thereby produced Which Specification of Letters Patent. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">On the surface of the racketl).L and preferably adjacent the handle lithereof are counters 15 and 16. Thecounters 15 and 16 are each supplied witha pointer 17. The pointers 17 are pivotally mounted on the racket 12 and concentric with thel counters 15 and 16 by means of pins 18. The friction between the surfaces of ine racket and pointers 17 is sufficient to hold the pointers stationary when either of the contestants using the racket is playing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">. With a racket and missile constructed as disclosed, the game is played as follows: The pointers 17 are initially disposed at the zero point as shown in Fig. 3 of the drawings. One of the contestants is provided with a racket 12. The missile 9 is placed thereon and is tossed in the air by the contestant using the racket to a sufficient height according to the rules or provisions of the game or contest. When the missile falls the contestant catches the same, exercising care or skill to receive the missile in parallel relation to the' face of the racket. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The missile is again and again tossed in the air and caught, count being kept of the total number of successful catches. This is continued until by chance or awkwardness the missile is permitted to strike unevenly on the racket in which case it will fall there from interrupting the continuation of the play The pointer 17 on one of the markers 15 and 16, as the case may bc, is moved to show the total number of successful operations by the contestant surrendering the racket. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The second contestant then puts the mis sile in play and endeavors to excel in number the successful tosses and catches previously accorded to the opposite contesta-nt. Then the second contestant fails, his count is accorded on the remaining counter, and the game proceeds by turning the racket over to the iirst operating contestant who resumes and adds to the total of his count. By a pre-arrangement the gaine is won by the person first acquiring a certain number of successful tosses and catches. </div>
