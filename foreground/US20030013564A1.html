</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0002" num="0002">This invention relates to structures known as bats, racquets or paddles (hereinafter, “paddles”) for use in ball games. It specifically relates to paddles for use in table tennis or ping-pong games. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">In most racquet sports, particularly table tennis and ping pong (hereinafter collectively referred to as “table tennis”), the paddle consists of a flat paddle surface (“blade”) of varying shape attached to, and in the same plane of, a handle. As a result of this single plane configuration, any effort to strike a ball so it moves in any direction other than in a perpendicular plane to the player's body requires the player to twist or bend his or her wrist in proportion to the angle of ball movement which is desired. <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005">In addition, the player's movements are constrained by the need to either rotate the paddle up to 180 degrees or more around the player's body, or to change the hands holding the paddle, to allow a backhand shot to be made. <span style="display: none">[0005] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006">To explain, as opposed to the forehand side of the body, the backhand side is considered to be the one opposite the hand holding the paddle when the player is at rest. Similarly, the backhand side of the paddle is (as opposed to the forehand) that side which faces in the opposite direction of the palm of the hand which holds the paddle. To change play from forehand to backhand, therefore, the paddle must be fully rotated around the player's body from its forehand to its backhand side. Not only is this required rotation somewhat awkward to achieve it also causes the player to lose much of the time available to address the ball to positioning the paddle for play. <span style="display: none">[0006] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0007" num="0007">Further, the traditional table tennis paddle consists of a substantially cylindrical handle immovably attached to the paddle blade. Except for the possible presence on the handle of cushioning means (such as compressible foam), the handle does not conform structurally to the player's hand. As a result, it is most commonly gripped by allowing the hand to encompass the handle, (a shake hand grip), leaving the paddle in a substantially perpendicular position with respect to the player's wrist. As a result, the most comfortable paddle position is not the one best suited for play, thus encouraging fatigue of the player's wrist and hand. A different grip (called the pen holder grip), is sometimes used. The cylindrical handle is held like one would grip a pen for writing. This puts the face of the paddle in a downward position allowing the backhand face of the blade to be the only surface used for striking the ball. <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0008" num="0008">About 25 years ago, a paddle was designed with a straight handle attached to the lower surface of a blade. The handle was angled downward and outward at such an extreme angle, that one could hold it with the shake hand grip and the blade would remain in a substantially downward position. This allowed the player to strike the ball in the same manner as using the pen holder grip on a conventional paddle. Because of the extreme angle, only the backhand side of the paddle could be used. This style of play is very restrictive and some strokes are very difficult to perform. <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0009" num="0009">What is needed, therefore, is a paddle for racquet sports, and particularly for table tennis, which allows the player to comfortably make both forehand, backhand and angled strokes with minimal adjustment of the paddle position, and which allows the player a more secure grip of the handle. <span style="display: none">[0009] </span> </div>
</li> <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0010" num="0010">In essence, the paddle of this invention consists of two principal structural components, which are either formed separately and joined or molded as a single piece. These components are the blade and handle. <span style="display: none">[0010] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0011" num="0011">In the embodiment described, the attachment of the handle to the blade must include the following points: <span style="display: none">[0011] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0012" num="0012">(1) The center line plane of the handle and the plane of the blade are two separate but intersecting planes at 90° to each other?<span style="display: none">[0012] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0013" num="0013">Thus, the paddle is symmetrical and can be played with either the right or left hand. <span style="display: none">[0013] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0014" num="0014">(2) The handle contained within its plane is rotated outward and, downward , in an arc, from the single attachment to the blade at an angle between 0° and 60°. The angled handle allows the blade of the paddle to be an extension of the arm rather than perpendicular to the wrist as is normal with conventional paddles. When held using the shake hand grip, this new paddle configuration has a top and bottom blade surface as opposed to the conventional paddle, which has two vertical blade surfaces. <span style="display: none">[0014] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0015" num="0015">(3) The attachment of the blade to the top surface of the handle does allow for a larger unobstructed surface on the topside of the paddle. However, the playing surface, of the blade, extends only forward from the terminal end attachment line of the handle with the blade. The area above and to each side of the attachment to the handle is where the player's thumb rests for best control of the paddle. <span style="display: none">[0015] </span> </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0019" num="0019">FIG. 1 depicts one embodiment of the invention in a side view. In this embodiment, blade <span style="display: none">[0019]</span> <b>1</b> and handle <b>2</b> are separate components. Handle <b>2</b> is rotated outward and downward, in an arc, wherein the single leg <b>3</b> is attached by attachment means to the under side face <b>5</b> of blade <b>1</b> along one edge thereof. The center line plane containing handle <b>2</b> and the underside face <b>5</b> of blade <b>1</b> are two separate, but intersecting planes at 90° to each other. The handle <b>2</b> contained within its plane is rotated outward and downward from the attachment <b>3</b> to blade <b>1</b> at an angle between 0° and 60°. This angle is formed by the chord line, which connects attachment point <b>6</b> and the end of the top curve <b>7</b> of handle <b>2</b> before rounding to connect to the lower curve <b>9</b> of the handle. </div>

The blade is designed for maximum stability and ease of play The attachment of blade <span style="display: none">[0020]</span> <b>1</b> to the top surface <b>3</b> of the handle does allow for a larger unobstructed surface on the topside <b>10</b> of the paddle. However, the playing surface, on both sides <b>5</b> and <b>10</b> of blade <b>1</b>, extends only forward from the terminal end attachment line <b>4</b>. The area behind the terminal attachment line <b>4</b> is where the player's thumb rests for best control of the paddle. </div>

The handle has two curvatures <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> along the gripping surface to conform, respectively, to the index finger of the player's hand (with the thumb resting on the top surface of the paddle behind the terminal attachment line <b>4</b>), while the second curvature <b>9</b> accommodates the remaining fingers of the player's hand. The extension <b>11</b> between two of the fingers stabilizes the handle and prevents it from sliding out of position while being held onto lightly. </div>
