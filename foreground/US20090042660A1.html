</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Performance-enhancing handles are employed in various demanding applications including golf clubs, baseball bats, tennis rackets, ping pong paddles, badminton rackets, and hockey sticks. Such applications often demand handles and accompanying grips that facilitate gripping and maximize performance for a particular stroke or application.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For the purposes of the present discussion, a handle may be any structure that facilitates manual leverage. A grip may be any surface or accompanying shape or set of contours adapted for use with a handle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">High performance handles and accompanying grips are particularly important in golf applications, which demand precise striking of relatively small balls. A conventional golf club handle includes a substantially cylindrical shaft covered with a textured gripping surface, such as leather or vinyl. The handle enables a user to wrap fingers of both hands around the shaft.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Various alternative grips and handles are often employed to enhance golf club gripability. Unfortunately, such grips are often not allowed during tournament play, but instead are used for training. As illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 412,479 to C. A. Davis, 5,984,795 to Joseph W. Stafford, and 5,299,802 to Jean Bouchet-Lassale, alternative grips may include various contours and handle protrusions to increase hand or finger leverage and/or grip. Such handles and grips often require all fingers to wrap or bend around the grip or handle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The thumb, which is often called the first finger or the first digit, is the only digit that can readily oppose or turn back against the other fingers. The opposability of the thumb facilitates grasping objects, such as grips and handles, between the thumb and the fingers. To facilitate gripability, grips are often designed to maximize the ability of the thumb to flex and oppose forces imparted to the grips by the other fingers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Grips that maximize opposability of the thumb often recruit various muscles and nerves of the hand and forearm, which control thumb movement and opposability. Hand muscles that control thumb movement include the abductor pollicis brevis, the flexor pollicis brevis, and the opponens pollicis, which are controlled by the median nerve. Forearm muscles that control thumb movement include the extensor pollicis longus, the abductor pollicis longus, the flexor pollicis longus, and the extensor pollicis brevis, which are controlled by the posterior interosseous nerve or the anterior interosseous nerve.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The index finger is often used to oppose thumb motion. Grips are often designed to recruit the index finger and its accompanying muscles and nerves, including the flexor indicis, the extensor digitorum communis, and the extensor indicis porprius.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Unfortunately, such grips and accompanying handles for maximizing gripability and involvement of various muscles, tendons, and nerves of the hands and forearm, often exhibit heretofore unrecognized shortcomings in certain applications, such as golf, where involvement of certain muscles, tendons, and nerves may be undesirable.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain embodiments of the present invention disclose a handle that includes grip structure for accommodating a hand. The grip structure includes a first mechanism that is coupled to the grip structure for reducing involvement of a thumb of a hand in grasping the grip. A second mechanism is coupled to the grip structure and reduces involvement of an additional digit of the hand in grasping the grip.</div>

The additional digit includes an index finger, a middle finger, and/or a ring finger of the hand. The involvement of a thumb includes involvement of muscles and tendons coupled to the thumb.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The novel design of certain embodiments disclosed herein is facilitated by use of a grip structure that selectively decouples certain muscles, tendons, and nerves of the hand and forearm that are ordinarily used to control thumb and finger movement. Such embodiments may enhance relaxation of the hands and forearm involved in griping the grip, thereby improving performance of accompanying sports equipment and facilitating training. Unlike various embodiments discussed herein, conventional grips and handles often teach away from reducing the grip, leverage, or involvement of one or more digits of a hand.</div>

A left thumb <b>38</b> rests against the shaft <b>18</b> and is positioned adjacent thereto. The right hand <b>42</b> is positioned above the left hand <b>40</b> so that a right middle finger <b>44</b> and a right ring finger <b>46</b> are bent around the handle shaft <b>18</b> so that the tips of the of the right middle finger <b>44</b> and ring finger <b>46</b> are adjacent to the left thumb.

The right thumb <b>14</b> is cradled by the thumb protrusion <b>24</b>, which holds the right thumb <b>14</b> in an approximately strait orientation.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">For the purposes of the present discussion, a digit of a hand is said to be in a substantially strait orientation if the distal, intermediate, and proximal phalanges or bones associated with the digit are approximately aligned. In such an orientation, knuckles associated with the digit are said to be mostly unbent. A digit of a hand may be any finger or thumb of a hand. The thumb is often called the first digit; the index finger the second digit; the middle finger the third digit; the ring finger the fourth digit; and the little finger the fifth digit.</div>

For example, in certain applications, the handle shaft <b>18</b> is longer and enables the left hand <b>40</b> and the right hand <b>42</b> to be separated so that the right little finger <b>48</b> does not overlap the left index finger <b>30</b>.

Unlike the grip structure <b>24</b> disclosed herein, conventional grips are often designed to maximize the ability or tendency of the thumb to flex and oppose force provided by the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, and/or the little finger on a grip or handle.</div>

For example, a thumb, such as the right thumb <b>14</b>, is controlled by various muscles and nerves of an accompanying forearm, such as a right forearm <b>50</b>. The hand muscles include the abductor pollicis brevis, the flexor pollicis brevis, and the opponens pollicis, which are controlled by the median nerve. Forearm muscles include the extensor pollicis longus, the abductor pollicis longus, the flexor pollicis longus, and the extensor pollicis brevis, which are controlled by the posterior interosseous nerve or the anterior interosseous nerve. Similarly, muscles used to control an index finger, such as the right index finger <b>16</b>, include the flexor indicis, the extensor digitorum communis, and the extensor indicis porprius.</div>
