<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a racket grip aid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">A table tenths is one of the famous sports in the world, which is popular in the region and country of the number as many as a football, judo, and so on. The table tennis game places a table between players who hit a ball facing each other and try to get a point to win, using the ball made of celluloid. The game is divided into 3 kinds, singles, doubles, and group game, and players are required to make full use of the overall technological and physical abilities including dynamic vision, reflexes, instantaneous force and endurance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">A table is 274.5 cm√ó152.5 cm, and a ball is 40 mm (diameter). Instantaneous control for those of ball course, speed, spin, and timing is required, and it is necessary to speed up the racket swing to increase the ball speed, turning the body and moving the center of gravity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">In the table tenths game, players ascertain the ball direction, speed, and rotation in a short time, concentrate and adjust the ability of each body part and hit the ball, by the surface or back of the racket, making adjustment of angle, dealing with the ball direction and power from an opponent. Although each body part can fully be used by a skilled player, a beginner is unable to make the best use of the body power on the impact, and it takes a time to be the skilled player.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, the kind of table tenths racket is divided into, a penfolder type and a shakehand type, which differ in grasping the racket grip. In case of the shakehand type, a rubber is put on the back, as well as the surface of racket. As for the penholder, the player usually hits a ball by the surface of racket, and recently the number of penholder player with the rubber on the back of racket, is increasing, to hit the ball by backhand, besides hitting the ball by forehand.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">For handling the shakehand racket, as the player holds the racket grip by the middle finger, third finger, and little finger, and puts the racket board between the thumb and the index finger, there should be no big difference for the racket swing by forehand or backhand. However, the change of racket surface and the adjustment of racket angle, must be made very quickly and appropriately to strongly respond to the ball, and its backhand stroke may give the player much more burden than that of forehand for the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, and then it is advisable to use an appropriate tool to lower the burden to avoid a health problem.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, it is determined if a ball comes to the forehand side (right side in case of right-handed person), or to the backhand side (left side in case of right-handed person), or to the front, in light of the opponent player's action, a course of flying ball, and a position of ball touched on the table, and the player returns the ball, trying utmost to eliminate a mistake. In this case, there are many elements to practice including such factors as the performance and the characteristic of racket/rubber, posture and body ability, at the time of hitting the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">At present, in case of the forehand stroke, the shakehand racket player leans the racket surface to left (for the right-handed person), using the thumb and the index finger which put the racket board in between, and for the backhand stroke, the player leans the racket surface to right (for the right-handed person). In any case, the load of thumb is heavy and may cause a healthy problem with the wrist, elbow, shoulder.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Originally the thumb and the index finger hold a racket to swing like drawing an arc (by forehand or backhand), as well as such other fingers as the middle finger, third finger, and little finger to grasp the racket grip. The adjustment of racket angle is made principally by the thumb or by thumb and index finger, and part of it can be made by others to reduce the load of thumb.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Looking for a way to substitute for the role of outward rotation operation which is mainly made by the thumb at present, inventor of the present invention aimed at the function of middle finger, and tried to let it work for promoting outward rotation operation on the backhand stroke, to adjust the angle of the racket surface and reduce the load of wrist, elbow and shoulder, and send a strong ball to the opponent.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">In the racket swing of both forehand and backhand, it is necessary to respond to the flying ball from the opponent, turning the racket face and making a precise adjustment of racket angle, and advantages of using this racket grip aid of the present invention can be applied to both forehand and backhand strokes. The role of third finger and little finger is not same as the middle finger, in this case. However, there will be a case to have the fingerhold of third finger function as a supplementary role.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">In any situation of the table tennis game, a common concern is to reduce a mistake, and invite opponent's error, and then it is necessary to quickly make the switching of the surface and adjust the racket angle, to appropriately respond to a flying ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">Though the racket grip may be partly modified, a bold modification is not practical in terms of its lower profile of the shakehand racket, and much improvement in the aspect of feeling and grip condition of hand can not be expected. Therefore, it is advisable to use some tool and realize the valid racket grip condition which fits player's hand.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Under such circumstances to cope with the above-mentioned task, the inventor recognized importance of the inward and outward rotation operations, and ascertained that the present invention is able to naturally contribute to the improvement of racket swing, making the best use of this grip aid, as a result of attempt aiming at the functions of the thumb, middle finger and index finger.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">In consideration of the above-mentioned matter, the present invention intended to provide the racket grip aid to make it possible that the player appropriately makes the change of racket surface, adjusting an angle, and quickly and strongly responds to an opponent. Then, it must be possible to quickly tilt the racket surface and strongly hit a ball, giving a forward rotation to the ball. If the ball flew to the unanticipated place and the player was forced to return the ball momentarily, the racket surface tends to become inappropriate, and the ball may rise or exceed from the table, or may give a chance ball to smash by the opponent. However, the racket angle can be appropriately adjusted, by using the grip aid of the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">Also, the grip aid of the present invention is useful, for the penholder players, too. It does not use the middle finger, and reduces the load of thumb playing the main role for both of inward rotation and outward rotation operations.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">A part of the penholder grip to hang the thumb and the index finger is usually cut down to easily hold the grip and shift the position to hold. Generally, for the backhand stroke by the penholder racket, it is made by pressing the neighborhood of the racket grip which is held by the index finger to the back side (right side in case of right-handed person), and shifting the position of thumb to the front edge of the racket board and pushing to the back side which tilts the racket to right (in case of right-handed person). It requires a practical experience, and the backhand stroke is not easy for a beginner, and its countermeasure is not provided, at present.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The grip part of penholder racket can be cut boldly if necessary. However, in considering the feeling of the grip condition, its extreme modification is not realistic, and it is advisable to use some tool, which matches the hand and reduces the load to the wrist, arm, and shoulder.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention corresponds to the above-mentioned situation and the problem, as mentioned below.</div>
