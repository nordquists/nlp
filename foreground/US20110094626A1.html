<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional patent Application No. 61/279,890, filed on Oct. 27, 2009.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention disclosed and claimed herein deals with novel sports articles that are manufactured from Acetylated wood. It further deals with a method of manufacturing such articles from acetylated wood.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been found that sports articles manufactured from such wood provides sports articles that are durable and do not break under normal use conditions as is common with bats and hockey sticks and the like.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In many sports activities, there are certain articles that need to be employed to play the sport. Such activities, for example, include baseball and softball in which bats are used to hit the balls. Other such sports are tennis and lacrosse that use rackets and ice hockey that uses hockey stick. Also contemplated within the scope of this invention are table tennis paddles, badminton racquets, and cricket paddles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, these articles are made from wood or from plastic where the rules of the sport allow. However, both of these forms of the articles are subject to breakage and it is common to observe, for example, a baseball player swing at a pitched ball and break the bat when contact is made between the bat and the ball. This breakage is dangerous ranging from portions of the broken bat hitting players or fans, to sharp pieces of the broken bat piercing the players hands and arms.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">There is currently a new wood that is available that is wood that has been treated by a process of acetylation which provides the wood with durability, dimensional stability, enhanced hardness, and resistance to moisture contamination.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">This process is the subject of a International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2009/000268, that was filed on Jan. 30, 2009.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors therein discovered that certain ordinary woods (not all woods are capable of being so-treated) can be treated by a process of acetylation in which wood having a certain moisture content is submerged in a vessel containing an acetylation fluid, at a certain temperature, and pressurizing the fluid and wood. Woods that are known as being capable of treatment in this manner include, but are not limited to, radiata pine, alder, soft maple, European beech and the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Thereafter, excess acylation fluid is removed from the treating vessel and an inert fluid is introduced which causes an exotherm of the wood and fluid. Thereafter, the fluid and wood are heated a second time to cause another exotherm and then the wood is removed from the fluid and allowed to cool.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventors herein have found that such wood can be manufactured to provide sports articles as set forth Supra, that have exceptional properties, among which, is a capability of being used in sports activities without breaking.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the invention herein consists of a wooden sports article manufactured from acetylated wood. In another embodiment, there is a process of manufacturing wooden sports articles from acetylated wood.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">As mentioned Supra, any sports article that is currently made from plastic or wood can be duplicated by using acetylated wood as it have been discovered that such wood can be shaped on conventional mechanical equipment.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">The process for making the sports articles comprises providing billets of suitable hardwood and then kiln drying them to the required moisture content for the acetylation process to occur optimally. The kilned billets are then processed in the acetylation chambers according to the patented process. Once completed, the billets are then appropriately shaped as required for a particular article and then finished.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, ball bats are turned on lathes to the appropriate shape and then finished with a finish material and allowed to dry.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, with more specificity, the process for manufacturing a sports article comprises providing wood billets of a predetermined size and drying the billets to a moisture content suitable for an acetylation process as described in the aforementioned PCT application.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Acetylating the wood billets according to the acetylation Process and then drying the wood billets and thereafter, shaping the wood billets according to a predetermined shape into a predetermined sports article.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The final step is applying finishes to the shaped sports article and then allowing the finishes to dry.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">The nominal size of the billets for use herein are those that will result in the desired size and shape of the sport article desired. For example, billets of 3 inches√ó3 inches, by 38 inches is suitable for a bat.</div>
