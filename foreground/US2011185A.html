<div class="description-paragraph">MaCutchan, Bloomfield, N. J., assignors to Table Tennis Corp. of America, N. J., a corporation of New Jersey Union City, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Application June 6,1334, Serial No. 729,170 2 Claims. (Cl. 273-76) This invention relates to an improvement in bats or paddles used in playing the game referred to as table tennis and by other names, andthe object of the invention is to improve the bat structure, making it more durable and substantial, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and also improving the design so that the bat isy more easily grasped and held during the playing of the game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Some of the defects possessed by bats or paddles of the kind under consideration are that the bats warp, the coverings or facings on the bats loosen, and the handles are often so shaped that the bat must be uncomfortably held during playing of the game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Our invention seeks to remedy the defects above `pointed out and to make the bat substantial, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">strong and comfortable to grasp and hold during play. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object of the invention is to provide means for causing the facing to tenaciously attach to the faces of the bat so that the possibility of the facing becoming loosened or detached during the normal life of the bat willbe very remote. These and other objects are attained by the invention, a more particular description of which will appear hereinafter.y </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the accompanying drawing, wherein an embodiment of the invention is shown, Fig. 1 is a perspective View of the improved bat or paddle showing the manner in which it is grasped in the hand during play; Fig. 2 is a front elevation of the bat, with a part of the covering or facing being broken away; Fig. 3 is an edge View of the bat; Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic view` showing how the body of the bat is pitted byknurling rollers` to insure firm adhesive attachment of the facings and handle sections with the body portion of the bat; and Fig. 5 is an enlarged sectional view through the body of the paddle Withthe facing adhesively attached to one side thereof. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the accompanying drawing, 6 indicates the body portion of the bat, the same being preferably `composed of a laminated section of at wood or other suitable sheet material. The body portion is preferably built up of several layers or laminations to form, as far as possible, a non-warping The body portion is provided with a projecting handle part 1, said handle part being integrally formed with the resfjl of the body portion. After the body portion has been cut to shape, both of its faces8 and 9, including the opposite faces of l the handle portion 1, are roughened, pitted, or recessed in any suitable Way, such as by passing the entire body portion between knurling rollers III and II, `as diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 4. After the body,` portion passes between these rollers, both of its faces are roughened, pitted or knurledto form a plurality of miniature recesses or pockets I2, shown in detail in Fig. 5. `The facings I3 are then adhesively applied to both faces 8 and 9 of faces 3 and 9 of the bat, they will adhere thereto indefinitely due` to their tenacious adherence with the pitted faces 8 and 9 of the body portion. The handle is formed by adhesively uniting two `shaped handle sections I5 and I6 With the opposite pitted faces of the handle portion 'I on the body of the bat. A very firm adhesive engagement of these handle sections I5 and I6 with the body of the bat is readily attained with the pitted Vsurfaces of the handle part 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> At its upper end, each of the handle sections I5 and I6 is formed with a concavely curved, tapered surface I1, as clearly shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It will be there seen that these surfaces Il extend on a continuously concavely curved line without curvature interruption` or change, to meet the opposite faces of the bat, so that the ngers may seat in these curved recesses and extend out on the faces of the bat without feeling the pressure of any protruding parts of the handle. In playing the game, the bat is held substantially as shown in Fig. 1, where it will be seen that the thumb of the hand fits in and rests against one of the curved, tapered surfaces' I'I, while the index finger of the hand fits in and rests against the curved surface II on the opposite side of the bat. The curved and tapered surfaces I 'I are so shaped that they closely follow the curvature of the fingers, so that the bat may be comfortably and firmly held without cramping the fingers or irnposing the pressure of flat surfaces, angular edges or protruding handle parts on thengers of the hand. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The method of making the bat is such that theV bat may be easily made and assembled by machinery and the resultant device is a substantial, lasting accessory capable of hard use without destruction. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">What we claim is: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. A bat of the character described having a body portion, handle sections secured to the opposite faces of the body portion, the upper without change of curvature, the tapered portions of the handle sections being thus curved to form concave recesses for the ngers positioned on opposite sides of thefbat when the bat is held in playing position. i </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. A bat of the character described'having a body portion formed with an integral projecting handle part of the same thickness as the body portion, handle sections of greater thickness than the handle part secured to the opposite faces thereof and co-operating therewith to form a relatively thick rounded handle, said handle sections having their upper ends tapered on concavely curved surfaces to form finger-engaging recesses on opposite sides of the bat, said curved portions extending on a continuously curved surface to meet the opposite faces of the bat Without change of curvature, said curved portions cooperating with the faces of the bat to form unbroken, concave finger engaging surfaces. </div>
