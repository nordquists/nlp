<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to table tennis, also commonly referred to as ping-pong, and, more particularly, to a new and useful table tennis paddle for use in playing table tennis.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The sport of table tennis or ping-ping, as it is commonly referred to, is most analogous to tennis. While table tennis is scored differently than tennis, the general objective is the same. That is, the goal of table tennis is to strike a ball, using a racket or paddle, over a net and passed the opponent. The equipment required to play table tennis is generally a paddle, a table tennis ball, a table, and a net stretched across the middle of the table.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">While a relatively young sport, table tennis has rapidly increased in popularity around the world, especially in the United States. Essential to one's success in table tennis is the paddle used by the player. Moreover, with the growing popularity of table tennis, there is a need for a paddle that makes the game of table tennis easier to play and, more specifically, that provides better control of the ball during play. Traditional paddles commonly comprise a single layer, flat panel or blade that is fixed to a handle. This configuration often results in a rigid paddle with a small “sweet spot,” therefore, resulting in more erratic shots by the user and less control over the ball.</div>

The blade comprises a first layer, a second layer coupled to the first layer, a third layer coupled to the second layer, a fourth layer coupled to the third layer, and a fifth layer coupled to the fourth layer. The blade preferably comprises a first outer surface on one side of the blade and a second outer surface on the opposing side of the blade, whereby at least one playing surface or face of the paddle is coupled to the first outer surface, the second outer surface or both surfaces. Preferably, the playing surface(s) are customizable and/or replaceable and may be constructed from any one of the following materials: sandpaper, rubber, sponge, carbon fiber, sand, diamond dust, plastic, and the like. It should be appreciated that the playing surface(s) or face may be constructed from any material without limiting the scope of the present invention. Moreover, the head is generally in the shape of an oval and at its longest section (from the tip of the blade to the top of the handle) is approximately 7 inches long and at its widest section is 6.5 inches wide. Preferably, the blade further comprises two curvatures that extend from the head and into the handle. The handle preferably comprises two gripping members coupled to opposing sides of the handle, each gripping member having a proximal end located in close proximity to the blade and an opposing distal end.

However, techniques, systems, and operating structures in accordance with the invention may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and modes, some of which may be quite different from those in the disclosed embodiment. Consequently, the specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely representative, yet in that regard, they are deemed to afford the best embodiment for purposes of disclosure and to provide a basis for the claims herein, which define the scope of the invention. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It should also be noted that the words “racket” and “paddle” may be used interchangeably throughout. Finally, it should be noted that the words “user” and “player” may be used interchangeably throughout.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">The paddle of the present invention is generally to be used for the sport of table tennis (sometimes referred to as ping-pong). However, it should be understood and appreciated that all of the disclosed features and designs can be implemented into any paddle or racket used for any sport requiring a paddle or racket, without limiting the scope of the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041">The paddle of the present invention provides several features and serves many purposes. For example, the table tennis paddle of the present invention makes it easier and more exciting for all players. As another example, the paddle of the present invention makes it significantly easier for beginners to learn to play table tennis and carry on a game or rally, and provides advanced, expert, and/or intermediate players with the ability to have longer rallies and hit harder shots with increased control.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042">The paddle of the present invention has a specific design type, which will be discussed thoroughly with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> below that makes it perform differently than other paddles.</div>

As will be discussed below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each layer is constructed from a particular material, which serves to create a strong and durable, yet flexible paddle. Moreover, each layer of blade <b>102</b> preferably comprises a head or head portion <b>104</b> and a handle or handle portion <b>106</b> that extends from head portion <b>104</b>. Again, it should be understand that head portion <b>104</b> and handle portion <b>106</b> of each layer may be two separate pieces that are coupled together, without limiting the scope of the present invention. Head portion <b>104</b> is generally an oval shape and handle portion <b>106</b>, which extends from head portion <b>104</b>, is generally rectangular in shape and is generally narrower than head portion <b>104</b>. Blade <b>102</b> further contains playing surface or face <b>108</b>, which is preferably coupled to the outer surface (not shown) of blade <b>102</b>. Blade <b>102</b> preferably comprises a second outer surface (not shown) and a second playing surface or face (not shown) coupled to the second outer surface (not shown) on the opposing side of blade <b>102</b>.
