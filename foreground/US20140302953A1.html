Weather resistant table tennis racquets are particularly suitable for use with table tennis tables that are used outdoors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">An object of the present invention is to provide embodiments of a table tennis racquet and a method of producing table tennis racquets, especially a weather resistant table tennis racquet, of robust quality, a variety of playability features, and/or with a visually appealing look and structure. Further, embodiments of a method for producing table tennis racquets are described. Embodiments of the methods may be carried out particularly effectively and inexpensively.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the invention, embodiments of a method for producing a table tennis racquets comprises producing a plate-shaped base body in a first injection molding process, coating the plate-shaped base body on a first playing surface side with a first polymeric material in a third injection molding process, and coating the plate-shaped base body on a second playing surface side opposite the first playing surface side with a second polymeric material in a fourth injection molding process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Further according to the invention, embodiments of a table tennis racquet comprising a plate-shaped base body, a first playing surface consisting of a first injection molded plastic on a first side of the base body and a second playing surface consisting of a second injection molded plastic on a second side of the base body, wherein the second side is opposite of the first side on the base body. In certain embodiments, the color of the first injection molded plastic is different than a color of the second injection molded plastic.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment of the method of producing a table tennis racquet, a plate-shaped base body is produced. Subsequently, in a further process step, the plate-shaped base body is at least partially coated on a first side with a first polymeric material, such as a plastic, to produce a first playing surface. In a further process step, the plate-shaped base body is at least partially coated on a second side with a second polymeric material, such as a plastic, producing a second playing surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least one embodiment, the table tennis racquet comprises a first playing surface having a first color and the second playing surface having a second color, wherein the first color of the first playing surface is different than the color of the second playing surface. In embodiments, where the first color is different that the second color, the table tennis racquet has a visually appealing appearance. In further embodiments, the first polymeric material is different than the second polymeric material in at least one chemical or physical property. For example, one of the playing surfaces may comprise a polymeric material that is softer and/or more pliable than the polymeric material of the other playing surface. In still further embodiments, the first playing surface and the second playing surface may have distinct structures, so that they also have distinct game playing properties. For example, one of the playing surfaces may be relatively smooth, while the other playing surface comprises structures, for example, knobs or pips. In other embodiments, the first playing surface comprises different structures than the second playing surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In other embodiments, after the production of the base body and before the application of the playing surfaces, the method comprises attaching a handle to the base body in a second injection molding process. In additional embodiments, attaching the handle may occur after coating one or both playing surfaces on the base body. A base body attached to a handle without playing surfaces attached is typically referred to as a blade in table tennis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, producing the base body and/or attaching the handle and/or the coating with the playing surfaces are performed by plastic injection molding process. In a more particular embodiment, producing the base body, attaching the handle, and at least partially coating the base body with the playing surfaces are all performed by different plastic injection molding processes and in different injection molds. The injection molding of the components allows efficient large-volume manufacturing of the table tennis racquets and, if desired, use of separate materials for each component of the table tennis racquet. In certain embodiments, the individual components are connected together during each of the injection molding processes so that a simple robust structure of table tennis racquet is produced. Further, by using four different injection molding processes, each of the components, the base body, the handle, the first playing surface and the second playing surface may comprise different polymeric materials. The four different polymeric materials may each have different physical or chemical properties or some of the components may be formed with similar or identical polymeric materials.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, any of the polymeric materials may be different than the other polymeric material incorporated in the components of the table tennis racquet. A polymeric material may differ from another polymeric material in at least one physical property such as, but not limited to, density, resilience, hardness, elongation, tensile strength, for example, or a chemical property such as, but not limited to, chemical composition, polymer structure, polymer blend, plasticizer content, colorant, processing additives, fillers, for example. The polymeric material may be a natural rubber, synthetic rubber or a blend of natural or synthetic rubbers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">There are many advantages to having the ability to form each component of the table tennis racquet in a different injection molding process. For example, the playing surfaces may be formed with different polymeric materials. Each injection molding process could use a different polymeric resin to form the playing surface on each side of the base body. Different polymeric materials may have different playability properties and/or colors, for example. Further, by forming the base body in a different injection molding process than the handle, the balance of the racquet may easily be controlled by using polymeric materials of different densities. Still further, a stiff rigid base body may be formed with a softer more comfortable handle. The different properties of the handle and the base body will also allow tuning of the playability of the racquet for offensive or defensive playing styles, for example.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">It can be provided that the base body can be produced in a first injection mold and attaching of the handle to the base body be performed in a second injection mold, wherein the second injection mold is different from the first injection mold.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, it may be provided that the plastic injection molding for the coating of the base body with the first polymeric material of the first playing surface is in a third injection mold and the plastic injection molding for the coating of the base body with the second polymeric material of the second playing surface is performed in a fourth injection mold. In a particular embodiment, the third and fourth injection molds are different molds. By the use of two unique injection molds for the two different playing surfaces, the playing surfaces may be separately produced with different colors, materials and/or structures. This also allows more versatile manufacturing process and the option to have many more playing surface combinations than using a single mold to coat both playing surfaces. For example, with three molds for a single side of the table tennis racquet, six combinations of table tennis racquets with different playing surfaces may be made, wherein with three double sided molds only three playing surface combinations can be produced.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the base body, after being removed from the first injection mold, is placed in the second injection mold to attach a handle to the base body in a second injection molding process. After the second injection molding for attaching the handle to the base body, the base body with the handle is removed from the second injection mold and placed in a third injection mold for molding of the first playing surface. After the molding of the first playing surface, the base body with the handle is removed from the third injection mold and placed into the fourth injection mold for coating the second playing surface. After coating the second playing surface, the table tennis racquet is removed from the fourth injection mold. This production of a table tennis racquet in four mutually different injection molds can produce inventive and high quality table tennis racquets at a high production rate. Further embodiments include a table tennis racquet. The table tennis racquet may comprise a plate-shaped base body, a first playing surface consisting of a first injection molded plastic on a first side of the base body, wherein the first plastic has a first color; and a second playing surface consisting of a second injection molded plastic on a second side of the base body opposite of the first side, wherein the second plastic has a second color which is different than the first color.</div>
