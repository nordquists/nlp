<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to sports training devices and, more particularly, to a device that uses a flash of light produced at a precise moment to train focus and concentration at the point of impact to facilitate hitting an object, such as a baseball, softball, golf ball, tennis ball, and the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Athletes may take their eyes off the ball prior to completing an athletic movement or sequence, such as swinging a bat. For instance, baseball hitters may not follow the entire trajectory of a baseball and actually observe the collision between the baseball and bat. It is well known in the art that watching the baseball as it is being struck facilitates effective hitting. Athletes need something that can help focus their concentration at a precise moment and place to train them to observe the point of impact.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous conventional drills, devices and tools are used to train athletes of several sports, such as baseball, golf and tennis, to keep their eyes on the ball and observe the collision. Athletes are coached to hit a round ball squarely with the sweet spot of the bat, club, racket, or the like. They must do this during a collision that takes place in an instant. Conventional devices and tools, that do not provide a unique event that attracts and induces anticipation from the collision point itself, do not adequately address the problem of athletes not observing the collision.</div>

The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention provides an athletic training device that trains athletes to observe the collision between a ball and bat, club, racquet, or the like. The training device may provide a unique illumination event, such as a flash of light, at the moment of the collision. Athletes can be trained to watch the ball, bat, club, racquet or the like, to note the flash of light, thereby focusing the attention of the athlete to “keep their eye on the ball”. The training device of the present invention can provide a unique event that attracts attention and induces anticipation from the collision point itself. The unique illumination event can be a light flash, multiple light flashes, colored light flashes, or the like. A coach may ask players to identify the light, for example, by its color, to help focus the attention of the players.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">The energy storage means <b>10</b> provides electrical power for the circuitry of the training device. The energy storage means <b>10</b> includes, for example, three AAAA style 1.5 volt alkaline batteries wired in series to provide a nominal 4.5 volt supply. Other energy storage means may be substituted, including batteries with different form factors, chemistries, voltages, and configurations. Alternately, a capacitor, supercapacitor, or rechargeable battery might be used. The training device might also incorporate a means to transform mechanical energy from motion or impact into electrical energy to power the circuitry, using common techniques known in the art, such as piezoelectric and/or magnet and coil means.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">The impact sensing means <b>12</b> provides a mechanism to detect acceleration of a magnitude sufficient to infer that a mechanical strike, hit, or impact has occurred. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the impact sensing means <b>12</b> of the present invention employs an electrically-conductive cantilevered spring <b>20</b> with a coaxial electrical-conductive header pin <b>22</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, both the cantilevered spring <b>20</b> and the header pin <b>22</b> are attached at one end to a circuit board <b>24</b>. Mechanical shock resulting from striking, hitting, or impacting the preferred embodiment causes the cantilevered spring <b>20</b> to flex and contact the header pin <b>22</b>. The cantilevered spring <b>20</b> contacting the header pin <b>22</b> provides an electrically conductive path between the two components that operates as a momentary switch. As shown in circuit diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the header pin <b>22</b> is electrically connected to an input of the logic means <b>14</b> that is biased with a resistor, such as a 100 kOhm resistor, to the circuit positive potential. When mechanical acceleration causes the cantilevered spring <b>20</b> to contact the header pin <b>22</b>, the input to the logic means <b>14</b> changes from the circuit positive potential to the circuit ground potential.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Each LED <b>26</b> includes a common anode and three cathodes (one for red, one for green, and one for blue). The color cathodes from each of the LEDs <b>26</b> are connected in parallel to the corresponding color control transistor in the switching means <b>16</b> through a current limiting resistor. Connected as shown, each transistor in the switching means <b>16</b> controls the on off status a single color of light (red, green, or blue) for all the LEDs.</div>

In an exemplary embodiment, the logic means <b>14</b> determines and controls the time, duration, and color of light flashes in response to a detected impact or acceleration. To conserve electrical power, the logic means <b>14</b> can remain in a sleep mode <b>30</b> while waiting for a signal resulting from an acceleration or impact. The sleep mode is a low power state provided as a feature of the microprocessor used in an exemplary embodiment. The logic means is configured to enter wake mode <b>34</b> whenever a signal level changes on the input pin connected to the impact sensing means <b>12</b>, indicating that an impact was detected <b>32</b> (as described earlier).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">Once the logic means enter wake mode <b>34</b>, the processor determines the next color <b>36</b> for the flash of light that will be used for this cycle. In each cycle, one color (red, green, or blue) is used in a single flash. In an exemplary embodiment, the logic means <b>14</b> uses a stored array of 64 pseudo-random two-bit numbers to obfuscate the color sequence, making it difficult for an athlete to predict the next color under typical usage. During each wake cycle, the logic means <b>14</b> retrieves the next color in the stored sequence. Many alternate methods may be also used to create random, pseudo-random, or difficult-to-predict colored flashes. Likewise, signal flashes are not limited to single pulses of red, green, or blue light, but may include pulse sequences and flash patterns of one or more colors. It is also possible to provide a means to let a coach or other training personnel preselect a color and/or pattern of the flash prior to use.</div>

The duration of the flash (the illumination event) in an exemplary embodiment is less than 1,000 milliseconds (ms), typically less than 500 ms, often the duration may be approximately 100 ms, although longer and shorter intervals are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention. The duration of the pulse is designed to ensure that visual focus must be directed toward the point of impact to see the flash unambiguously. Making the sequence of colors and/or patterns of light difficult to predict helps eliminate a tendency to guess, reinforcing the ability of a coach or training personnel to confirm that the athlete correctly witnessed the flash.</div>
