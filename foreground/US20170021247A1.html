Players hit the ball over a net placed on the ground with the goal of hitting the ball so the opposing player cannot return the shot.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, paddles used in pickleball may be made of metal, wood or composite materials. The construction and the weight characteristics of the paddle can have an effect on how a ball rebounds off of the paddle when a player hits a shot. When a player hits a ball near an edge of the paddle, the result of the shot is different than when the ball is hit near the center of the paddle. Often, when the ball is hit near the edge of the paddle, power on the shot is lost, while more power is generated when the ball is hit near the center of the paddle. Different players may prefer either more power or more control. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a paddle that is made from different materials to provide a player's desired performance and to compensate for the loss of power on an off-center shot.</div>

For example, in several embodiments, the material that forms the central area of the core is denser and more rigid than the outer area of the core area. Changing the densities and/or the distribution of mass and density can affect the center of balance and the size and location of the paddle's sweet spot. As the center of balance of the paddle moves away from the geometric center and/or as the density differs, the playing characteristics can be adjusted, for example, to allow a greater playable area while minimizing dead spots and paddle deflection. The central area can be made from a dense material such as Nomex, and the peripheral portions can be made from a less dense and less rigid poly material. In other embodiments, a lighter, less dense material can be in the center.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure pertains generally to the field of paddles used for racquet sports such as pickleball and particularly to a paddle made with a core including at least two portions formed of different materials of different densities. In structure, the basic paddle or blade shape is cut or otherwise shaped from a core layer material. In some embodiments, a center portion of the core layer may then be cut out or otherwise removed to form an opening in the core. Other embodiments may have a core portion that is formed with a center portion already missing rather than needing to be cut out. A piece of second material is then shaped to match the opening and assembled into the opening. Paddle covering materials, such as a laminate sheet, may then be applied to both faces of the assembled core, for example using adhesive, to form the two playing surfaces.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">The rebound characteristics of a ball hit off a paddle depends on the location at which the ball hits the paddle. Traditional pickleball paddles of a single density have a center of balance that is found near the middle of the blade portion of the paddle. This portion of the paddle is often referred to as the sweet spot. A ball hit near the sweet spot of the paddle has more power than a ball that is hit near the edges of the paddle with the same effort. Therefore, it is often desirable to have a paddle that has a large sweet spot located at the portion of the paddle at which the player is most likely to strike the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) endorses rules of pickleball for tournament play and international competitions. The rules of the IFP include equipment requirements that specify allowable paddle characteristics. A pickleball paddle must be constructed from a relatively rigid, non-compressible material. The hitting surface of the paddle cannot include holes, indentations, textured material, or any feature that applies additional spin to the ball. Rubber, synthetic rubber, sandpaper, moving parts that increase momentum, springs or spring-like material, and flexible membranes or compressive material that creates a trampoline effect are not allowed on the surface of the paddle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">The rigidity and compressibility of a paddle is determined using a deflection test. A common deflection test used to determine the rigidity of a paddle applies a force of <b>3</b> kg to the center of the paddle. The distance the paddle deflects due to the 3 kg force is recorded to provide a measurement of the paddle's rigidity. A paddle that has a deflection of 0.005 inches or less in the 3 kg test is considered to meet the IFP rigidity specifications.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to regulating the rigidity of a paddle, the IFP also specifies size requirements. The combined length and width of a paddle cannot exceed 24 inches. These measurements include any additional length or width added by an edge guard or a butt cap added to the end of the handle. There are no restrictions on the weight of the paddle or the thickness of the paddle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">It may be desirable to adjust the density distribution and the center of balance of a paddle to adjust the playing characteristics of the paddle to fit different styles of play, while also staying within the paddle requirements and rules set forth by the IFP. Adjustments made to the density distribution and center of balance of a paddle may alter the size and location of the sweet spot and the rebound characteristics of portions of the paddle. These adjustments may be used, for example, to increase the size and optimize the location of the sweet spot, but also to improve or adjust the characteristics of those areas of the paddle found on the periphery or elsewhere on the paddle blade.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">As an example, when a ball is hit off a more rigid material, there will be less rebound energy transferred from the paddle to the ball. Although this more rigid material produces less rebound speed of the ball off of the paddle than a less rigid material, it gives the player greater control of the shot. This more rigid material may be desired near the sweet spot of the paddle where a shot hit at this location will already have sufficient speed enabling it to rebound without significant speed or energy loss. In contrast, a lighter, less rigid material may transfer more rebound energy to the ball from the paddle, increasing speed and power at the expense of some of the player's control of where the ball is directed after it is hit. The less rigid material may be desired in peripheral portions of the paddle to increase power, for example in an off-center hit.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Using two materials or areas with different densities allows the playing characteristics of the paddle to be engineered as desired by controlling the density, rigidity, and location of the different materials used. By selectively arranging the locations with different densities, the playing characteristics can be adjusted, for example, to create a larger sweet spot and playable area while minimizing dead spots. As an example, the center portion of the paddle may be made from a dense material with a smaller cell size to improve control while peripheral portions may be made from a less dense material with a larger cellular structure that increases rebound power.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a paddle <b>20</b> including a handle <b>30</b> and a blade portion <b>40</b>. Typically, a paddle covering <b>42</b> is located on each face of a planar blade <b>40</b> to form opposing hitting surfaces; however, in other embodiments there may be no paddle covering <b>42</b> and the faces are formed by the faces of a core of paddle <b>20</b>. Paddle coverings <b>42</b> may be thin sheets or films of material. Paddle coverings <b>42</b> may be made from a non-compressible material, for example, plastic, metal such as aluminum, graphite, cork, fiberglass, a composite material such as an epoxy or carbon fiber in resin, or any other suitable material. Paddle coverings <b>42</b> may be the same for both faces of blade <b>40</b>, or a different covering <b>42</b> may be used for each face. The perimeter of blade portion <b>40</b> defines a paddle edge <b>44</b>. In some embodiments, an edge guard (not shown) may be attached around edge <b>44</b>.

Although handle <b>30</b> extends from blade <b>40</b>, the width and thickness of handle <b>30</b> may differ from the width and thickness of blade <b>40</b>. Handle <b>30</b> is sized to allow a user to grip and use paddle <b>20</b> comfortably using one hand, so typically, handle <b>30</b> is sized to have a smaller width than blade <b>40</b> but a greater thickness. Handle <b>30</b> may be made from the same material as blade <b>40</b>, or may be made from a different material. Handle <b>30</b> may be designed from a soft material or a harder material, and may include ridges or another form of texture to make handle <b>30</b> easier to grip. In some embodiments, a wrap or a grip may surround handle <b>30</b> to make holding the paddle more comfortable and/or to enhance paddle control.</div>

Typically, yet optionally, paddle coverings <b>42</b> are layered on both sides of planar core layer <b>50</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). A planar cross-section of planar core layer <b>50</b> is constructed of at least two material areas, for example, an outer portion <b>52</b> and a central portion <b>54</b>. The two portions are made of different materials that may be chosen for specific characteristics that affect the playing characteristics of the paddle <b>20</b>. For example, the different rigidities and densities of the material used for outer portion <b>52</b> and central portion <b>54</b> may provide different speed or control characteristics when a ball is hit. In some embodiments, the different materials may be the same base material, but have different density characteristics. For example, the two material areas may both be made from polypropylene, but the respective polypropylenes used for the material areas have different densities. In some embodiments, the materials used for the material areas of planar core <b>50</b> may have a honeycomb structure or may be made from an open or closed cellular material.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">As an example, in one embodiment of paddle <b>20</b>, outer portion <b>52</b> may be made from a comparatively lighter, less dense material, such as polypropylene or polyethylene, and central portion <b>54</b> may be made from a comparatively denser, more rigid material, such as Nomex or aluminum. Although outer portion <b>52</b> is made of a less dense material than central portion <b>54</b>, the less dense material of outer portion <b>52</b> should be chosen so that the rigidity of paddle <b>20</b> conforms with the allowable rigidity maintained by the IFP.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">Because the sweet spot of the paddle is most often found near the center of the paddle rather than the edges, in some embodiments, it may be desired that the material used for outer portion <b>52</b> is less dense and less rigid than the material used for central portion <b>54</b> to provide extra power when the ball is struck near the edge <b>44</b> of paddle <b>20</b>. The extra power provided by the less rigid material used for outer portion <b>52</b> is not as necessary when a ball is hit near the sweet spot of paddle <b>20</b> located in central portion <b>54</b>. Therefore, it may be desired to use a denser, more rigid material in central portion <b>54</b> to provide greater control of the shot. However, if a player strikes the ball near the edge of paddle <b>20</b>, a less dense and less rigid material may be desired for outer portion <b>52</b> to provide more power to compensate for the loss of power due to not hitting the ball squarely.</div>

First, a paddle-shaped planar core is formed <b>110</b> from a first material area. The planar core includes an edge, a top face, a bottom face, and defines an open area. A second material area is then inserted <b>120</b> into the open area. The second material area has a different density than the first material area. Also, the second material area has a planar area that matches the size of the open area. Once inserted into the open area, the second material area is assembled <b>130</b> with the first material area to form the planar core. A paddle covering is attached <b>140</b> to the top face of the planar core, and then the same paddle covering or a separate paddle covering is attached <b>150</b> to the bottom face of the planar core.
