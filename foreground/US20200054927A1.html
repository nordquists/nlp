<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Many people enjoy games involving balls. Every day, millions of people play basketball, tennis, soccer, volleyball and the like. Most of these games, however, have various physical components which limit where they can be played. For example, basketball requires a basketball hoop and a relatively large area of clear ground, soccer requires goals and tennis and volleyball require a net and large areas of clear ground. Because of this, people often avoid playing a particular game at outings, such as on the beach, at a picnic or when camping.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Ball games are good for a variety of reasons. In addition to being fun and entertaining, they encourage people to engage in activities which promote physical activity which provides health benefits and may reduce the effects of aging by encouraging movement of the limbs.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the boundary markers may be attached to or attachable to a central boundary marker which identifies a central point in the game in which the ball may not be hit during play without penalty. The elongate boundary markers may be selectively attachable to the central boundary marker and to an exterior boundary marker so as to allow users to select the number of slices present in the game. Thus, for example, the game could be made to provide 2 slices, 3 slices, 4 slices, 6 slices, etc. Thus, the game can be adjusted to compensate for the number of people who are available to play.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the game may include a plurality of rules which define the process for playing the game. The rules may require the players to stand in one of a number of areas, referred to as a slice, designated by the elongate boundary markers. The rules may further require paddles to be used to hit a ball in an upward trajectory toward the slice of another player such that if the ball lands in that players slice a point is accessed against that player.</div>

The skilled artisan will understand, however, that the methods described below can be practiced without employing these specific details, or that they can be used for purposes other than those described herein. Indeed, they can be modified and can be used in conjunction with products and techniques known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. The drawings and the descriptions thereof are intended to be exemplary of various aspects of the invention and are not intended to narrow the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the drawings may show aspects of the invention in isolation and the elements in one figure may be used in conjunction with elements shown in other figures.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference in the specification to “one embodiment,” “one configuration,” “an embodiment,” or “a configuration” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment, etc. The appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places may not necessarily limit the inclusion of a particular element of the invention to a single embodiment, rather the element may be included in other or all embodiments discussed herein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics of embodiments of the present disclosure may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details may be provided, such as examples of products or manufacturing techniques that may be used, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that embodiments discussed in the disclosure may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations may not be shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">Before the present invention is disclosed and described in detail, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular structures, process steps, or materials discussed or disclosed herein, but is extended to include equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those of ordinarily skill in the relevant art. More specifically, the invention is defined by the terms set forth in the claims. It should also be understood that terminology contained herein is used for the purpose of describing particular aspects of the invention only and is not intended to limit the invention to the aspects or embodiments shown unless expressly indicated as such. Likewise, the discussion of any particular aspect of the invention is not to be understood as a requirement that such aspect is required to be present apart from an express inclusion of that aspect in the claims.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">It should also be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, singular forms such as “a,” “an,” and “the” may include the plural unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a bracket” may include an embodiment having one or more of such brackets, and reference to “the target plate” may include reference to one or more of such target plates.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term “substantially” refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result to function as indicated. For example, an object that is “substantially” enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context, such that enclosing the nearly all of the length of a lumen would be substantially enclosed, even if the distal end of the structure enclosing the lumen had a slit or channel formed along a portion thereof. The use of “substantially” is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, structure which is “substantially free of” a bottom would either completely lack a bottom or so nearly completely lack a bottom that the effect would be effectively the same as if it completely lacked a bottom.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term “generally” refers to something that has characteristics of a quality without being exactly that quality. For example, a structure said to be generally vertical would be at least as vertical as horizontal, i.e. would extend 45 degrees or greater from horizontal. Likewise, something said to be generally circular may be rounded like an oval but need not have a consistent diameter in every direction.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term “about” is used to provide flexibility to a numerical range endpoint by providing that a given value may be “a little above” or “a little below” the endpoint while still accomplishing the function associated with the range.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">Concentrations, amounts, proportions and other numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of “about 1 to about 5” should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 2, 3, and 4 and sub-ranges such as from 1-3, from 2-4, and from 3-5, etc., as well as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, individually. This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value as a minimum or a maximum. Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a top view of a ball game, generally indicated at <b>4</b>, made in accordance with aspects of the present invention. The ball game includes a playing area <b>8</b> which is divided into a number of player playing areas or slices <b>12</b>. The playing area <b>8</b> is defined by an outer boundary marker <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> has been laid out in a circular shape. It will be appreciated that other shapes could also be used. The outer boundary marker <b>16</b> may be made from an elongate piece of material such as nylon strap, rope, or cord. It is preferable for collapsibility of the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> that the material is made is flexible. While the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> may be formed in a circle with <b>2</b> opposing ends sewn together, the outer boundary marker may also be formed with a releasable attachment <b>20</b>, such as hook and loop fastener (a.k.a. VELCRO), a button snap or other fasteners. Providing a releasable attachment <b>20</b> allows the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> to be folded compactly for storage. It will also be appreciated that the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> may be formed from a material of a different color or size. This helps users to distinguish the outer boundary marker during set up and also makes it more visible during play.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036">The playing area <b>8</b> may also include a central boundary marker <b>24</b>. The central boundary marker <b>24</b> may be simply formed from an elongate piece of boundary marker material, or may include central material <b>28</b> which can include the name of the game, advertising, or other information. The central boundary marker <b>24</b> may be of virtually any size, with the larger the size causing more challenging play for reasons which will be discussed below with respect to rules for the game.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">Extending between the central boundary marker <b>24</b> and the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> are a plurality of elongate inner boundary markers <b>32</b>. The inner boundary markers <b>32</b> divide the area between the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> and the central boundary marker <b>24</b> into the player play areas or slices <b>12</b>. Thus, the number of inner boundary markers used will determine the number of slices. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are 4 inner boundary markers <b>32</b>, resulting in 4 slices <b>12</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> may be generally fixedly attached to the central boundary marker <b>24</b>. This could be accomplished, for example, by placing two elongate nylon straps in an overlapping perpendicular relationship and then placing the central boundary marker over the juncture and sewing the elongate nylon straps to the central boundary marker <b>24</b>. Alternatively, each inner boundary marker <b>32</b> could be sewn at one end to the central boundary marker <b>24</b> or the central material <b>28</b>. Likewise, releasable attachments such as hook and loop fastener, snaps, buttons, hooks etc. could be used. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer ends of the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> include a fastener <b>36</b>, such as hook and loop fastener or other fasteners as discussed above to secure the inner boundary markers to the outer boundary marker <b>16</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039">Set up of the playing area <b>8</b> can be done relatively quickly. With the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the central boundary marker <b>24</b> and the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> may be folded together. The outer boundary marker <b>16</b> is likewise folded for storage. To set up the game one need only open the storage sack, etc., unfold the central boundary marker <b>24</b> and layout each of the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> in the manner shown. The outer boundary marker <b>24</b> as laid out and the fasteners <b>36</b> at the end of each inner boundary marker <b>32</b> are attached to the outer boundary marker. Thus, setting up the playing area can take as little as 1 to 2 minutes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">The ball game <b>4</b> also includes a plurality of rackets or paddles <b>40</b> and a ball <b>44</b>. In playing the game, each player would stand in their own slice <b>12</b> while holding one of the paddles. In one example of play, the paddle <b>40</b> is used to hit the ball into play with a serve. After the ball has been hit by the paddle <b>40</b>, the ball during a serve must pass above the servers' shoulders. Thereafter, each hit need only be in an upward direction. If the ball lands in one of the slices, such as slice <b>12</b> <i>a</i>, the person standing in the slice is assessed a point or a “burn”. If a ball lands outside the outer boundary marker <b>24</b>, the player who hit the ball is assessed a burn. If the ball lands within the area of the inner or central boundary marker <b>24</b>, the player that hit the ball receives a burn. Once a player has a predetermined number of burns, such as 7 burns or 10 burns, the player is eliminated from the game. The remaining players continue to play until only one player remains with fewer than the predetermined number of burns. Some rules may be modified once a player is removed. For example hitting the ball into an empty slice may result in a burn for the party hitting the ball. Additionally, the players may be repositioned in the slices to balance the game as players are eliminated. Alternatively, players may be assigned multiple slices. Thus, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one player may have to defend both of the slices <b>12</b> on the right side while the other player may have to defend both of the slices on the left side.</div>

</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0043">The game is comprised of a circular court outlined by a long red strap that is laid out around the small white “Shaka circle” in the middle. There are four (4) black straps attached to the white Shaka circle, that are pulled out straight to attach to the red outside circle (with VELCRO). This creates 4 equal sized “slices” that the players play inside.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0044">The easiest way to set up the ShakaBall court is to first (a) “pop” out the white Shaka circle (careful it pops quickly once you unwrap it!), then (b) lay it on flat ground (grass, dirt or sand is best, but it can be played on any flat surface) and (c) pull the black straps straight out from the circle. Next, (d) unwrap the red strap and lay it down in a circle that connects to the ends of the black straps, and (e) use the Velcro at the end of the black straps around the red strap circle. Lastly, (f) walk around the big circle to fix the red strap so that the slices are somewhat even (doesn't have to be perfect), and (g) pull the paddles and ball out of the bag to get ready to play!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

After the serve, the ball can be hit at any height, as long as it is hit with an obvious upward trajectory. Drop shots, trick shifts and spin shots are encouraged, as long as they have an upward trajectory off the paddle.</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0049">4) After every point, the players shift clockwise to the next slice, so that players are rotating through every slice throughout the game.</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0050">5) Each player tries to avoid getting burns, while trying to get the opponents to receive burns.

The various components shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are generally the same as those in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and are numbered accordingly. One difference is that the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> is longer—as shown by tail <b>16</b> <i>a</i>—and may overlap when sized similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the tail <b>16</b> <i>a </i>is additional length of elongate material which allows the outer boundary marker <b>16</b> to be expanded to have a greater diameter as shown by outer boundary marker <b>16</b> <i>b</i>. Each of the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> may also have a tail <b>32</b> <i>a </i>or peace which is unused when the outer boundary marker is shown in the position of <b>16</b>, but which may be used to attach to the outer boundary marker in the position shown as <b>16</b> <i>b</i>. This enables the players to exercise some control over the size of the slices <b>12</b>. For young children or older adults, a smaller slice size may be used. In the alternative, teenagers and young adults may prefer larger slice sizes as defending your slice grows more challenging with the greater the surface area covered thereby. The inner boundary markers <b>32</b>/<b>32</b> <i>a </i>can be attached to the outer boundary marker <b>16</b>/<b>16</b> <i>b </i>by the use of various fasteners <b>36</b> such as hook and loop snaps buttons and other fasteners known in the art. Such fasteners <b>36</b> can also be used to hold the unused portion of the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> <i>a </i>when the playing area is in the reduced size.</div>

Rather than using four inner boundary markers <b>32</b>, this configuration uses only 3 and divides the playing area outside the central boundary marker <b>24</b> into 3 slices <b>12</b>. In this configuration, a smaller number of players can begin the game without requiring the use of an empty slice. It will also be appreciated that rules of the game could be changed in such a way that if there are more players who wish to play than slices, when a player is dismissed from the game for receiving <b>7</b> or some other predetermined number of burns, a new player is able to enter the game to fill the empty slice.</div>

Likewise, the playing area <b>8</b> can be configured to allow a larger number of players. Thus, for example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a playing area with 5 inner boundary markers <b>32</b> so as to form 5 slices. The inner or central boundary area <b>24</b> can be in the shape of a pentagon or could be other shapes so long as the inner boundary markers <b>32</b> can be attached. It will also be appreciated that the size of the area within the central boundary marker <b>24</b> will have an effect on the difficulty of the game. If landing the ball in the area <b>28</b> within the central boundary marker <b>24</b> counts as a burn, or multiple burns, the larger the area the more challenging as the player must hit the ball sufficiently to get over the central boundary marker without going over the outer boundary marker <b>16</b>.</div>
