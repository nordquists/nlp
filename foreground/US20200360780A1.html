<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA422301613">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A shock-absorbing handle structure for a sports racquet includes a main core body. An outer surface of the main core body is partially or completely covered with a shock absorbing structure. The shock absorbing structure is made of an ETPU (expanded thermoplastic polyurethane) material. The ETPU material is used as the shock absorbing structure. The shock absorbing structure is attached to the outer surface of the main core body, which has a simple structure. The ETPU material has a better elastic and rebound effect and improves the shock absorbing effect of the whole handle effectively. It is light in weight, and can improve the hand feeling and enhance the anti-slip effect and prevent sports injuries.</div>
