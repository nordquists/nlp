<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention relates to the art of coating articleswith rubber and is adapted to provide a rubber coating for a surface of any article composed of practically any material. The invention is 5 adapted to provide a rubbercoating or lining for containers or conduits for carrying acids or acid fumes and can be followed to provide a rubber coating for articles composed of wood, for example, table tennis racquets, the handles of golf clubs, base ball bats and other handles. The invention is illustrated in the drawing and herein described as applied to a base ball hat, but it is understood that it is not limitedto this use. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Objects of the invention are to provide an improved method of coating articles or parts thereof with rubber which may be economically followed to provide an article having a rubber .coated. surface which will be securely and permanently he] thereon. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other objects are to provide an improved rubber coating having a fine, irregularly wrinkled surface which will be of attractive appearance and which will provide a non-slipping surface, which will not irritate the hands and will form an eflicient handle grip. A </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Additional objects are to provide an impermeable rubber coating for articles which will exclude moisture or any liquid; gases or fumes therefrom and which will form .a tough resisting surface adapted to cushion a shock and which will not be easily marred or otherwise injured. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The above objects are accomplished and additional ends are attained by the novel process of manufacture and the improved article herein described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein there is illustrated a product constructed in accordance with this invention with one form of apparatus which may be employed for performing certain steps of the improved process herein described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the drawing:- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a portion of a base ball bat having a handle coated with rubber in accordance with this invention, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">steps of the improved process herein described, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken as indicated by the lines 3-3 of Figure 2 and illustrating Figure 2 is a similar view illustrating certain proved product constructed in accordance with this invention, the same being taken as indicated by the lines 5-5 of Figure 1, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of the apparatus for curing the coated article. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The handle portion of the wooden bat l is first thoroughly cleaned. The clean portion is then dipped in lacquer, varnish or other coating mate rial formed by dissolving a gum, resin or other suitable substance in a solvent of rubber and which is adapted to congeal into a firm, hard, lasting layer ii. When the coating 8 is partly congealed and is in a sticky, or tacky condition, the handle is dipped into a rubber solution to form the layer 9. The rubber solution employed is formed by dissolving rubber in a suitable solvent such as naphtha, benzol, etc., preferably a solvent of the solids employed in forming the coating ii. The layer 9 is permitted to congeal and like layers Ill and H may be likewise deposited until a coating of the desired thickness is formed] In dipping the handle a in a rubber solution, I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">prefer to dip each succeeding layer to a difierent depth as shown in Figure 2 to form a tapered or stepped-01f surface adjacent the ing thus formed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The coating thus formed of the layers 3, 9, it, and l l is permitted to thoroughly dry or congeal and the same is then submitted to vulcanization. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In carrying out the invention, any suitable apparatus may be employed. In Figure 6 there is shown an oven it having an opening it through which the article may be introduced. The oven is provided at the bottom thereof with a plate it which is heated by the stove H5 or other suitable. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">means. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The numeral it denotes the delivery end of a tube through which sulphur chlorid is introduced into the oven It, a suitable valve ll being employed to regulate'the flow of the sulphur chlorid therethrough. The delivery end of the pipe it is positioned over the plate it whereby the sulphur chlorid will be delivered thereon and immediately changed into a vulcanizing vapor by the hot; plate It. The numeral l8 denotes a steam line through which steam is introduced into the oven l2. The stove M'and the valve H in the steam line l8 are regulated to maintain a temperature in the oven at approximately F. the exact temperature varying in accordance with the result desired. The article I is introduced through the opening l3 entirely positioning the coated area therein and the same is permitted to remain in the oven H from five to eight minutes in accdrdance with the coarseness of the grained surface desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">edge of the coatthan thatfcreated in the oven II. The sulphur chlorid completes the cure and forms fine, closely spaced, irregular wrinkles over the exposed surface of the coating thus formed; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> While I have slgiwn particular means for heating the oven I it is understood that the coating may be subjected to heat by any form of apparatus in any desired manner and while I have specified sulphur chlorid as a curing agent, it is understood that any suitable curing agent may be employed if desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be seen that the coating 8 and the coating 9 being formed with the sameor a similar solvent will intimately unite an d that the coating it will firmly adhere to both the handle l and the layer 9. -The successive layers t, it, and H become an integral part of the layer 9 thereby forming a rubber sheath which is in fact an integral part of the handle '8 and which cannot be removed therefrom without dissolving or melting the layer 8. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In using a dispersion of rubber such as liquid rubber latex, alcohol may be used with the iatex to form the layers 9, iii, and i II and the lacquer or other coating formed by dissolving gums, varnish or other suitable substance in alcohol, it being essential to secure the best results to provide a lacquer and a rubber coating which are formed by the same or a related solvent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be understood that the term rubber employed in the specification and in the claims shall include synthetic rubber, rubber substitutes and other similar material and that the word lacquer" as used in the specification and claims shall include varnish and any other suitable solution or dispersion of a similar character or any suitable liquid or material which will set to form a coating of the character herein described. While the various layers have been described as formed by dipping, it is understood. that the same may be applied or formed in any suitable manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process is particularly adapted for coatmomma ing the interior surface of containers for holding acids or other liquids which cannot be successfully held in ordinary containers and may be followed to coat metal ventilator pipes and other pipes or conduits designed to carry liquids or vapors injurious to metal. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having thus fully described a new product and disclosed a new process of manufacture, I claim: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. That method of coating wood with rubber which consists of first applying a coating of lacquer to the wood, permitting the same to partly congeal, then adding a coating of rubber to the coating of lacquer while the same is in a partly congealed condition, subjecting the coating to heat and sulphur chloride fumes then simultaneously cooling and vulcanizing the coating. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. That method of coating an article with rubber which consists in first applying a coating of lacquer, permitting the same to partly congeal; applying a coating of liquid rubber while the lacquer is in a partly congealed condition, submitting the rubber coating to heat and sulphur chlorid fumes, then subjecting the rubber coating to a relatively cold solution of sulphur-chlorid. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3. That method of coating an article with rubber which consists of first applying a coating of lacquer, permitting the same to partly congeal, applying a coating of liquid rubber while the lacquer is in a partly congealed condition; applying successive coating of liquid rubber until a rubber cover of the desired thickness is formed, submitting the rubber to heat, then suddenly cooling the outer portion of the rubber cover and submitting the same to vulcanization. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 4. That method of coating an article with rubber which consists in first applying a base coating of lacquer, forming a solution of rubber and a solvent of said lacquer; applying a coating of said solution; applying successive coatings of liquid rubber until a rubber cover of the desired thickness has been built up thereon, then submitting the cover thus formed to heat to thoroughly heat the same, then submitting the same to the action of cold sulphur chloride. </div>
