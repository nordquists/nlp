<div class="description-paragraph"> 'I'his invention is an improved racket or bat for use in games, such as table tennis, lawn tennis, squash, badminton, and the like. While the invention is illustrated for table tennis, the struc- Y ture Vand functional purpose of the `invention maybe embodied in racket's for lawn tennis, badminton, squash, and the like. v </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The usual racket in games of the type here involved, is provided with a straight handle, although some rackets have been proposed where thehandle is at an angle with respect to thev striking face of the racket, as in the patent to Taylor No. 335,656, of 1886,* and the patent to Girdwood No. 703,911, of '1902. According to the such is desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> than to the right. Also, with ones forearm hanging relaxed at ones side, the hand can be turned at the wrist toward the body through a much greater angle than itcan be turned in the op- 35 posite direction from the initial position. In order to compensate for these factors, thestrikright for making a stroke in such'position. The ease of making and the resultant accuracy and this invention all improved. |45 The foregoing principles are structurally embodied in a racket which may take a-number of possible forms. In one aspect, the upper end of the handle is offset with respect to the striking face of the racket, this handle, however, being 50v angularly mounted so that its longitudinal axis intersects theplanerin which the striking face lies, at apoint below the `outside of this striking face. This angle may conveniently be about and the point of intersection just mentioned is approximately'at or near the lower end of the enables one to hit' the ball more squarely, Whenw With certain positions of-the forearm, Ain the case of a right-handed player, the user nds that he can twist the forearm Vfurther to the` left'Y ing face of the racket is angularly offset to the right, so that the right-handed player does not*V need to turn his forearm and/or wrist quite so 4'0 far tothe right to get. the racket well to the power of forehand and backhand strokes are, by </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Cl. 273-76)v handle. This is probably the simplest aspect `of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">i 'I'he handle, in addition to the angular oiset just described, may also be providedwith another type of offset; the longitudinal axis of the handle 54 which, in this case, is vertical when considered in front view, maybe laterally offset with respect to the vertical longitudinal axis of the striking face, so thatplanes, perpendicular to the striking face land passed through said axes, respectively, 101 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">would be parallel and separated by an amount corresponding to said oiset. The axis of the handleintersects the plane in which the striking face lies, at a point below and outside said strik-S ing face, at or near the lower end of the handle. 1`5v` The invention, in still another aspect, may be provided with a handle which is both angularly and laterally oiset, as described above. In addition, however, the longitudinal axis of the handle, when considered in front view, is tipped 20 or slanted with respect to a plane passed through thevertical longitudinal axis of they striking mem-V ber and perpendicular thereto, so that the axisv of the handle intersects that plane at an angle i of approximately 15. g5 </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In these drawings: </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 14 is a fragmentary view in side elevation of certain details permitting various angular settings of the elements. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to these drawings, in which similar reference characters indicate similar parts, 2 indicates the striking member or racket face which, in the case of a table tennis racket, is usually covered with a roughened material 4. The longitudinal vertical axis of the striking member is shown at 6. Suitably secured to the lower edge of the striking member 2 is an offset 8, as by bolts ID passing through a small plateI2 and the upper portion I4 of the offset. The oset B extends downwardly and outwardly, as shown Figure 2, and to the outer end of this offset is The angle between the axis 6 of the striking member 2 and the central longitudinal axis I8 of the handle, is approximately 20, although this angle may be varied. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The axis I8 of the handle intersects the plane in which the striking member 2 lies at the point P, which`Y` isbelow'and outside'the face of the striking member, and preferably is at or near the lower end of the handle. While the'conhection between the upper end of the handle I6 and the lower edge of the racket is shown as an oifsetj, the details of this connection in the various embodiments of the invention, may be varied considerably. For example, the entire article may be built of plywood, which may be steamed to make it'ilexible, and the connection .nalY axis IBof the handle, as described in connection 'withFiguresl and 2. The handle I6', however, 'is'also laterally offset with respect tothe central'vertical longitudinal axis V6' by an amount S, this offset being measuredbetween the central longitudinal axis 6' of the racket and the central longitudinal axis I8 of the handle. To describe this offset in another way, if. planes both perpen-v dicular to the face of the striking member 2 are passed respectively" through the axes 6 and I8', </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">'these`pl'aiies would be parallel and separated by the distance: S. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' ReferringU now to the modication shown in Figures 6, 7 and 8, which isA one of the preferredY forms of the invention, the handle I6a is connected to thelower edge of the racket by the Voffset shown in Figure 6, so that a plane passed through the Vaxis .I.8a, perpendicular to the face ofV the racket, wouldintersect the axis 6a of the striking Ymember 2 at about the point I9. When the 65, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">racket is viewed from the front as in Figure 6, the apparent angle'between the axes 6u, and I 8a is about 15, although this angle is only apparent because the axes Sci and l8r;v do not actually intersect. This angle also may be described by stating that if planes perpendicular to the striking face of theV racket 2 are passed through the axes Biz/and Ia, the actual angle between such planes is about 15. The axis 16u. of the handle intersects the, Rlllqin Whchthe face of the racket lies at a point well below the racket at about thepointmR., </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This point P is approximately at the lower end of the handle, but the invention is not limited to the intersection at exactly this point. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to the modification shown in Figures 9 and 10, the upper end of the handle ISU is connected to the lower edge of the striking member 2 by the angular offset 8b, the upper end of the handle being offset to the right of the central axis 6b of the racket, as distinct from the modifications shown in Figures 3 and 6, where the upper end of the handle is offset to the left of the corresponding axis. The angle between planes, both perpendicular to the striking face of the racket and passedrespectively through the axes and I8b is approximately 15, as shown in Figure 9. The angle between axes 6h and I8bin the s'ide View of the racket is approin'mately.20. These angles, however, may be varied, as the invention isY not limited to these precise angular values. The oifset 8b in Figures 9 and 10, in addition to extending downwardly and forwardly tothe right, is also, as viewed in Figure 10, angularly set so that in side elevation one sees part of the top of the offset as distinct from the other views as in Figures 1, 3 and 6, where one sees the edge of the offset. This particular angular arrangement gives somewhat different balance to the racket which may be preferred by some users. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be noted in connection with Figures 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and.10 that the upper end of the handle is in a position to one side of a plane passing through the longitudinal axis of the striking face and perpendicular thereto. It will also be noted that the longitudinal axis of the handle intersects the plane of the striking member at approximately the lower end of the handle. It will still further be noted that the longitudinal axis of the handle and the longitudinal axis of the striking member are lines which are always spaced from one another and never intersect, even if indefinitely prolonged. The apparent intersection of the axes in Figure 6 is not a real intersection, as is evident from Figurek '7. The apparent intersection of the axes in Figure 4 is not a real intersection, as is apparent from Figure 3. The apparent intersectionof the axes in Figure 9 is not areal intersection as is evident from Figure l0. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to Figures 11 and 12, the connection between the handle 6 and the striking member 5 of theV racket is by means of an offset including a ball and socket. joint indicated'generany at 22, and minding a set screw 24 whereby the angular relationship between the handle and the racket.' face maybe varied as desired: andthe two' held in suchan'gular relationship by the set s 'c'rew 24, which bears againstv the ball of the ball socketjointz. Slots 26 may also be provided for a variable setting of the plate 28 connected by. bolts or thelike to the member 2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In order tovary the length of any of the offset connections between the handle and the striking member 4., such offset, as shown in Figure 1-3, may be composed of` two relatively slidable plates 3D and 32 which may be variably positioned by bolts 34 passing through suitable slots in the plates, wherebyit will beevident that the effective length of the` offset may be varied and such length fixed by tightening upon the bolts 34. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 14 shows a modification of the invention providing lfor a great many possible settings of the handle. In this modification the offset 8c con! sistsonoverlapping, relatively adjustable plates 3g an@ as ,wnich sfiiie relatively' to each otherv and may, be ,heldinnr adjustable position .by </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Athe lower edge of the Striking member and to the bolts 4l) passing through suitable slots in the plates.. Y </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Oneof these plates, such as`38,'is provided with a socket member 400i a balland socket joint, the ball member 42 of which is carried by the lower edge of the striking member 2, the relativeposition betweenthe ball and socket members being settable by a set screw 44. The other plate 36 maybe provided with a socketmember 46 of a ball and socket joint, the ball member 38 yof which is carried by the handle I6. This joint may also be 'set in any position by the set screw 50. The provision of the two ball and sockets just described gives an indenite number of angular variations between the handle, the oiset and the striking face so that a player who may desire a particular angular setting of theseparts may, by experiment and use of the set screws, achieve the precise angular setting that is most suitable for him. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' It is to be understood, furthermore, that of the three variable settings permitted by the structure of Figure 14, any one or any two, or all three,`may be embodied in a particular racket, as desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In all forms of the invention, the handle, in cross sectiornhas the shape of an elongated polygon,zpreferably having eight sides. The wider face of the handle, when the racket is viewed from the front, as in Figures 1, 3, 6, etc., is directly toward the observer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> While theinvention has been described in some detail, itshould beunderstood that the invention is not. limited to these precise details,-but may be carried out in other ways; </div>
