<div class="description-paragraph">Feb. 20, 1940- a. H. PERRYMAN TABLE TENNIS BAT Filed July 7, 1939 s dity. One of the principal objects of the invention is the provision ofa novel bat or racquet of this. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' 10 character constructed primarily of light material Patented Feb. 20, 1940 ,3,:Glaims." This invention relates to a newand' use ful provement in'racquets'or paddles for use in the playing of the game fPing-pong, table tennis such as laminated wood, the racquet being provided with reinforcing-means extending beyond the outer periphery of the body portion whereby such-racquet may be put to considerable hard servicewithout breaking, splitting or otherwise becoming defective. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object of the invention isto provide an improvedracquet structure for table tennis and like games having an improvedmeasure of stifiness, resiliency and flexibility, and. at the same time being oflight weight. a a A further object of the invention is the provision of an improved device of the character de scribed which is provided with a reinforcing member extending around substantially the entire periphery of the, playing portion of the racquet, the playing portion having an annular recess to receive the member, such reinforcing to the strength of the device and at the same time prevent injury to the paddle in the event that it strikes the table or other hard object with a 1 forcible blow. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the drawing, Fig. l is a the preferred embodiment of the present invention, with portions of the device being shown in] views similar to Fig. 3, such views showing modi- .ficaltions in the construction of the device constituting the present invention. v </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now more particularly to the drawing, the body portion of the paddle indicated at I0 is generally circular in shape and isprovided with a narrow, radially disposed extension II which serves as a base for-the'handle structure. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This body portion is preferably made from lami: nated wood or other suitable light weight sheet. material. By constructing this portion from laminated wood, the possibility of warping is re.- duced and the paddle will, of course, possess front elevation of Serial greater strength than if merely a singlethicknes of" 'woodor" other material were employed; "1 a The body portion is further formed with curved web portions 12 between the handle portion and said body portion which'give thehandle an in'- creased .-measure of strength and rigidity. The handle structure further includes facingsl l on opposite sides thereof, each of said facings new. ing onev flat surface which is secured to the portion is and, the opposed surface is curved, thus i'orming a .han'dle structure which'is. substantially circular in transverse section. The upper ends of such facings I4 are formed with concave, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">cutout portions l5, which portions are engaged v I by the thumb and forefingerof the player. The opposed playing surfaces of the body portion l0 may be fiat as shownin Figs. 1 and 2 or they may, if desired, beprovided with resilient facings l1- madepreferably of rubber and having a plural-v; </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">- Around the periphery 2B of the body portion is l formed an annularrecess 21 which is substan-i tially. semicircular in transverse section. Q'Ihis recess terminates at "each end thereof adjacent 'to the curved web portions I2, as shownin' Fig. 1. A metallic strip 23 which is preferably circular in transverse section extends around the periphery of this body portion'and. the inner surface thereof is positioned within the recess 2| as shown in' Fig. 3. 'Adjacent each terminal of this member, an aperture. is formed and a pin, screw,-or' </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> other similar article passes through such aperture and into the body portion l0, thus mounting the strip firmly upon the'body portion. It will thus be apparent from this construction that substantially-the entire periphery of the body. portion of the racquet iseffectively protectedby this strip 23, which, asshown in Fig. 3, extends beyond the: periphery of thebody portion, and accordingly, during the course of play, when the v bat strikes the playing table or other member, the .pro'tective'band effectively secures the marginal edges of the body portion against injury. </div>
