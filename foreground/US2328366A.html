The edges of the sheets H may be cemented to the flanges 3, Numerous projections I2 are formed integral with the outer surface of each sheet ll the'blade throughout their adjacent areas, andtbo and project beyond the planes of the flanges 3 ntia'lly reduoe the T (Fig. 4). The surfaces of the sheets II are in the same planes as the outer surfaces of the flanges 3. In this construction, the perforations 2 constitute cells that are filled with air, increasing the resiliency of the composite facings including the textile sections I and the rubber sheets ll. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The construction shown in Fig. 5 is the same as that already described, with the exception that the openings 2, functioningas air cells, are omitted, 'and'the textile sections") are cemented throughout the length and width thereof directly to the surfaces of the blade I. This modified construction in which the openings or air cells 2 are omitted contemplates an increase in the resiliency of the material of which the blade is formed. Thus, when the material is highly resilient, the openings'or air cells 2 maybe omitted; and, when the coefficient of resiliency of the metal is below that desired for the blade, the resiliency may be increased by forming theholes or air cells 2. a 1 v a From the foregoing, it is apparent that this invention, comprising a unitary resilient body portion, is substantially infrangible and WiHIlQt become permanently bent or warped, or otherwise distorted under changing conditions of temperature .and humidity. The device is easily handled in playing the game of table tennis because it is of light weight, the formation of the handle affords a strong retaining grip to prevent the handle from turning in the hand of the player, and it is practically impossible for the rubber sheet to become, detached or curled from the blade. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">1. In a table tennis bat, a body comprisinga relatively thin resilient blade having numerous flanges; and a sheet ofelastic material attached to and wholly covering the outer side of each of said sections and having its edge engaging the inner side of said adjacent flange and having its outer' surface approximately in thesame plane with the outer surface of said adjacent flange. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2, In a table tennis bat, a body comprising a relatively thin'resilient blade, flanges integral with and projecting laterally beyond the margins of said blade and leaving said blade substantially resilient, a handle connecting portion of approximately the same thickness as the combined thickness of said blade and said flanges integral with and projecting longitudinally beyond said flanges and said blade at one end of the latter, and a hollow handle integral with and projecting longitudinally beyond said connecting portion; a sheet of elasticmaterial fitted Within the area bordered by each of said flanges at the respective sides of said blade and its edge adjacent the inner side of the adjacent flange and also having its outer surface approximately in the same plane with the outer surface of said adjacent flange; and a substantially inelastic section of textile material having the same area as and attached to the concealed side of each of said sheets and also adhesively attached to said blade within the area bordered by elastic material attached to the outer side of each of said sections and cooperating with said sections to confine air within'said holes andalso having its edge adjacent to and contacting the inner side of said complementaryflange and also having its outer surface approximately in the same plane as the outer side of said complementary flange, numerous projections integral with the outer side of each of said sheets projecting outwardly beyondthe plane of said complementary flange, a handle connecting portion integral with andprojecting longitudinally beyond one end of said blade and having a thickness approximately equal to the combined thickness of said, blade and said flanges and leaving said blade resilient, and a handle integral with </div>
