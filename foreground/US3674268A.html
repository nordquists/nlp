<div class="description-paragraph">TABLE TENNIS PADDLE CONSTRUCTION WITH IMPROVED HANDLE MEANS THEREFOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Presently known table tennis paddles of conventional design are normally held by the user, whereby, the longitudinal and lateral axes of the paddle are substantially at right angles to the longitudinal and lateral axes of the user's hand. This requires added wrist movement by the user to bring the paddle into proper orientation for executing the wide variety of forehand and backhand driving and chopping return strokes normally encountered during the playing of the game. In addition, this added wrist movement to bring the paddle in proper orientation increases the time necessary to effect such return strokes and further becomes more fatiguing during prolonged use of such paddle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved table tennis paddle construction which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages and, in addition, is lightweight, durable, inexpensive and readily mastered by novices and seasoned player alike regardless of his former style of playing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The present invention relates to improvements in table tennis paddle constructions and more particularly to improved handle means, whereby, the paddle when held in a normal playing manner provides a longitudinal extension to the hand of the user so that the longitudinal and lateral axes of the paddle are substantially parallel and coplanar with the longitudinal and lateral axes of the users hand, thereby, enabling the user to effect a wide variety of forehand and backhand driving and chopping return strokes more quickly, during playing of such game, with less fatigue because no additional wrist movement is required other than that necessary to effect such return strokes. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In addition to the above, the present invention provides a table tennis paddle construction which is lightweight, durable, inexpensive and which has positive gripping means when held by the user in a relaxed manner, therefore, being further less fatiguing to the user during prolonged use thereof. </div>
