<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA36005326">
<div class="abstract">The invention concerns a table-tennis bat in which the core, which extends throughout the bat, is a lightweight wood and in which on each side of said core there is provided a lamina of considerably harder wood. The bat has the usual playing surface coating such as dimpled or foam rubber.</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES64597976">
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention relates to a wooden table-tennis bat in which the wood extends throughout the area of the handle and blade, or playing surface with a playing coating of dimple rubber, foam rubber or the like applied to it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As well as the usual bats of the kind described above it has been proposed to use thermoplastics material in some bats. From West German Gebrauchsmuster No. 6,901,244 there is known a bat in which the foundation consists of foamed thermoplstic plastics and forms one piece with the blade and handle. It is also known (see, e.g., German Gebrauchsmuster Nos. 7,108,376 or 7,034,351) to provide a core consisting of aluminum or a combination of a plastics honeycomb and aluminium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In spite of the various efforts hitherto made in this field it must be stated that in practice there is no table-tennis bat which fulfills in sum the requirements laid down for a table-tennis bat which are, namely to exhibit at the same time low weight, high strength and good rebound resonance. Thus, for example, in the case of the aforesaid aluminum bat with or without plastics honeycombe the rebound resonance is too great, and in the case of the usual wooden bats it is again not correct. For these reasons today bats are still made of plywood, the plywood being glued in three to five layers usually which are provided with rubber, dimple rubber and/or a foam rubber coating and having a particularly compact foam rubber foundation. In addition, bats of plastics or metal and also composite bats of these materials cannot be used as tournament or match bats because in accordance with the relevant international rules such materials are not permitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The object of the invention is to produce a table-tennis bat which fulfills all the aforesaid requirements, at the same time satisfying the extreme conditions imposed upon bats by strenuous sport and moreover fulfilling the specification of the international table-tennis rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with the invention a table tennis bat comprises a core of lightweight wood extending throughout the area of the handle and blade of the bat, a lamina of wood considerably harder than that of the core being provided on each side of the core, and a playing surface coating such as dimpled rubber provided on each lamina. One wood of which the core may be formed is balsa wood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The laminae may consist of a combinaion of woods of different hardnesses, whilst the handle may include further layers of the same wood as the core.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The advantages of the invention lie in particular in the fact that there is achieved by the combination of lightweight wood as the core of the bat and harder wood as the outer coating a bat of lower weight, but above all a particularly high strength compound construction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This light wood/hard wood combination ensures the necessary good rebound resonance, and possibilities of very widely differing variations in the hardness of the bat allowing a bat to be tailor made for an individual player and his style of play. In other words variation in the basic rebound resonance is made possible by different coating of the lightweight wood core whilst still preserving the low weight and adequate strength. Practically any desired rebound resonance can be achieved by selection of the lamina material(s) on the one hand and the thickness of it on the other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Through the coating of wood a quite oustanding feel of the ball is communicated to the player because the vibration of the bat, in contrast to the plastics and metal bats described above, is transmitted quite outstandingly to the hand holding it. Productionwise no particular difficulties exist or arise, since bats in accordance with the invention can be produced like the conventional plywood bats and hence demand no new or special production methods. As compared with a plywood bat, however, with a considerably lower weight a stronger rebound of the ball is achieved and hence higher ball speeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is the desire of the majority of table-tennis players to have available a bat as fast as possible, so that the play becomes on the whole faster and the reaction times become shortened, thus making the play more interesting. This enhanced play-incentive naturally increases the chances of sale and turnover of bats. Finally, because the handle may also consist of further layers of the lightweight wood, applied to the blade in accordance with known production methods, there is achieved besides the saving in weight the advantage of a particularly good grip. In other words a bat in accordance with the invention lies easily in the hand and is characterized by particularly good non-slip qualities, so that additional windings of leather, cork or the like usual for this purpose can be dispensed with.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The term "lightweight wood" employed in the foregoing also embraces such woods as are usual in the trade under the designation "softwood," in so far as they exhibit the characteristic of low weight demanded by the invention. Thus, to name but one example the mass density of balsa wood lies approximately between 0.1 and 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One example of a table tennis bat according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is an elevation of a table-tennis bat with the playing surface omitted;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a longitudinal section along the line II--II in FIG. 1;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 is a section along the line III--III in FIG. 1; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view similar to FIG. 3, but of a modification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The table-tennis bat shown consists in known manner of a blade 11 and a handle 15. The blade 11 carries the playing surface coating which may consist of dimple rubber, foam rubber or any other materials considered suitable, which is conventioanl and has been shown in FIG. 2 in cross section and only partially in FIG. 1 although it is understood that the entire blade portion 11 is to be covered on both sides with the playing surface 16 as indicated in FIG. 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The bat has a continuous core 12 of balsa wood, shaped to the outline of the bat, i.e., embraceing the blade 11 and the handle 15. This continuous core 12 is provided on both its flat faces with a coating 13 of hard, strength-increasing wood, for example, pine. This coating 13 extends across the whole area of the core 12. For shaping the handle 15 lightweight wood is applied at 14 in this zone, and firmly glued or fastened with other appropriate means to the outer faces of 13. Each of the coatings 13 may consist of a plurality of wood lamina of different hardenings, as shown in the modification of FIG. 4 at 13'. Otherwise, the modification of FIG. 4 is identical to the structure previously described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will be recognized that the handle 15 besides low weight obtains considerable rigidity which is to be attributed to the compound arrangement with the coating 13, so that the springiness of known one-piece added handles no longer occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The term lightweight wood includes more particularly those woods which have a mass density between 0.1 and 0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
