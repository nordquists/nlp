<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES66500370">
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to structures known as bats, racquets or paddles (hereinafter, "paddles") for use in ball games. It specifically relates to paddles for use in table tennis or ping pong games.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. History of the Prior Art In most racquet sports, particularly table tennis and ping pong (hereinafter collectively referred to as "table tennis"), the paddle consists of a flat paddle surface ("blade") of varying shape attached to, and in the same plane of, a handle. As a result of this single plane configurations any effort to strike a ball so it moves in any direction other than in a perpendicular plane to the player's body requires the player to twist or bend his or her wrist in proportion to the angle of ball movement which is desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the player's movements are constrained by the need to either rotate the paddle up to 180 degrees or more around the player's body, or to change the hands holding the paddle, to allow a backhand shot to be made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To explain, as opposed to the forehand side of the body, the backhand side is considered to be the one opposite the hand holding the paddle when the player is at rest. Similarly, the backhand side of the paddle is (as opposed to the forehand) that side which faces in the opposite direction of the palm of the hand which holds the paddle. To change play from forehand to backhand, therefore, the paddle must be fully rotated around the player's body from its forehand to its backhand side. Not only is this required rotation somewhat awkward to achieve, it also causes the player to lose much of the time available to address the ball to positioning the paddle for play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the traditional table tennis paddle consists of substantially cylindrical handle immovably attached to the paddle blade. Except for the possible presence on the handle of cushioning means (such as compressible foam), the handle does not conform structurally to the player's hand. As a result, it can only be gripped by allowing the hand to encompass the handle, leaving the paddle in a substantially perpendicular position with respect to the player's wrist. As a result, the most comfortable paddle position is not the one best suited for play, thus encouraging fatigue of the player's wrist and hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">What is needed, therefore, is a paddle for racquet sports, and particularly for table tennis, which allows the player to comfortably make both forehand, backhand and angled strokes with minimal adjustment of the paddle position.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In essence, the paddles of this invention consist of two principal structural components which are either formed separately and joined, or molded as a single piece. These components are the blade and handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment described, the attachment of the handle to the blade must include each of the following five points:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) The center line plane of the handle and the plane of the blade are two separate but intersecting planes between 0° and 45°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) The handle contained within its plane is rotated outward and downward from the upper attachment to the blade at an angle between 0° and 90°, thus allowing the paddle surface to be an extention of the arm rather than perpendicular to the wrist as is normal with conventional paddles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) The plane of attachment of the handle to the blade lies between the lines of intersection of the planes containing the two parallel sides of the handle with the blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) The blade extends only forward from the terminal end attachment line of the handle with the blade. This feature allows the same surface area on both sides of the blade for striking the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) A portion of the handle is tilted above or below its midline horizontal plane at an angle greater than 0° up to or at 20°, now referred to as the yaw of the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The yaw of the handle provides for a greater rotation of the paddle, for striking the ball, without having to rotate the wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the handles are structured to conform to the player's hand and a comfortable wrist position, and further configured to provide for a more secure grip than provided by conventional paddles.</div>
<heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a preferred configuration of the paddle;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken on line 2--2 of FIG. 1, showing the gripping alignment;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 is a front plan view of the paddle of FIG. 1 showing the yaw of the handle.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 depicts one embodiment of the invention paddle in perspective view. In this embodiment, blade 1 and handle 3 are separate components. Handle 3 is in substantially a "U" shaped configuration wherein each of the terminal ends of legs 4A and 4B of the "U" are attached by attachment means to the forehand face 6 of blade I along on edge thereof. This embodiment provides a most secure grip for a right handed player. A left handed paddle would be a mirror image of FIG. 1. The center line plane containing handle 3 and the forehand face 6 of blade 1 are two separate, but intersecting planes between 0° and 45°, best shown in FIG. 2. The handle 3 contained within its plane is rotated outward and downward from the attachment of upper leg 4A to blade 1 at an angle between 0° and 90°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The plane of attachment 5 of the handle 3 to the blade 6 lies between the lines of intersection of the planes containing the two parallel- sides 7 and 8 of the handle. The handle may be either open or closed. FIG. 1 demonstrates a closed handle where the grip of-the handle lies between an upper and lower attachment to the blade. An open handle would not have lower leg 4B and would, therefore, only attach at the terminal end of leg 4A. The closed handle provides the most secure attachment of the handle and blade to prevent any undesired movement between the two parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blade 6 extends only forward from the terminal end attachment line 9. This feature allows the same surface area on both sides of the blade for striking the ball. The blade may be any number of configurations, but is substantially configured within a 6 inch width by 6 inch height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A portion of the handle 3 is tilted above or below its midline horizontal plane at an angle greater than 0° up to or at 20°, now referred to as the yaw of the handle. FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 demonstrate the yaw of the handle. The Terminal end line 10 of Upper side wall 7 of handle 3 which is parallel with the center line plane of the handle, sets at an angle between 0° and 20° with the terminal end attachment line 9 between the handle and blade. The yaw of the handle provides for a greater rotation of the paddle, for striking the ball, without having to rotate the wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken on line 2--2 of FIG. 1 showing the gripping alignment. The thumb is positioned along the outer edge 11 of handle 3 to allow for greater rotational capability of the paddle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The angles of attachment of the handle to the blade allow the player to strike the ball with either side of the blade without rotation of his or her grip on the handle regardless of whether the ball approaches the player on the forehand or backhand side, although it is expected that the backhand surface of the blade will be used predominantly in play. It should be noted, that the angles of attachment allow for the most comfortable and effective play as they allow the player to rotate the blade with minimal motion to use its backhand surface on the forehand side of the body and, conversely, the forehand surface on the backhand side of the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The advantage of using the backhand surface of the blade predominantly to strike the ball in play is that the response time needed to set up the play by rotating the paddle from the backhand to the forehand side is eliminated. For that reason, the angled handle will enhance backhand play, but will allow forehand strokes to be utilized to best advantage in strokes requiring the ball to be stroked forcefully downward onto the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1 and 2 show the most preferred handle configuration for a very secure grip while allowing the player to have a semi-relaxed hand grip during play. The handle has two curvatures along the gripping surface to conform, respectively, to the index and, possibly, the middle finger of the player's hand (with the thumb resting along the top outer edge II,) while the second curvature accommodates the remaining fingers of the player's hand. The extension between two of the fingers stabilizes the handle and prevents it from sliding out of position while being held onto lightly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications can be made to the embodiment of the invention disclosed herein without departing from the spirit or concept of the invention.</div>
