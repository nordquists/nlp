<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates toping pong. More particularly, the present invention relates to an illuminated enhancement to the game equipment.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ping Pong is a game which has been in existence for many years and is basically played unchanged. The attempts in the past to modify the game have resulted in little improvement or change to the basic method of play. What is desired is an enhancement which challenges the skills of the players yet does not require new basic skill to be developed so that the experienced player is continued to be challenged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Numerous innovations for Illuminated Ping Pong have been provided in the prior art that are described as follows. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, they differ from the present invention as hereinafter contrasted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,541, issued on Jan. 30, 1996, titled Ping Pong Table Cover, invented by Ivan S. Dictor, and filed on Jun. 20, 1994, there is disclosed a cover for a regulation sized ping pong table in which a helical turns about a centrally support shaft the two ends of the cover are played out in opposite directions for attachment to cooperating opposite ends of the table to protect the playing area beneath the cover from weather elements, and wherein the length of the cover is of similar ping pong table regulation size so that it is in a taut condition, i.e. devoid of excess size to better promote gravity flow of rain therefrom as well as to provide resistance to wind gusts, and to have other utilitarian features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,056, issued on Jul. 24, 1990 titled Ping Pong Table Accessory Apparatus, invented by Kenin R. Bowers, filed on Feb. 27, 1989, a ping pong accessory for use with a ping pong table; wherein, the apparatus includes a rotatable ball rebound backboard unit and a plurality of pivoting sideboard units suspended from a movable support unit; whereby, the backboard unit and sideboard units maybe disposed at selected angles and orientations relative to one another and to the ping pong table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,241,716, issued on Dec. 30, 1980, titled Automatic Toy Gun for Ping Pong Balls, invented by Kwok W. Tsui, filed on Feb. 12, 1979, there is taught a toy gun simulating an automatic rifle adapted to shoot ping pong balls and comprising a pair of complementary molded hollow shells which are connectable along a central plane to form an elongated frame having a shoulder stock at the rear end, a short cylinder barrel at the forward end, a stationary support handle extending downward from said frame intermediately of the ends thereof a magazine extending upward and rearward from said barrel to hold a limited number of ping pong balls for discharge into said barrel, a firing ram supported by a guide device for reciprocation within the interior of the frame and having a ball-engaging member on the forward end and a head on the rearward end provided with a slot perpendicular to the path of the movement of the ram, a crank rotatably supported by one side of the frame and connected to a support rotatable therewith. The support has a crank pin positioned for movement in said slot, and a compression spring within the frame operable upon the firing ram to project the same forwardly to fire a ball from said barrel incident to the crank pin moving from the upper end of said slot in the head of the firing pin ram prior to the pin reaching its zenith of movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,227,508, issued Oct. 14, 1980, titled Toy Automatic Pistol for Ping Pong Balls, invented by Bruce M. D'Andrade, filed Dec. 22, 1978, a toy pistol is disclosed for shooting ping pong balls. The pistol includes a frame with a barrel portion at the forward end and a handle extending downward from the rearward end, a magazine extending upward and rearward therefrom, a ram moveable along longitudinal guide member in the frame rearward from said barrel portion, a compression spring to fire the ram forward, and a T-shaped combination trigger and sear having a head with a sear movable generally parallel to and below said guide members, the stem of said T-shaped member being movable into the forward portion of said handle and said head having pins on the opposite end movable in forward and rearward guide slots in the frame, the rearward slot exiting rearward and downward, whereby near the end of rearward movement of said T-shaped member the rear end of said head is moved downward to disengage the sear on said head from said ram which is fired forwardly by said compression spring and a tension spring automatically restores the T-shaped member forwardly to starting position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above patented inventions differ from the present invention because they fail to describe or claim at least one combination of the following features depicted in the present invention; a lighted paddle in combination with a lighted net flourescent painted ball and flourescent court lines.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is an unique enhancement to the game of ping pong. Lighted paddles and a lighted net are provided. Further a ping pong ball and court lines are flourescent materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The types of problems encountered in the prior art are limited enhancements to the game of ping pong.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the prior art, unsuccessful attempts to solve this problem were attempted namely: enhancements to the game consist of a cover provided to protect the table from the weather and a training device is provided to rebound and return the ball to the server when one player is practicing. However, the problem was solved by the present invention because an enhancement is provided for the players.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention solved a long felt need for an improvement to the game of ping pong.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide illuminated of the game equipment.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In keeping with these objects, and with others which will become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention resides, briefly stated, in paddles having a source of illumination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the Illuminated Ping Pong is designed in accordance with the present invention, lighted paddles and nets are combined with further flourescent ping pong balls and court lines to enhance the game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with another feature of the present invention, paddles have a power source contained within the handle controlled by an ON/OFF cap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another feature of the present invention is that the illumination means of the handle is a plurality of illuminator lights in the handle directed toward the paddle head so that the light falls on to the paddle head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Yet another feature of the present invention is that the net is supported on both ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still another feature of the present invention is that the net supports contain illuminators which direct light from an illumination source such as a light bulb on to the net.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Yet still another feature of the present invention is that the net supports have an ON/OFF switch to control the lights.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still yet another feature of the present invention is that the paddle head is manufacture from a light conductive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The novel features which are considered characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of the specific embodiments when read and understood in connection with the accompanying drawings.</div>
