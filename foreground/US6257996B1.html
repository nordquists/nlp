<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA72583961">
<div class="abstract">A game of two players using paddles to hit a ball against a roof. The roof has a pitch of approximately 6/12 with a front edge approximately eight feet above ground level. The roof having a length of approximately 50 feet and a height of approximately 25 feet. The roof must have either no gutters or have covers on the gutters. The serving player must stand approximately 12 feet from the front edge of the roof, and must hit the ball on one bounce while the returning player has up to three bounces to return the ball from any location. The game has foul out of bound shots if the ball bounces over the left roof edge, over the upper rear edge, and over the right edge of the roof. Additional foul shots are if the ball first lands on an edge or covered gutter of the roof on first bounce. Another foul is if either player extends their paddle over an edge of the roof at any time. A still another foul is if a player interferes with the other player by standing in front of the player whose turn is to hit the ball. Another foul is if the ball hits anything but the paddle head of the return player after coming off the roof(within bounds). All foul shots allow the non-fouling player to get either a point or the serve back. All moveable obstructions on the roof and ground playing area must be moved during play. Permanent roof obstructions such as chimneys and vents, and permanent ground obstructions such as trees although not desirable can be used during play. Skill can be achieved by hitting the ball of permanent roof obstructions, and making the other player run for the ball by hitting long, high and light shots. Failure to return a ball successfully achieves a single point for the other player. Games are won when one player has achieved at least ten points and at least two points more than the other player. The final winner is the first player to win three games.</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES54600369">
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to sports and games, and in particular to a method of playing a game between two players using paddles, a ball, and a roof.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Games such as handball, paddleball, tennis and the like have been played for many years. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,222,563 to Heftler et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,774 to Nankivell; U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,289 to McAllister; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,630,589 to Adie et al. However, each of these games generally requires elaborate courts and equipment and the like, in order to be properly played.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,048 to Kienle describes a garage roof party game that can be played on a roof. However, the game uses traps that must be positioned on the roof that can be both difficult and dangerous to position and move. Additionally, Kienle does not offer the speed and agility of the court games previously described. A web site named “www.roofball.com” and another site entitled “www.gedcities.com/capitolhill/lobby/7049/ “ describe similar roof games. However, both of these games have very general and loose rules. For example, both games rely on only using one's hand to hit the ball once. Additionally, both games are very loose as to the specific types of roofs that can be used, and can be played on roofs of most shapes and sizes. Additionally, most roofs have obstructions thereon such as chimineys, and the like. Additionally, most roofs have gutters that can obstruct and redirect the balls. Thus these roof games are played on roofs that do not have any uniformity as to playing fields. Thus, these roof games would not allow players to compete fairly at different locations. For example, players using a low roof would have advantages over players using a steep high roof. Players having greater pitched roofs would play differently than roofs having a low pitch. The lack of consistent and uniform rules in both games would not allow the games to be fairly played for nationwide leagues, and the like.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first objective of the present invention is to provide a game that uses a roof as a playing surface for two players using paddles and a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second object of this invention is to provide for a roof game where the roof has a uniform pitch with no obstructions, and where gutters are either eliminated or covered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A preferred embodiment A roofball game includes a roof having a 6/12 pitch with no moveable obstructions, with a ground plane in front of the roof having no moveable ground obstructions, a tennis ball, two players each carrying two paddles at least two players. The roof has either no gutters or covered gutters. Each paddle has a longitudinal grip of approximately 5 to 6 inches long, and a paddle head having a width of approximately 5 inches, a height of approximately 12 inches, and a thickness of approximately ¾ of an inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The rectangular roof playing surface has upper and front edges of approximately 50 feet across, left and rightside edges of approximately 25 feet with the front edge of the roof being approximately 8 feet from ground level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The players decide who will first serve, which can be done by a coin toss. One player keeps serving until they either create a foul or fail to return a shot. The game is played by serving a ball from the first paddle of the first player to the pitched roof surface, bouncing the ball off the pitched roof surface to a location in front of a front edge of the roof surface to a second player having a second paddle, and having the second player returning the ball to the pitched roof surface with the second paddle. The server stands approximately 12 feet in front of a midportion of the front of the roof and hits the serving ball on one bounce off the first paddle. The returning player must hit the returning ball to the roof on no more than three bounces off the second paddle. Players can lose their serve or lose a point by fouling the ball. Either player interfering with the other player's shot such as standing in front of the player whose time is to hit the ball can cause a foul. Another foul occurs if either player extends their paddle over any edge of the roof. Still another foul can occur if the hit ball first lands on a gutter/roof edge on first bounce. Still another foul is if a player causes the hit ball to bounce over any edge of the roof except for the front edge. The play of an individual game continues until one of the players achieves at least ten points and is at least two points greater than the other player's score. The final winner is the first player to win three games</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Before explaining the disclosed embodiment of the present invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the particular arrangement shown since the invention is capable of other embodiments. Also, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a roof <b>1</b> for playing the subject game. Referring to FIG. 1, The official Roofball™ roof <b>10</b> has a 6/12 pitch, with fiberglass shingles, no roof obstructions, and no ground obstacles. The official roof does not have gutters nor windows below. It's front edge <b>18</b> can be approximately 8 feet high from the ground and be approximately 50 feet long between side edges <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>. The width from the front edge <b>18</b> to the rear ridge <b>14</b> is approximately 25 feet. Many roofs do not meet these requirements, so that the subject game is playable on a limited number of roofs. Gutters can be part of the roof in play, but most gutters will eventually catch the ball as it is slowly rolling off the roof. If the playing roof has gutters, then gutter covers <b>6</b> that are made for the purpose of keeping out leaves can be used to cover the gutters <b>4</b> and can be effective for keeping out the ball from the gutters <b>4</b>. If the roof has a gutter and play runs without a cover, the rule is that if the ball stops and becomes stuck within a gutter, the play is repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a view of two players <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A playing the novel game against the roof <b>10</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>. Each game of Roofball™ can be played to a total of ten points. But there must always be a two-point spread to win. The final winner is the player who wins three games first. When serving the ball one only has to hit the ball once with the Roofball™ paddle <b>10</b>A, <b>20</b>A up onto the roof <b>10</b>. The server <b>1</b>A must serve from a position that is center with the roof <b>10</b> (approximately midway with 25 feet to each side edge of the roof edges <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>) and at least approximately 12 feet in front of the front of the roof edge <b>18</b>. One must always get the serve first before they can get any points in the game. S<b>1</b> is the direction of ball <b>30</b> being served.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 shows a player <b>2</b>A attempting to return a serve from the serving player <b>1</b>A of FIG. 2 driving the ball <b>30</b> in the direction of arrow S<b>2</b>. The ball <b>30</b> is successfully served or returned if it does not roll or bounce over the peak <b>14</b> or over the sides <b>12</b>, <b>16</b> of the roof. The ball <b>30</b> can only come off the front edge <b>18</b> of the roof. The server <b>1</b>A can lose their serve or a point if the ball <b>30</b> does not come off the front edge <b>18</b> or even reach the roof <b>10</b> when serving or returning the ball <b>30</b>. If the ball <b>30</b> comes off a front corner <b>13</b> of the roof and there is a disagreement as to which side of the corner it went off of, then the play is repeated, or the decision can be made by a referee if present. If the ball <b>30</b> comes off the side <b>12</b> of the roof, out of bounds, the player <b>2</b>A has the option of continuing to play by returning the ball <b>30</b>. If the player <b>2</b>A chooses to do so, then out of bounds can not be called once the ball <b>30</b> is hit with the paddle <b>20</b>A. If the ball <b>30</b> goes over the peak <b>14</b>, then the player <b>2</b>A does not have the option of returning the ball <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 shows the opponent <b>2</b>A returning the ball <b>30</b> to the roof <b>10</b> in the direction of arrow R<b>1</b> with their paddle <b>20</b>A. After the serve, the opponent <b>2</b>A must retrieve the ball <b>30</b> with the Roofball™ paddle <b>20</b>A(which will be described in greater detail in reference to FIGS. 13A-13B) and successfully return it to the roof <b>10</b> with no more than three bounces off the paddle <b>20</b>A. When retrieving the ball <b>30</b> you must wait until the ball <b>30</b> comes off the front edge <b>18</b> of the roof <b>10</b> before one can use their paddle <b>10</b>A. The ball can not hit the ground G, one's body or anything else. Therefore the ball can only hit the paddle head. Contact anywhere else is considered to be a foul with the same penalities as other fouls described herein. If a player catches the ball <b>30</b> with their paddle rather than bouncing it, the opponent will get the point or serve. This is also the case if the ball hits the ground G, or hits anything else other than one's paddle head while in play. The ball <b>30</b> can only hit the servers paddle once when serving and no more than three times by the opponent when returning the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 shows a player <b>2</b>A moving out of the way of their opponent <b>1</b>A when hitting the ball <b>30</b> in the direction of arrow R<b>2</b>. After a player <b>2</b>A returns the ball <b>30</b> to the roof <b>10</b> they must always get out of the way of their opponent <b>1</b>A. The opponent <b>2</b>A can always call interference if the other player has impeded their opponents attempted return by standing in the way or bumping into each other. If interference is called then the play is repeated. But it must be called immediately after the interference, and not after a player discovers their attempted return is going to fail. If interference is not called the ball continues to be played. If there is a referee present then only he or she can call or not call the interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6 shows an illegal foul of extending a roofball paddle <b>10</b>A/<b>20</b>A over a roof line edge <b>18</b>. Players can not extend their paddles <b>10</b>A/<b>20</b>A over any portion of the roof <b>10</b> in any way. Otherwise, play height would create an unfair advantage. The ball <b>30</b> must completely come off the front edge <b>18</b> of the roof <b>10</b> before the other player can attempt a return. If this foul happens, the other player gets the point or serve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 7 shows another foul maneuver of a ball <b>30</b> initially landing a roof edge/gutter <b>4</b> on a serve or return. When returning or serving the ball onto the roof, the ball's first landing must land 100% on the roof. It can not hit the roof's edge or gutter until after the first landing. If the ball hits the roof edge and or gutter first when serving or returning, this is a foul and the other player gets the point or serve. The ball <b>30</b> can bounce from the roof <b>10</b> to the roof edge/gutter <b>4</b> to remain in play, but not vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 8 shows additional fouls where the played ball <b>30</b> is hit out of bounds in the direction of arrow O<b>1</b> over the left roof edge <b>12</b>, in the direction of arrow O<b>2</b> over the top roof edge <b>14</b>, and in the direction of arrow O<b>3</b> over the right roof edge <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9 shows the played ball <b>30</b> hitting a fixed obstruction <b>40</b> on the roof. If the roof playing field has fixed obstructions <b>40</b> such as vents, chimneys and the like, then the obstructions are part of the play. The obstructions <b>40</b> can be used to a player's advantage by causing the ball to bounce into the opposite direction, hopefully within bounds. Ground obstacles <b>45</b> can be dangerous. A good playing area will have minimal or no ground obstacles <b>45</b> such as trees. Ground obstacles <b>45</b>, similar to roof obstructions <b>40</b>, become part of the play, in that if a tree <b>45</b> prevented a player from getting to the ball <b>30</b> in time or at all, this is the player's loss. Players are responsible for removing all and nonpermanent objects from the playing area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Additional playing field requirements will now be described. Players should always play off a roof that is not facing a street. A roof facing the back yard of a home is generally the best playing area, unless there are some potentially dangerous ground obstructions. Players should always seek out a “good roof” and a safe playing area to enjoy the game as it is meant to be played. Ultimately, the best approach is to have an official roof platform constructed on an open playing area with no obstructions or obstacles. The official Roofball ground surface for the court area is grass, and is clear of obstacles for even distant returns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Players should always be cognizant of the closest windows in the playing area. Windows can be subject to damage if a return is grossly miscalculated. Since players are strategically trying to balance and place the ball, there are no power serves or slam-dunks in this game, only smart thinking, coordination and the ability to run. This is why strength or large size is not a factor as so many sports require. An official Roofball™ roof does not have end walls, and thus no windows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another important factor is to play at times that the sun is not at an angle which can be a hindrance to the players vision when playing. UV protected sunglasses are recommended at all times. Additional nonbreakable sunglasses offer good protection as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 10 shows a preferred chaser hit for use in the novel game. The “Chaser” is a useful pointer for play. The best strategy is to keep one's opponent running at all the times. By hitting the ball <b>30</b> from adjacent to one end <b>16</b> to the other roof end <b>12</b> will be keep one's opponent off balance and short on energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 11 shows a preferred “Highball” bounce off the roof. If a player <b>1</b>A is good, the player can hit the ball <b>30</b> very high without missing the roof <b>10</b>. The advantage is that once it bounces off the roof(roof bounce) it will send the opponent <b>2</b>A running backwards making the return much harder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 12 shows a preferred lightball hit off the roof. A very tricky move is to return the ball <b>30</b> softly so that is lands, near the roof's edge <b>18</b>, so that the opponent <b>2</b>A is forced to run quickly to return the ball <b>30</b>. However, the initiating player must be sure to get out of the way quickly to avoid an interference call.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13A is a front view of a preferred paddle <b>100</b> for the novel game. FIG. 13B is a side view of the paddle of FIG. 13A along arrow Y. The official Roofball™ paddle <b>10</b>A/<b>20</b>A can be constructed of wood or plastic. The handle <b>120</b> itself can vary to suit the player and can be approximately 5 to approximately 6 inches long and rounded with optional rubber gripping surface. The paddle head <b>110</b> can be approximately 12 inches in length and 5 inches wide. Thickness will vary according to the weight and density of the wood, and plastic used, but no thicker than approximately ¾ of an inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The official ball <b>30</b> shown in previous Figures to use in the game of Roofball™ can be a tennis ball. When using the Roofball™ paddle <b>100</b> (FIGS. 13A-13B) other balls are harder to control than a tennis ball <b>30</b>. For the way Roofball™ is played and the shape and dimensions of the paddle <b>100</b>, the tennis ball <b>30</b> is the best for the proper bounce, hitting and control. Players are recommended to use a new or fairly new tennis ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other equipment such as but not limited to gloves can be used. Gloves can be used to hold the handles of the paddles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the preferred embodiment describes a physical game of skill, the invention can be done in other mediums such as but not limited to video sports games, arcade games, virtual reality games, simulation games, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the invention has been described, disclosed, illustrated and shown in various terms of certain embodiments or modifications which it has presumed in practice, the scope of the invention is not intended to be, nor should it be deemed to be, limited thereby and such other modifications or embodiments as may be suggested by the teachings herein are particularly reserved especially as they fall within the breadth and scope of the claims here appended.</div>
