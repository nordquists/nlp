<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This application claims priority from US provisional application No. 60/232,799, filed Sep. 15, 2000, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the past, games such as squash, badminton, table tennis, tennis, and/or racket ball have utilized rackets for players to score points within a game. In these games, scoring has occurred by forcing an opponent to miss a shot where each missed shot either transferred service or the missed shot was counted as a point for a serving player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other types of racket games are known where the goal of the game is to count consecutive hits by a player for as long a period of time as possible. Games of this type are kadima and/or matkot which focus on team cooperation to improve scoring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A problem with the counting games as known is the concentration required to consecutively hit a ball while simultaneously accurately counting the number of hits. An individual focusing or concentrating on striking a ball frequently loses count of the exact number of consecutive hits. An individual concentrating on accurately counting the number hits frequently fails to provide sufficient concentration to strike a ball resulting in a missed shot and the end of the game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In light of the above it would be desirable to provide a racket or paddle device which simultaneously counts consecutive hits and audibly recites and/or records the number of consecutive hits which have occurred during a period of the use of the racket.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">As indicated above the present invention is directed to a counting racket, indicated generally at <b>10</b> in FIG. 1, which may be configured to count and audibly recite the number of times the racket <b>10</b> strikes an object such as for example, a game ball <b>12</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 2, an embodiment of the racket <b>10</b> is shown wherein the racket <b>10</b> is configured for single player use. When configured for single player use, the racket <b>10</b> may be provided with ball <b>12</b> which is secured to the racket face <b>14</b> by an elastic cord <b>16</b>. The elastic cord <b>16</b> may be releasably attached to the racket <b>10</b>, to allow the racket <b>10</b> to be converted from single player to multiple player use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The racket <b>10</b> shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 is comprises a racket assembly <b>60</b> which is made up of a handle <b>50</b>, a throat <b>52</b>, and a paddle or racket face <b>14</b>. The racket assembly <b>60</b> houses various electronic components, indicated generally at <b>15</b> in FIG. 3, which are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The racket <b>10</b> includes a controller <b>18</b> such as a microprocessor, shown in FIG. 3, which consecutively counts signals as generated by an acoustic sensor <b>20</b> which detects consecutive strikes of the ball <b>12</b> upon the racket face <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the controller <b>18</b> accesses a second algorithm which signals alternative counts as generated by the acoustic sensor <b>20</b>, representing either an odd or even number of consecutive strikes between two players, thereby allowing opponents using rackets of the present invention to keep individual scores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As indicated above, the counting racket <b>10</b> may be provided with an acoustic sensor <b>20</b> utilized to detect strikes upon a racket <b>10</b> by a ball <b>12</b>. Alternatively the acoustic sensor may be some other type of sensor such as a contact sensor which detects the impact of the ball <b>12</b> by its force of impact on the racket face <b>14</b> rather than by detecting the acoustic energy or sound of the impact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The counting racket <b>10</b> also preferably includes a speaker <b>22</b> which may be used to audibly announce consecutive strikes upon the racket <b>10</b>. The speaker <b>22</b> may also be used to audibly announce words and/or phrases as generated by a speech processor <b>24</b> which may be programmed for a variety of languages. The phrases generated by the speech processor <b>24</b> may be of any nature. Typically such phrases will be motivational, provide encouragement, or they may even be sarcastic, and/or humorous. The words and/or phrases recited by the speech processor <b>24</b> may be selected, modified or provided at the preference of an individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Audible numbers announced by the speaker <b>22</b> may be preferably stored within a vocal database <b>26</b> which simultaneously stores the audible speech during use of the counting racket. The controller <b>18</b> is preferably provided within the counting racket <b>10</b> to control the access of signals for generation of the recognizable audible numbers from the speech processor <b>24</b> representative of the counts as recorded by the acoustic sensor <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1, the counting racket preferably also includes a plurality of switches <b>30</b> in electronic communication with the controller <b>18</b>. An first switch <b>32</b> for starting of a game, a mode switch <b>34</b> for selecting a one or two player mode, a mute switch <b>36</b> for turning the sound on or off, a score switch <b>38</b> which will signal the controller <b>18</b> to state or repeat a recorded score, and/or a high score switch <b>40</b> which will signal the controller to retrieve the highest score as stored within a memory or electronic counter <b>42</b> for communication to an individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The counting racket <b>10</b> may also include an electronic counter <b>42</b> which is in communication with the acoustic sensor <b>20</b> to record and translate acoustic signals as generated during the striking of a ball <b>12</b> upon the racket face <b>14</b> of the racket <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, the acoustic sensor <b>20</b> hears the ball <b>12</b> striking the face <b>14</b> of the racket <b>10</b> and generates a signal. The signal from the acoustic sensor <b>20</b> is received by a signal processor <b>44</b> which emits a digital signal for transmission to the electronic counter <b>42</b>. The electronic counter <b>42</b> advances the count by either an increment of one, two, or by some other value, according to the preselected mode as activated by the mode switch <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As indicated above, the electric counter <b>42</b> also has a high score memory access which stores a hall of fame or high score for comparison to the current game for an individual. The hall of fame or high score is preferably stored within the electronic memory or storage unit to be compared to the best score achieved during any particular game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The electronic counter <b>42</b> preferably generates a signal, where the signal is transmitted to the signal processor <b>44</b>. The processor <b>44</b> in turn, compares the signal to the best score as stored within the memory of the counter <b>42</b> for placement as appropriate. The signal processor <b>44</b> also sends a signal to the vocal database <b>26</b> for selection of an audible signal. The signal processor <b>44</b> further sends a signal to the speaker <b>22</b> for generation of an audible signal representative of the consecutive hits. The signal as retrieved from the database <b>26</b> of signals is preferably an audible number which corresponds to the number of hits detected. Alternatively, a predetermined phrase may be substituted for, or provided in addition to the audible number.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The speech processor <b>24</b> receives a signal from the signal processor <b>44</b> or electronic counter <b>42</b> and converts the electric signal into a verbal or audible score. The verbal or audible score is transmitted through the speaker <b>22</b> for detection by an individual. An individual may receive a high score by activation of the high score button or switch <b>40</b> where the signal for the high score is retrieved by the electric counter <b>42</b> from memory for audible generation by the speech processor <b>24</b> and speaker <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As may best be seen in FIG. 1, the counting racket <b>10</b> is preferably formed of rugged plastic and/or wooden material. The racket includes a handle <b>50</b> which is preferably formed of rugged plastic material having an internal cavity which is adapted to receivingly engage the electronic components of the racket namely: the controller <b>18</b> and a power source <b>46</b>. Other components as have been discussed herein may also be housed in the handle <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The racket <b>10</b> may also include a throat <b>52</b>. The throat <b>52</b> extends from handle <b>50</b> to engage the racket face <b>14</b>. The throat <b>52</b> is preferably also formed of sturdy plastic and/or wooden material and is adapted for receiving engagement of the acoustic sensor <b>20</b>, speaker <b>22</b>, and at least one switch <b>30</b>. Electrical contacts and/or wires preferably provide electronic communication between the various electronic components such as the controller <b>18</b>, power source <b>46</b>, acoustic sensor <b>20</b>, speaker <b>22</b>, and at least one switch <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The power source <b>46</b> for the counting racket <b>10</b> is preferably batteries which may be releasably secured within the handle <b>50</b> via a screw access panel <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The counting racket <b>10</b> also preferably includes a sleep mode which deactivates and terminates power to the electrical components when the acoustic sensor <b>20</b> does not receive a signal from a ball strike for a predetermined period of time, such as for example, approximating three minutes.</div>
