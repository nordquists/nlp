<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This invention related to structures known as bats, racquets, paddles, or blades for use in ball games.</div>
<heading>INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Consider that a table tennis racquet is a paddle equipped with sheets of rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Table tennis is a very popular sporting event in which a racquet is used to hit table tennis balls. The effectiveness of hitting a ball depends on the grip of a table tennis racquet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">It is well-known that there are two major grips: handshake and penhold. Each of them has its well-known advantages and disadvantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The penhold's advantage: a forehand offensive topspin stroke is more effective with a penhold grip instead of the handshake grip. This is because a player using the penhold grip can hold the racquet with the blade angled down and backwards with a great extent before the stroke.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The penhold's disadvantage: the difficulty to execute backhand offensive strokes. Not many world-class players use the backhand side of their racquets for offensive strokes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The handshake advantage: it allows to a player execute good backhand offensive strokes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The handshake disadvantage: forehand strokes are not so effective to compare with the penhold grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">There is a known penhold grip (hereinafter the “1+4 grip”) where the thumb is positioned along the forehand side of a racquet and the other remaining fingers are positioned on the backhand side. This grip allows for good offensive strokes on the forehand and backhand sides but this grip also has its disadvantages</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The disadvantages of the 1+4 grip: the unsecure grip does not allow for fast hits or spin, and therefore it is not possible to produce strong attacks. The grip is also uncomfortable because the fingers on the backhand side of the racquet have nothing to hold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">From the above it is clear that a need exists for a racquet that has a handle(s) that allows for a novel, comfortable and secure grip with the blade down and backwards, for both forehand and backhand offensive strokes.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The present invention eliminates all of the above disadvantages. A two-handle paddle (the blade one and the side one) provides a player with a great secure grip similar to the 1+4 grip which combines the main advantages of the penhold and the handshake grips, without their respective disadvantages present, or other disadvantages arising. This novel grip has a very high surface of contact of the hand and paddle and increases the feel of the paddle. In addition, the handles are structured and positioned on the blade in allowing a player to have a comfortable wrist position with a more secure grip compared with conventional paddles and their ability to produce very powerful forehand and backhand strokes with a relaxed hand.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Rubber covers both striking sides of the blade <b>8</b> and the blade <b>8</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) but they are not shown. Both embodiments provide a secure grip for a right-handed player. The paddle for left-handed player would be a mirror image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Hereinafter, if a figure is not mentioned, then the part is best shown on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The first embodiment on the figures from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that the paddle consists of five part: a blade <b>8</b>, a side handle <b>6</b>, a blade handle <b>16</b>, a plate <b>2</b> and a cover <b>17</b>. All of the parts could be made of wood, plywood, plastic or other materials that the game rules allow. They could be made as one piece or could be assembled using separate parts. These parts, for example, could be glued with the blade <b>8</b>. The side handle <b>6</b> is fixed on the backhand side of the blade <b>8</b>. An angle <b>10</b> between the midline <b>9</b> of the backhand side of the blade <b>8</b> and the intersection <b>13</b> of the left side <b>14</b> of the side handle <b>6</b> with the backhand side of the blade <b>6</b> is 68 degrees. The angle <b>10</b> could be in a range between 15 degrees and 160 degrees. The blade <b>8</b> is extended as the blade handle <b>16</b>. A plate <b>2</b> is added to the backhand side of the blade handle <b>16</b>. An angle <b>15</b> between the intersection <b>13</b> and a line <b>4</b> of the blade handle <b>16</b> is 80 degrees. The angle <b>15</b> could be in a range between 45 degrees and 150 degrees. The blade handle <b>16</b> has a cover <b>17</b> on its forehand side. The thickness of the cover <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) could be in a range between 0.2 mm and 25 mm but the best thickness is 4 mm. The plate <b>2</b>, the blade handle <b>16</b> and the cover <b>17</b> look like the shaft of a conventional racquet and the sum of the thicknesses of these parts is 25 mm for the best grip by the thumb and the index finger. This thickness could be in a range between 7 mm and 80 mm. The cover <b>17</b> protects the surface of the forehand side of the blade handle <b>8</b>. In a possible embodiment, there would be no cover <b>17</b>. For good racquet feel while hitting a ball, there is a counterbalance of the blade with the rubber. The counterbalance consists of three parts: the blade handle <b>16</b>, a part of the plate <b>2</b>, and a part of the cover <b>17</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the side handle <b>6</b> that has the best configuration for the most secure grip that allows play with a semi-relaxed hand and wrist. The side handle <b>6</b> has four gripping parts: two walls <b>5</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4) and 11</figref> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a left side <b>14</b>, and a bridge that connected the walls with the left side <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the thumb holds the rubber on the forehand side of the blade <b>8</b> and the cover <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the index finger holds the plate <b>2</b> along the way such that the blade <b>8</b>, the plate, and the cover <b>17</b> are above the hand. The index finger could contact the upper gripping wall <b>5</b> of the side handle <b>6</b>. The middle finger, the ring finger and the little fingers are positioned inside a cavity created with the blade <b>8</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the gripping bridge of the side handle <b>6</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The middle finger could contact with the gripping wall <b>5</b> and the little finger could contact both the gripping wall <b>11</b> and inside the side handle <b>6</b>. Therfore, the thumb and the index finger hold the cover <b>17</b> and the plate <b>2</b> as one handle and the remaining fingers hold the side handle <b>6</b> as another handle. The angle <b>10</b> is less then 90 degrees and because of this the blade <b>8</b> is angled down and backwards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">This is very important for producing good forehand and backhand offensive strokes with the hand of the player in a comfortable position. The angle <b>15</b> is less then 90 degrees and that provides a player with a very secure grip of the side handle <b>6</b> and the blade handle <b>16</b>. For a more secure grip, the side handle <b>6</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) could be positioned toward the blade handle <b>8</b> <i>a</i>. The edge <b>7</b> of the side handle <b>6</b> is parallel to the edge <b>12</b>. But, they do not have to be parallel. For example, because the middle finger is longer than the little finger, the upper edge of the gripping wall <b>5</b> could be made longer then the upper edge of the gripping wall <b>11</b>. Also, the edge <b>7</b> does not have to be straight. It could be rounded along itself or it could have three rounded areas to accommodate the three fingers. In the first embodiment, the edge <b>12</b> of the side handle <b>6</b> is parallel to the blade <b>8</b>. This allows a player to use both the forehand and the backhand sides of the paddle with equal effectiveness. But the edge <b>12</b> does not have to be parallel to the blade <b>8</b>. If the gripping wall <b>11</b> is higher than the gripping wall <b>5</b>, then the paddle (meaning that the hand of a player has the same position) is more open for forehand offensive strokes and more closed for backhand offensive strokes. In this case, this is better to produce backhand offensive strokes. And vice versa if the gripping wall <b>5</b> is higher than the wall <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The gripping bridge of the side handle <b>6</b> is not parallel to the blade <b>8</b> but it could be parallel or the edge <b>7</b> could be closer to the blade <b>8</b> then the edge <b>12</b>. Edge <b>12</b>, as well as line <b>13</b>, does not have to be straight; one of them could be curved. The cross section of the side handle <b>6</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) does not eliminate other possible configurations of the side handle. The cross section of the side handle could be “I” formed as in the second embodiment or it could be “L” or “T” formed. Also, it could be any combination of the above-mentioned shapes. The different side handles could be perpendicular to the blade <b>8</b>, as in the second embodiment, but instead of 90 degrees, there could be a different angle between the blade and the side handle. It is obvious that all the above modifications are in the scope of the present invention.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> show the second embodiment of the novel paddle. The midline of the blade handle <b>18</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) coincides with the midline <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>8</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The side handle <b>6</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is made as one piece and its left side is rounded for a better fit with the hand. A grip for using the novel paddle according with the second embodiment is similar to the grip in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">With respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, include variations in size, materials, shapes, form, assembly and grip, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</div>
