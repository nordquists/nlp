<div class="description-paragraph">SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 702,697, dated June 17, 1902. Application filed April 9,1902- $erial No. 102,021 (No model.) </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To all whom it may concern/.- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that I, EMILE BOULANGER, of the city of St. Louis, State of Missouri, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in House-Tennis Rackets, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming a part hereof- My invention relates to house-tennis rackets; and it consists of the novel features herein shown, described, and claimed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> My object is to construct an improved house-tennis racket; and my invention consists of the combination, with an ordinary house-tennis racket having the usual frame and a rawhide cover stretched upon the frame, of a suitable stay extending from the handle outwardly to the opposite side of the frame. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 is a side elevation. Fig. 2 is a central longitudinal section. Fig. 3 is a view analogous to Fig. 2 and showing a modification. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to the drawings in detail, my invention consists of the combination, with an ordinary house-tennis racket having the handle 4, the bow 5, extending from the handle, and the rawhide heads 6 and 7 stretched upon the bow, of the stay 8, attached to the forward end of the handle and extending outwardly between the rawhide heads and attached to the opposite side of the bow from the handle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the preferred construction a wire is passed outwardly through an opening 9 and' elongating, adds greatly to its stifiness and durability, and prevents wrinkling of the heads. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">. In the modification shown in Fig. 3 a rod 12 is inserted entirely through an-opening 13 in the outer part of the bow and passed through an opening 14 in the handle, and the adjusting-nut 15 is placed upon the end of the rod, so that the rod may be tightened or loosened, as desired. I claim- The improvement in house-tennis rackets, comprising the combination with'an ordinary house-tennis racket, having the usual frame and'a rawhide cover stretched upon the frame; of a suitable stay extending from'the handle outwardly to the opposite side of the frame, substantially as specified. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In testimony whereof I affix my signature in presence of two witnesses. </div>
