<div class="description-paragraph">ARNOLD BECKER, OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">RACKET. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">.SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 7 03,519, dated July 1, 1902. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Application sled April '17, 1902. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">T0 all wwm/ it may concern: Y </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Beit known that I, ARNOLD BECKER, a citizen of the United States,'residing at Seattle, in the county of King and VState of vWashington, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Rackets, of which the following is a specification, reference' being had'therein to the accompanying drawing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> My invention relates to rackets or bats used in playing games such" as table-tennis and ping-pong. The rackets used for indoor games of this character have heretofore been made with smooth wood or vellum strikingsurfaces, necessitating the ball being struck direct or nearly perpendicular to the surface of the bat in order to serve or return the same. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The object of my invention is to provide a cheap and effective coveringto the racketsurface, whereby plays may be accomplished unattainable with any other rackets which have come to my notice. Such end I attain by the construction hereinafter described, and illustrated in the accompanying drawing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to the said drawing, which is a perspective view of a racket provided with my improvement, the letter a represents the blade, and b the handle, forming the racketstock. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To the opposite faces of the blade I apply a granulated coating c, such as emery, sand, or sawdust. Any adhesive compound-such as shellac, cement, paste, or glue-may be used to put on the coating, and after being dried or set an outer coating of shellac or paint is preferably applied. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The coating cneed not be formed upon th racket-blade itself, but may as well be ap- Serial No. 103,263. (No model.) </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The results produced by my improved coat l ing or covering for raekets are obvious. It </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> is apparent that rackets provided with either will,on account of their rough surfaces, enable ythe playerto return the ball by a side cut of vthe racket and cause the ball to rotate rapidly in its Hight, so that when it strikes the table it will rebound at an unexpected angle, to the confusion of his opponent. Further, the ball when struck by the racket does not easily slide upon the rough surface of the same,even when held at a considerable angle. Furthermore, in rapid playing with a racket having a rough surface it takes a better hold, so to speak, ofthe ball, and consequently permits greater accuracy in delivering the ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> What Iclaim as new, and desire to secure by Letters'Patent, is- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. A racket Whereon is applied a granular substance wherebythe blade-surface thereof is roughened,1for therpurpose described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. In a racket, the combination with the stock, of a sheet or sheets of paper, or the like, having a coating of granular substance applied thereto, and said coating, substan tially as and for the purpose described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In testimony whereof I affix my signature in presence of two witnesses. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">ARNOLD BECKER. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Witnesses: </div>
