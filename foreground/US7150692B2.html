<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to a sport good, and more particularly to a sport good, which is made of a composite material and has both properties of lighter weight and greater rigidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Each sport has its specific goods, such as hockey stick, golf club, baseball bat, Ping-Pong bat, tennis or badminton racket and so on. These goods usually have a hollow member for reduction of weight, such that the user can use it easily, but the hollow member also reduces the rigidity thereof, which means the hollow member is easier to be deformed when swings it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The manufacturers of the sport goods are trying to design the sport good with both of lighter weight and greater rigidity. Most of them are provided with extra structure to increase the rigidity thereof, but the cost thereof is raised and the extra structure increases the weight still. There is no such a design can get the sport goods with both of the lighter weight and greater rigidity.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a sport good, which has both properties of lighter weight and greater rigidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">According to the objective of the present invention, a sport good comprises a rigid member made of a composite material. The rigid member has a chamber therein, in which a high-pressure gas is filled.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sport good of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention is a hockey stick <b>10</b>, which has a shaft <b>11</b> and a blade <b>12</b>. The shaft <b>11</b> is a hollow rigid member and made of a composite material having a chamber <b>14</b> therein. The blade <b>12</b> is connected to an end of the shaft <b>11</b> and on the other end of the shaft, an opening is provided to be communicated with the chamber <b>14</b> and a plunger <b>13</b> is provided in the opening. The plunger <b>13</b> has an airway <b>131</b>, in which a check valve <b>132</b> is provided. Gas is issued into the chamber <b>14</b> via the airway <b>131</b> of the plunger <b>13</b> and the check valve <b>132</b> prevents the chamber <b>14</b> from leakage. The chamber <b>14</b> is inflated with the gas until it has a predetermined pressure in the chamber <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The shaft <b>11</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b> filled with the high-pressure gas has a greater rigidity and keeps the lighter weight still. The inventor tests the relationship of the pressure in the chamber <b>14</b> and the rigidity of the shaft <b>11</b> and the test is described hereunder. A table <b>90</b> is provided, which has a rail <b>91</b> thereon, two frame <b>92</b> on the rail <b>91</b> and two clip devices <b>93</b> are provided on a top of each of the frame <b>92</b>. The table <b>90</b> further has an arm <b>94</b> on a center of a top of the rail <b>91</b> and a sensor (not shown) to sense the pressure of the exertion of the arm <b>94</b> and the displacement of the arm <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In the beginning of the test, the frames <b>92</b> are adjusted to have a suitable interval to put the shaft <b>11</b> therebetween and clip it by the clip devices clip <b>93</b>, and then the arm <b>94</b> is aligned to the center of shaft <b>11</b> and to the centers of the frames <b>94</b> as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Operator sets the pressure of the arm <b>94</b> and the arm <b>94</b> presses the shaft <b>11</b> to make a deformation of the shaft <b>11</b>. The sensor measures the displacement of the arm <b>94</b>, which is identical to the deformation of the shaft <b>11</b>, to have the valve of the deformation of the shaft <b>11</b>. The arm <b>94</b> presses the shaft until a specific deformation of the shaft is arrived, and then records the valve of the arm. The arm <b>94</b> presses the shafts with/without high-pressure gas therein and the values of the pressure of the arm are listed in the table hereunder:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">According to the table, the shaft with high-pressure gas has a greater resistance to the pressure than the shaft without high-pressure gas, which means the shaft with high-pressure gas has a greater rigidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a Ping-Pong bat <b>20</b> consisted of a paddle <b>21</b> and a handle <b>22</b>. The bat <b>20</b> is made of carbon-fibre composite material into a rigid member and has a chamber <b>23</b> therein. A high-pressure gas is issued in the chamber <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the third preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a baseball bat <b>20</b> consisted with a bat portion <b>31</b> and a handle portion <b>32</b>, in which a chamber <b>33</b> is formed and a high-pressure gas is filled therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The sport goods illustrated in the above preferred embodiments are a few examples, any sport goods, such as golf club, tennis racket, badminton racket, ski stick and so on, which needs properties of lighter weight and greater rigidity, can inflate high-pressure gas in the chamber thereof as described above. The sport good could be provided with a plurality of independent chambers therein and each chamber is issued with high-pressure gas.</div>
