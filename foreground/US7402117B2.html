<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a racket with a center of gravity thereof approximate to a center of a rubber sheet of the racket, and especially to a racket whose center of gravity moves approximately to the center of rubber sheet and is located in a high ball-strike area, thereby enhancing attack and defense abilities of the racket, and reducing shock.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref> illustrate a conventional racket. A head <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> of the racket is substantially square-shaped (racket <b>1</b>), or is substantially circular-shaped (racket <b>2</b>). The rackets <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> comprise blades <b>11</b>, <b>22</b> and rubber sheets <b>14</b>, <b>24</b>. The blades <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> comprise heads <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>, necks <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> and handles <b>13</b>, <b>23</b>. The rubber sheets <b>14</b>, <b>24</b> are attached on the heads <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. A connecting line connecting two outermost points of the heads <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> (line connecting two respective outermost points of two sides of the head) is positioned substantially in a front end of a rear half portion of the heads <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>. The centers of gravity <b>101</b>, <b>201</b> are positioned in a place substantially adjacent to rear ends of the rubber sheets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Almost all of the strike points are located in the front end and the middle of the heads <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> (that is, the high ball-strike area is in the two front L/3), and the balls struck in the two portions are far from the centers of gravity <b>101</b>, <b>201</b>. Thus, from a physics point of view, the rackets <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> generate relatively bigger rotational forces. Bigger rotational forces cause the greater shocks, and greater force is required to strike the balls. Hitting a high-energy ball is thus difficult, and may even lack a better ball hit feel and interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Therefore, how to make the centers of gravity <b>101</b>, <b>201</b> move into the high ball-strike area (for example, making the centers of gravity approximate to the center <b>141</b> of the rubber sheet) is a desired object of the present invention.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a racket with a center of gravity approximate to a center of a rubber sheet, in which the center of gravity approaches the center of the rubber availably. In other works, the center of gravity of the racket is moved into a high ball-strike area, thereby hitting more high-energy balls to improve attack, decreasing a chance of losing a ball to a firm defense, and reducing shock to get a better striking feel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">To achieve the above object, a racket with a center of gravity approximate to a center of a rubber sheet is provided. The racket has a blade comprising a head. The head becomes gradually narrower from front to back, and a line connecting two outermost points of the head is positioned in a front half portion of the head.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5–9</figref>, a racket with a center of gravity approximate to a center of a rubber sheet of the present invention is provided. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5–7</figref> show a first racket <b>3</b> of the present invention that is an improvement upon the conventional square racket, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8–9</figref> show a second racket <b>4</b> of the present invention that is an improvement upon the conventional circular racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6–8</figref>, each of rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> of the present invention comprises a blade <b>31</b>, <b>41</b>, and a rubber sheet <b>34</b>, <b>44</b>. The blades <b>31</b>, <b>41</b> comprise a head <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, a neck <b>302</b>, <b>402</b>, and a handle <b>33</b>, <b>43</b>, respectively. The rubber sheets <b>34</b>, <b>44</b> are attached to the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. The necks <b>302</b>, <b>402</b> are disposed between the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> and the handles <b>33</b>, <b>43</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in order to make centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> of the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> close to centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b>, portions <b>322</b>, <b>422</b> disposed in corners of two sides of a rear end of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are removed, and two extending portions <b>321</b>, <b>421</b> (the diagonal portion) disposed in corners of two sides of a front end of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are extended. Thus, the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are substantially trapezoid-shaped. The front ends of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> define an arched wide side, respectively (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). A line connecting outermost points of the arched wide sides or other shape of wide sides is disposed in a half potion of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. The two arched wide sides gradually narrow from the two outermost points to the necks <b>302</b>, <b>402</b> to define two sides of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. A narrow side is formed in the rear ends of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. Thus, the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are trapezoid-shaped when seen from the wide sides to the narrow sides. The square racket is improved to a trapezoid-shaped racket or the circular racket is improved to a trapezoid-shaped racket, making the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> of the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> close to the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Additionally, if the handles <b>33</b>, <b>43</b> or the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can be lightened, the object of the present invention is further achieved. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a handle <b>33</b> of the first racket <b>3</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8–9</figref> illustrates a handle <b>43</b> of the second racket <b>4</b>. The handle <b>43</b> is formed by removing part of a rear end of the handle <b>33</b> and a concave portion <b>331</b> is defined. A hole <b>431</b> is bored along an axial direction in the rear end of the handle <b>43</b>, and the hole <b>431</b> maybe a single hole or a plurality of holes with different sizes. This can lighten the handles <b>33</b>, <b>43</b> and make the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> even closer to the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In other words, the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> of the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can be closer to the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b> compared to the centers of gravity <b>101</b>, <b>201</b> of the conventional rackets by making the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> gradually narrower from front to back and lightening the handles <b>33</b>, <b>43</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> (or the rubber sheets <b>34</b>, <b>44</b>) are divided into three equal portions (three L/3s). As can be seen from above, the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> of the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are positioned in the high ball-strike area of the middle, but the center of gravity <b>101</b> (<b>201</b>) is positioned beyond the area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The racket with a center of gravity approximate to a center of a rubber sheet of the present invention has the following advantages: First, the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> are closer to the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b>. Because the player will strike balls with the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b>, areas adjacent of the centers of rubber sheet <b>341</b>, <b>441</b> are in the high ball-strike area. In other words, the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> can be positioned in the high ball-strike area. Second, because the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> all move forwardly, the moment is increased. Third, because the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b> are in the high ball-strike area (even when the moment is increased), high energy balls can be hit in areas adjacent the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b>. Balls are thus hit more aggressively, and making various games more fun and popular. Fourth, because the areas of the half front portion of the heads <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are increased, it is difficult to lose balls far from the player, which enhances the defense. Fifth, because the strike are close to the centers of gravity <b>301</b>, <b>401</b>, shock can be reduced. Sixth, because the front ends of the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are wide sides, wind fanned from the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is bigger than that of the conventional square racket and the circular racket, making them more useful for a player to disseminate heat. Seventh, because the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> (blades <b>31</b>, <b>41</b>) are substantially triangular in shape, the rackets <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can in incised with little waste to satisfy environmental protection regulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">As can be seen from the above, the racket with a center of gravity approximate to a center of a rubber sheet of the present invention can indeed solve the problems of the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extend indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</div>
