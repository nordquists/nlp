<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/029,959 filed Feb. 20, 2008.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This invention generally relates to a paddle used for playing table tennis, which is commonly referred to as ping pong. More particularly, the invention relates to a double-sided paddle in which a user's hand glides in between to hold the paddle and to allow for more direct control of a ball during play.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Table tennis is a relatively young sport that originated in the early 1800's by British Army officers that used lids from cigar boxes as paddles, rounded corks from wine bottles as balls and a row of books aligned across the middle of a table to form a “net.” Later, hollow celluloid, or plastic, balls were used in place of rounded cork balls. The name “ping pong” derived from the sound made when the hollow celluloid balls hit the paddle and then hit the table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">With the growing popularity of ball games which a ball or other game projectile is struck by a paddle, various paddle configurations have been developed to provide better control of the ball during play. Conventional paddles commonly use a flat panel, which is fixed to a handle. A player's fingers wrap around the handle to hold the paddle in a bat-like manner. This configuration provides marginal ball control as the player swings the paddle at the ball. Players often wrap their hand around the flat panel to obtain more direct control of the ball. The disadvantage to using conventional paddles in this way is that the transition from forehand to backhand is difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">An improvement to the bat-like paddle was the two-sided bat or racquet shown in U.S. Pat. No. 1,930,281. This invention included two independent striking surfaces supported by a pair of parallel stays. A central handle extended transversely between the stays. The disadvantage to using this invention was that a player's fingers were wrapped around the handle in a fist-like manner to hold the paddle similar to conventional paddles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The paddle of U.S. Pat. No. 2,987,316 completely eliminated the handle of a conventional type of a table tennis or ping pong paddle. This invention included a pair of spaced oppositely facing paddles connected by a pair of spacers extending between the paddles which were used for receiving the finger portion of a hand. The paddle received a player's hand in a flat or extended position. The disadvantage to using this invention was that the paddle relied on a frictional engagement with the palm and back of the hand for mounting the paddles on a player's fingers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">It is desirable to configure a double-sided ping pong paddle that allows a player's hand to glide in between opposing panels for ease of use and fast transition from forehand to backhand, but to provide a stop for the player's thumb and fingers to hold the paddle with the palm of his or her hand in a flat position.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">It is therefore an objective of this invention to provide a double-sided table tennis or ping pong paddle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">It is a further object of this invention to provide such a double-sided table tennis or ping pong paddle that guides a player's hand into proper alignment to be received by the interior of the paddle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">It is yet a further object of this invention to provide such a double-sided table tennis or ping pong paddle which is configured to provide a glove-like fit to a player's hand to allow for fast and easy transition from forehand to backhand and to provide more direct control of the ball during play. The paddle will also eliminate vibrations which commonly occur when hitting a ball off-center.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">This invention features a pair of lateral members spaced proximately equivalent to the height of a player's hand, from the palm to the back of the hand. Both lateral members are similar in configuration, although the invention does not preclude different sized members for the forehand or the backhand members, as the player finds useful. The lateral members have an outer circumference and an arched relief at the end closest to where the player's hand is received to provide clearance for the player's wrist, although the invention does not preclude other shapes as the player finds useful. Each lateral member further comprises a striking surface, which may have a grit exterior or rubber coating similar to table tennis or ping pong paddles of conventional design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">A mounting structure extends transversely between the spaced lateral members on the interior side opposite the striking surface to connect and fix the lateral members with respect to one another. The mounting structure can be oriented parallel to or traverse to, the longitudinal axis of the paddle. The mounting structure is preferably made of molded wood, although the invention does not preclude the mounting structure from being made using different materials such as metal, plastic, carbon fiber, rubber or epoxy resin. In a preferred embodiment, the mounting structure is contoured such that spaced lateral members diverge forming a V-shaped guide. More broadly, the pair of spaced lateral members have longitudinal axes, which diverge forming a V-shaped guide. The invention, as intended, comprises of multiple diverging angles, including parallel members, as the player finds useful, to accommodate the player's hand. Suitable vertical distances between the spaced lateral members on the interior side opposite the striking surfaces to accommodate different sized hands include about 1.1 inches (28 mm) at the fingertip end of the paddle and about 2.2 (56 mm) at the wrist end of the paddle for large thickness hands; about 1 inch (26 mm) at the fingertip end of the paddle and about 2 inches (52 mm) at the wrist end of the paddle for medium thickness hands; and about 0.95 inches (24 mm) at the fingertip end of the paddle and about 1.9 inches (48 mm) at the wrist end for small thickness hands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The height of the mounting structure is configured to provide a glove-like fit to the player's hand to allow for fast and easy transition from forehand to backhand, and to provide more direct control of the ball during play. The mounting structure is preferably offset laterally of the centerline of the spaced lateral members to allow the player's hand to glide in between the lateral members. The mounting structure can also be transverse to the longitudinal axis of the paddle and positioned at the fingertip end of the paddle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Preferably, a thumb grip is integrated with a longitudinally oriented mounting structure to provide a grip for the player's thumb for holding the paddle. One advantage of this mounting structure with the thumb grip is that the paddle is easily adaptable for left-handed or right-handed play. Another advantage to using the invention is that the paddle does not rely on a frictional engagement with the palm and back of the hand for mounting the paddles on the player's fingers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In a preferred embodiment, the spaced lateral members are fastened to the mounting structure using glue/adhesive; although other methods of attachment such as screws, dowels, rivets and epoxies can be used and are considered within the scope of the invention. Conventional wood glues are suitable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">An ergonomically shaped thumb grip is separate from, or more preferably integrated with, a longitudinally oriented mounting structure at the end of the paddle where the player's hand is received. In the preferred embodiment, the thumb grip is preferably molded into the mounting structure, although the invention does not preclude a separable thumb grip made of different materials such as plastic, rubber, leather, fabric or metal. In the preferred embodiment, the thumb grip is sized to accommodate players' thumbs of different sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Another embodiment of the paddle includes a pinky stop proximately located offset laterally of the centerline of the space lateral members opposite s longitudinal oriented mounting structure. The pinky stop provides an additional constraint feature for the player's hand opposite the thumb grip and nearest the pinky finger. The pinky stop can be of multiple configurations including, but not limited to, an elliptical or rectangular shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A further embodiment of the paddle comprises the spaced lateral members and a transversely oriented mounting structure manufactured as a single unit using a method such as an injection molded plastic, a rubber process or molded carbon fiber, wood or metal. In the single unit design, the mounting structure is preferably positioned at the finger tip end of the paddle, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the paddle and a finger hole is proximately located in the mounting structure, which is opposite the end where the player's hand is received into the paddle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In a still further embodiment of the single-piece paddle, a hand grip is proximately located on the interior side of one of the spaced lateral members opposite the striking surface. The hand grip is sized to accommodate players hands of different sizes. The hand grip is preferably a leather band although other fabrics and materials, such as elastic, are considered within the scope of the invention. In the preferred embodiment, the hand grip is fastened to the outer circumference of the spaced lateral member using tacks. Other methods of attachment such as staples, adhesives or epoxy resin are viable means of fastening the hand grip to the space lateral member. An integral hand grip molded directly into the spaced lateral member during the fabrication process is also considered within the scope of the invention. Alternately, a replaceable hand grip attached to the spaced lateral member by means of a slip fit joint or hook and loop fastener means is considered within the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In still a further embodiment of the single-piece paddle, an ergonomically shaped thumb grip connects the lateral members on the interior side opposite the striking surface to connect the lateral members and is proximately located at the end of paddle where the player's hand is received. The thumb grip is preferably a molded dowel made of the same material as the spaced lateral members, although the invention does not preclude different materials such as metal, plastic, carbon fiber, rubber or epoxy resin. In the preferred embodiment, the thumb grip is molded integrally with the spaced lateral members during the fabrication process. Alternatively, a separable thumb grip, which is fastened to the spaced lateral members using screws, dowels, rivets, adhesives and epoxies, can be used and is considered within the scope of this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In another embodiment of the invention, the first lateral member and second lateral member are connected by the mounting structures extending transversely between the spaced lateral members on the interior side opposite the striking surfaces and are located at the fingertip end of the paddle. In this embodiment, the mounting structure is a wooden dowel proximately located at the fingertip end of the paddle, the end of the paddle opposite the end where the player's hand is received. A thumb grip also connects the lateral members on the interior side opposite the striking surfaces and is proximately located at the end of paddle where the player's hand is received. The thumb grip is offset laterally of the centerline of the lateral members to provide a grip for the player's thumb. The thumb grip is preferably a wooden dowel, although the invention does not preclude different materials such as plastic, rubber or metal. In the preferred embodiment, the thumb grip is taller than the mounting structures such that the spaced lateral members diverge forming a V-shaped guide. The height of the thumb grip and the mounting structures are configured to provide glove-like fit to the player's hand.</div>
