<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">1. Field of the Present Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The present invention relates generally to multi-purpose ball implements, and, in particular, a system for picking up, tossing, and striking a ball in such a way that the ball does not come in contact with a user's hands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">2. Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">It can be appreciated that implements for hitting or striking a ball have been in use for years. Typically, ball strikers include, but are not limited to, baseball bats, tennis racquets, cricket bats, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">One problem with most conventional implements for striking a ball is that they have no device which retains a ball, where a user can eject the ball upward in order to strike the ball without touching the ball. Several attempts have been made to solve this problem, at least with regard to baseball bats and the like, as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,115,342, 3,169,019 and 4,930,772, but each bat disclosed therein suffers at least from the problem that the means for holding the ball and enabling it to be flipped or tossed in the air also causes interference with the proper striking of the ball; i.e., the openings or attached ball-cups cover or eliminate part of the hitting surface from proper use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In addition, neither these implements nor any other known ball implements have a device or method or means to pick up a ball without bending down and/or touching the ball with at least one hand. Furthermore, no known implement in the form of other types of ball-striking implements, such as that of a tennis racquet or the like, has been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Thus, while conventional devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not suitable for persons to pick up a ball, toss a ball, and strike a ball, while not touching the ball with at least one hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In these respects, a system for picking up, tossing, and striking a ball in such a way that the ball does not come in contact with a user's hands, according to the present invention, substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing, provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of persons to pick up, toss, and strike a ball, while not touching the ball with at least one hand.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The present invention provides a new hands free ball pick up, toss, and strike system wherein the same can be utilized for persons to pick up, toss, and strike a ball, while not touching the ball with their hands. Broadly defined, the present invention according to at least one aspect includes a device which may be attachable to an implement used to strike a ball, or may be part of an implement used to strike a ball, that is capable of retrieving a ball from the ground, holding the ball, and facilitating tossing the ball into the air to allow the implement it is attached to or implement that it is part of, to subsequently strike the ball. In one embodiment, the device used to pick up the ball is a scoop or shovel shape. In another embodiment, the device used to pick up the ball is a press-fit ball grabber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">A purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new hands free ball pick, toss, and strike system that has many of the advantages of the ball-striking implements mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new hands free ball pick up, toss, and strike system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art ball pick up, toss, and/or strikers, either alone, or in any combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">With the ball <b>110</b> in the air, the user <b>115</b> may then use the implement <b>102</b> to strike the ball <b>110</b>, thus propelling it, in many cases, a substantial distance from the user <b>115</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an environmental view of a user <b>115</b> striking a ball <b>110</b> with the multi-purpose implement <b>102</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Typically, the user waits until the ball <b>110</b> reaches the apex of its ejection path and, under the force of gravity, begins descending toward the ground. While the ball <b>110</b> is descending, the user <b>115</b> hits the ball <b>110</b> with the striking implement <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Upon contact with the striking implement <b>100</b>, the ball <b>110</b> travels in the direction the user <b>115</b> hits the ball <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">This ability, for the user <b>115</b> to lift, toss and strike the ball <b>110</b> without using his or her hands, is particularly beneficial in situations where a user <b>115</b> is playing fetch with a dog <b>116</b>, when the ground or ball <b>110</b> is wet or dirty, or during baseball training or the like when the user is holding the implement <b>102</b> in one hand and his other hand is otherwise occupied. For example, when conducting practice, a baseball coach may find it beneficial to hold or wear a baseball glove on one hand while holding the multi-purpose implement <b>102</b> in the other, thereby enabling him to catch thrown baseballs <b>110</b> with his glove but to lift baseballs from the ground and to toss and strike them with the same implement <b>102</b>, all without removing his glove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Although as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the striking implement <b>100</b> takes the form of a conventional baseball bat and has a generally circular cross-section, it will be appreciated that the striking implement <b>100</b> may take any shape that includes a striking portion sufficient for striking a ball <b>110</b> to cause the ball <b>110</b> to travel in a desired direction.
