<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The invention is a ping-pong game set and, more particularly, a portable ping-pong game set assembly that can be used to play ping-pong on any flat surface and, in particular, on tables or flat surfaces of varying widths. The present invention comprises a retractable net assembly and paddles having retractable handles for portability and compact packaging. The net assembly of the present invention includes a storage chamber for ping-pong balls.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Ping-pong, or table tennis, is a well-known game involving usually two or four players where players use ping-pong paddles to serve and rally a ping-pong ball for points. When there are two players the game is referred to as a singles game. When there are four players the game is referred to as a doubles game. Sometimes a single player can play against a wall or some other flat surface; the game is then referred to as a solo game. In competitive ping-pong, players compete for matches where a winning match is the best of any odd number of games chosen, for example, 3 of 5 games, 4 of 7 games, or 5 of 9 games. For each game, the first player to reach 11 points wins that game, however a game must be won by at least a two point margin. If both sides earn 10 points the game is won by the first side to subsequently earn a lead of 2 points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Play commences after a player or a pair of players chooses, for example, by winning a coin toss, to serve, to receive first, or to start at a particular end. The other player or pair assumes the opposing position: to receive, to serve first, or to start at the end opposite from the particular end chosen by the other player or pair. The game commences when a player puts a ball into play by being the first to strike the ball for a point, or putting the ball in service or serving the ball. A ball is put in service when a player (also referred to as the server): (1) holds the ball freely on the open palm of her stationary and free hand; (2) projects the ball in a nearly vertical direction, without imparting spin, so that it rises at least 16 cm after leaving the server's palm and then falls without touching anything before being struck; (3) as the ball falls, strikes the ball with a paddle so that the ball touches her court and then, after passing over or around the net assembly, touches directly the receiver's court (in doubles, the ball shall touch successively the right half court of server and receiver). At all times during a serve the ball is above the level of the playing surface and behind the server's end line and it shall not be hidden from the receiver by any part of the body or clothing of the server or her double's partner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Points are scored after each ball is put into play (not just when the server wins the point as in volleyball). If the ball makes contact with the net during the serve, otherwise known as a let, the rally is not scored and the ball is served again. So long as the serve is implemented according to the steps outlined above, the ball is in play and the receiver must return the ball. The receiver returns the ball by striking the ball with her paddle so that it passes over or around the net assembly and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly. Then either player may win the point. A player can win a point in the follows ways: (1) if the opponent server fails to make a good service; (2) if the opponent receiver fails to make a good return; (3) if, after he has made a good service or a good return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by his opponent; (4) if the ball passes beyond his end line without touching his court, after being struck by his opponent; (5) if his opponent obstructs the ball; (6) if his opponent strikes the ball twice successively; (7) if his opponent, or anything his opponent wears or carries, moves the playing surface; (8) if his opponent, or anything his opponent wears or carries, touches the net assembly; (9) if his opponent's free hand touches the playing surface; and (10) if a doubles opponent strikes the ball out of the sequence established by the first server and first receiver (in doubles the server shall first make a good service, the receiver shall then make a good return, the partner of the server shall then make a good return, the partner of the receiver shall then make a good return and thereafter each player in turn in that sequence shall make a good return). It should be appreciated that these are some of the standard ways points are earned in a game of ping-pong but there are other ways points may be earned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Competitive ping-pong is governed by the ITTF, the International Table Tennis Federation. The ITTF was founded in 1926, the nine founding members being Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, India, Sweden and Wales. The first international tournament was held in January 1926 in Berlin while the first World Table Tennis Championships was held in December 1926 in London. The role of the ITTF includes overseeing rules and regulations and seeking technological improvement for the sport of table tennis. The ITTF is responsible for the organization of numerous international competitions, including the World Table Tennis Championships that has continued since 1926. Over the years, ping-pong has maintained a steady interest among competitive players and non-competitive players.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Traditional ping-pong sets include a table, a net assembly, paddles and balls, and are expensive, heavy, and bulky. An example of a prior art ping-pong set is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a perspective view of ping-pong game set assembly <b>1</b> comprising table <b>2</b>, net <b>8</b>, net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D, paddles <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, and ball <b>5</b>. Ball <b>5</b> is typically spherical, hollow, lightweight, and made of celluloid or some other lightweight plastic to ensure high-bouncing capability. Ball <b>5</b> is usually white or some other color that contrasts with the color of the table so that users can easily see the ball when playing. Originally, the standard ping-pong ball was 38 mm, or 1.5 inches, in diameter. After the 2000 Olympic Games, however, the 38 mm ball was replaced by a 40 mm ball, which is identical in material, but since the diameter is larger, ball <b>5</b> is slower and spins less than the traditional ping-pong ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Paddles <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each comprise a blade and a handle. Paddles <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B usually have between one and seven plies of wood, although cork, glass fiber, carbon fiber, aluminum fiber, and para-aramid synthetic fiber, such as Kevlar® brand synthetic fiber, are sometimes used. The blades of paddles <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B are usually elliptical in shape, laminated, and covered with an anti-slip material such as rubber. The average size of a blade is about 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) long and 6 inches (15 cm) wide. Although there are no official restrictions on the shape or size of the blade itself, these dimensions are optimal for most play styles. It is customary for the blade and handle to be fixedly secured to one another. In some cases, the blade and handle are carved out of a single mass of material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B and bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D are arranged to secure net <b>8</b> across the top of table <b>2</b>. Net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B are usually made of a rigid material. Bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D are usually made of some rigid material and comprise a device which is attachable to table <b>2</b> and operatively arranged to maintain the upright arrangement of net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B which are arranged to maintain the upright, fully extended, and taut arrangement of net <b>8</b> across the top of table <b>2</b>. Net <b>8</b> is made of a lightweight mesh material and typically about 5 feet long and approximately 6 inches tall. Table <b>2</b> is typically about 5 feet wide to accommodate the length of net <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The ping-pong set assembly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> poses a number of limitations. Firstly, the ping-pong net assembly is suitable for game play only on tables of a particular width. The net assembly is not suitable for use and game play on a table having a width less than or greater than the width of the net. Secondly, this conventional ping-pong set is bulky. Thirdly, the ping-pong net assembly shown is cumbersome to remove because removing it involves unclamping, unscrewing, or otherwise undoing clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D from table <b>2</b>. A fourth limitation posed by the ping-pong net assembly shown is that net <b>8</b>, net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, and bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D are permanently exposed. Thus, they can be damaged easily. A fifth limitation is that net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B and bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D become loosened and require fine-tuning to ensure net <b>8</b> is upright, fully extended, and taut across the top of table <b>2</b>. The fine-tuning required is inconvenient for a player because it takes time away from game play. The fine-tuning required is also inconvenient because it is often difficult for a user to accurately set net tensioning brackets <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B and bracket clamps <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D so that net <b>8</b> is fully extended and taut. Additionally, the fine-tuning can cause wear and tear on table <b>2</b>. A sixth limitation is that paddles <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B have an awkward shape thus, they are not easy to store and/or pack. Yet another limitation is that the ping-pong set assembly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has no convenient place to store ball <b>5</b>. Finally, the net assembly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> must be clamped to a table top, and not all table tops are suitable for clamping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Patentees and applicants for patents have addressed other problems related to the game of ping pong and other racquet sports. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,590 (Lin) discloses an adjustable ping-pong net assembly comprising a net, first and second vertical hollow cylinders each having net supports, two base pieces having clamps, and a spring-biased shaft to tension the net when the supports are mounted on opposite sides of the table. One end of the net is fixedly secured within the first hollow cylinder containing the coiled spring-biased shaft while the other end of the net is fixed to a stopper which is operatively arranged to be inserted into the second hollow cylinder for game play. When the net assembly is not in use, a user can remove the net from the second hollow cylinder and allow the spring-biased shaft within the first hollow cylinder to automatically wind the net. The retractable ping-pong net assembly disclosed is problematic because the stopper can deform due to repeated assembly and disassembly. Additionally, a piece of dirt or debris can clog the second hollow cylinder which is intended to receive the stopper of the net thereby preventing assembly. Furthermore, the automatic spring-biased shaft can malfunction due to its complexity. This reference also fails to disclose a storage chamber for a ping-pong ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">U.S. Patent Application No. 2006/0205541 (D'Estais) discloses an adjustable net assembly including two supports each having a fastening means and an automatic net winder. Although this reference discloses an adjustable table tennis net assembly that improves the compatibility of the traditional ping-pong net assembly with tables of varying widths, the invention suffers from a few disadvantages. Firstly, the invention includes an interlocking alignment of the two supports when the supports are proximate and in contact with one another. A problem with this interlocking alignment is that the bottom-most portions of the two supports are not planar. Instead, the bottom-most portions of the two supports are arranged where one support is beneath the other. Given this arrangement, the net supports cannot be arranged upright on a flat surface. Rather, the net supports can only be arranged along a flat surface longitudinally. This longitudinal arrangement takes up more space than an upright perpendicular arrangement. Secondly, this reference discloses net supports having a fastening means to fix the net assembly to a table. As discussed above, a net assembly having a fastening means is cumbersome. Thirdly, the automatic winder disclosed is complex and therefore expensive to manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">As described previously, most ping-pong paddles are of one-piece, unitary construction. This paddle structure requires a larger package for shipping and retail sales. Others have noticed this issue in other racquet sports. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,574 (Curtis) is directed to a collapsible tennis racquet comprising a racquet head and a detachable handle. This racquet includes a detachable handle, however, and not a non-detachable, retractable handle, resulting in less space savings for packaging, and a chance that the handle or head will be lost or misplaced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Therefore, there is a long-felt need for a portable ping-pong set that can be arranged quickly and easily on any flat surface. There is also a long-felt need for a ping-pong set assembly that stores compactly. There is also a long-felt need for a ping-pong net assembly that has an adjustable net length so the net assembly can accommodate tables of varying widths, and can rest atop a table surface without clamping. Finally, there is a long-felt need for a ping-pong paddle having a non-detachable, retractable handle.</div>

As just described first outer alignment member <b>35</b>A and second outer alignment member <b>35</b>B enclose first handle end <b>33</b>A of first retractable handle <b>32</b>A. First outer prong <b>71</b>A is shown slidingly engaging with narrow channel <b>62</b> between first outer alignment member <b>35</b>A and baffle <b>60</b>A. Since first retractable handle <b>32</b>A is partially extended, first prong end <b>39</b>A is free to slide leftwardly or rightwardly with the rest of first retractable handle <b>32</b>A. Center prong <b>73</b> is shown slidingly engaging with narrow channel <b>64</b> between baffle <b>60</b>B and baffle <b>60</b>C.

Similarly, the width of first prong end <b>39</b>A is substantially similar to the width of narrow channel <b>62</b> and the width of second prong end <b>39</b>B is substantially similar to the width of narrow channel <b>66</b>. First cross-brace <b>85</b>A is shown fixedly secured between first prong end <b>39</b>A and center prong <b>73</b> and on top of baffle <b>60</b>A and baffle <b>60</b>B. Therefore, it should be appreciated that the height of baffle <b>60</b>A and the height of baffle <b>60</b>B are less than the height of first prong end <b>39</b>A and the height of center prong <b>73</b>. First looped member <b>74</b>A is shown between first outer prong <b>71</b>A and center prong <b>73</b> next to first prong space <b>80</b>A. It should be appreciated that first looped member <b>74</b>A is operatively arranged to slidingly engage leftwardly through first prong space <b>80</b>A and narrow channel <b>63</b>. First looped member <b>74</b>A is also operatively arranged to slidingly engage rightwardly through first prong space <b>80</b>A. Second looped member <b>74</b>B is shown between center prong <b>73</b> and second outer prong <b>71</b>B next to second prong space <b>80</b>B. Like first looped member <b>74</b>A, second looped member <b>74</b>B is operatively arranged to slidingly engage leftwardly through second prong space <b>80</b>B and narrow channel <b>65</b>. Second looped member <b>74</b>B is also operatively arranged to slidingly engage rightwardly through second prong space <b>80</b>B. The width of first looped member <b>74</b>A is substantially similar to the width of narrow channel <b>63</b>.

Hence, the height of baffle <b>60</b>C and the height of baffle <b>60</b>D are less than the height of second prong end <b>39</b>B and the height of center prong <b>73</b>. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the length of baffle <b>60</b>B and the length of baffle <b>60</b>C are substantially similar. The length of baffle <b>60</b>A and the length of baffle <b>60</b>C are substantially similar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a detailed view of first locking button <b>36</b>A shown in area <b>19</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, illustrating first locking button <b>36</b>A when first handle <b>32</b>A is fully extended. This cross-sectional view depicts from left to right center prong <b>73</b>, first locking button <b>36</b>A, and first handle body <b>70</b>. These components are shown protruding from between first top paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A and first bottom paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A′. Surrounding first locking button <b>36</b>A, this view shows button aperture <b>82</b>, button compression space <b>83</b>, and button extension space <b>84</b>. When a user pulls handle body <b>70</b> of first retractable handle <b>32</b>A rightwardly to the fullest extent, first locking button <b>36</b>A naturally protrudes upward. This natural upward protrusion is due to a constant upward pressure coming from a springing mechanism within the connectivity of first looped member <b>74</b>A and second looped member <b>74</b>B to center prong <b>73</b>. In order to allow first locking button <b>36</b>A to protrude upward, in between first top paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A and first bottom paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A′, there is button compression space <b>83</b> and button extension space <b>84</b>. Additionally, on the right-hand side of first locking button <b>36</b>A and next to first handle body <b>70</b>, the present invention comprises button aperture space <b>82</b>. As discussed above, when first retractable handle <b>32</b>A is fully extended, button aperture space <b>82</b> is largest. In this position, button extension space <b>84</b> is smallest. In contrast, in this position button compression space <b>83</b> is largest. Button compression space <b>83</b> is largest because button compression space <b>83</b> is necessary to allow first locking button <b>36</b>A to move downward when a user presses first locking button <b>36</b>A. Similarly, button extension space <b>84</b> is necessary to allow first locking button <b>36</b>A to move upward when a user pulls first retractable handle <b>32</b>A into its fully extended position. When first retractable handle <b>32</b>A is in its fully extended position, button extension space <b>84</b> is smallest because first locking button <b>36</b>A is in its most upward position. This figure also shows that first locking button <b>36</b>A is next to first top paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A when first retractable handle <b>32</b>A is fully extended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a detailed view of first locking button <b>36</b>A shown in area <b>20</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, depicting first locking button <b>36</b>A when first handle <b>32</b>A is fully retracted. This cross-sectional also view depicts from left to right center prong <b>73</b>, first locking button <b>36</b>A, and first handle body <b>70</b> between first top paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A, and first bottom paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A′. Also, this view illustrates button aperture <b>82</b>, button compression space <b>83</b>, and button extension space <b>84</b> surrounding first locking button <b>36</b>A. In contrast to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, first locking button <b>36</b>A is under first top paddle playing surface <b>38</b>A rather than next to it. To retract first retractable handle <b>32</b>A, a user depresses first locking button <b>36</b>A within button compression space <b>83</b> and pushes first retractable handle <b>32</b>A leftwardly. Since a user depresses first locking button <b>36</b>A into button compression space <b>83</b>, button compression space <b>83</b> decreases in size as first locking button descends. When first retractable handle <b>32</b>A is fully retracted, button compression space <b>83</b> is smallest. Similarly, when a user depresses first locking button <b>36</b>A, button aperture <b>82</b> also decreases in size. Button extension space <b>84</b> increases in size because first locking button is pushed downward.</div>
