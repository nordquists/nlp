<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates generally to a sports racquet. In particular, the present invention relates to sports racquet configured for impacting a ball and for facilitating the opening of a cap on a bottle.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Sport racquets or paddles, such as platform tennis racquets, paddle tennis racquets, padel tennis racquets, tennis racquets, table tennis paddles, badminton racquets, racquetball racquets and squash racquets, are well known and enjoyed by users in many recreational activities. Platform tennis is an American racquet sport invented in 1928 in New York, and enjoyed by thousands of people of all ages. It is the only racquet sport that is frequently enjoyed outdoors in cold weather. This unique appeal attracts people who desire fresh air, competition, and social engagement. The game is typically played on an elevated aluminum deck on a court that is smaller than a tennis court. The deck or base of the court is usually enclosed allowing for a heating system to be positioned beneath the deck. The court is surrounded by a 12 foot high, taut wire fencing which allows play off the walls, as in racquetball and squash.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Paddle tennis, which also originated in New York, has existed for over a hundred years. Paddle tennis is a game derived from tennis and played on court that is smaller than a conventional tennis court. Paddle tennis courts are constructed in a manner similar to tennis courts, and can also exist on hard beach sand. Unlike platform tennis, paddle tennis does not require fencing positioned about the court. Paddle tennis is played with a depressurized tennis ball and an underhand serve. The smaller court size adds a strong emphasis and advantage to net play and creates a fast and reaction-based game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Padel tennis (or just pádel) is a racquet sport similar to paddle tennis. It was invented in Acapulco, Mexico in 1969 and played extensively in Spain and Latin America. The court is about half the size of a tennis court and includes walls, which like platform tennis are in play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Sports racquets for platform tennis, paddle tennis and padel tennis are constructed with a rigid rounded planar head portion connected to a handle portion. The head portion is unstrung and typically includes aerodynamic holes extending therethrough. Other sports racquets, such as tennis racquets, badminton racquets, racquetball racquets and squash racquets generally include a head portion that forms closed curved structure supporting a matrix of string segments (also referred to as a string bed). A handle portion is typically coupled to the head portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Many racquet sports are engaged in as part of a social gathering. Such social gatherings provide participants the opportunity to play the racquet sport and to enjoy the company of the other participants. During such social sports activities, it is common for the participants to take breaks, or to rotate in and out of play, to partake in and to enjoy beverages and other refreshments with other participants. During the colder months, platform tennis players will frequent warming huts or break areas to allow players to warm themselves and also to enjoy beverages and other refreshments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">During such events, it is common for players to enjoy bottled beverages. Many bottled beverages are secured with metal bottle caps that are pleated or ruffled around the upper rim of the bottle. Such bottles typically require a bottle opener or other tool to remove the cap from the bottle. Bottle opening tools are small devices that are easily misplaced, lost or forgotten. Accordingly, on many occasions, players engaging in social racquet sporting events can find themselves without a tool for removing caps from the bottles of beverages. Accordingly, a need exists for a convenient way to ensure that players at social racquet sporting events do not find themselves without a device or tool for removing the caps from beverage bottles. It would be advantageous to provide a mechanism for ensuring that a social sporting event can be held with refreshments without having to remember to bring, carry or obtain a tool for removing a cap from a beverage bottle.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The present invention provides a sports racquet for impacting a game ball and for facilitating the opening of a cap on a bottle. The sports racquet includes a head portion and a handle portion. The handle portion has a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end is coupled to the head portion. The proximal end defines a recess, and includes a projection spaced apart from a fulcrum. The recess is sized to removably receive a portion of the cap. The projection is configured to catch a portion of an underside of the cap and the fulcrum is configured to bear against the top of the cap as one or both of the handle portion and the bottle serve as a lever for prying the cap off of the bottle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">According to a principal aspect of a preferred form of the invention, a butt cap is configured for attachment to a handle portion of a sports racquet and for facilitating the removal of a cap from a bottle. The butt cap includes a body having a distal region and a proximal region. The distal and proximal regions define first and second opposing recesses, respectively. The first recess is sized to receive a proximal end of the handle portion of the sports racquet. The second recess is sized to removably receive at least a portion of the cap. The proximal region includes a projection and a fulcrum. The projection is configured to engage a portion of an underside of the cap and is spaced apart from the fulcrum. The fulcrum is configured to operably engage the top of the cap as one or both of the handle portion and the bottle serve as a lever for prying the cap off of the bottle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">According to another preferred aspect of the invention, a sports racquet for impacting a game ball and for facilitating the opening of a cap on a bottle includes a rigid head portion, a handle portion and a butt cap. The head portion includes opposing first and second planar surfaces. The head portion defines a plurality of holes perpendicularly extending from the first surface through to the second surface.
