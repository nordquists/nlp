<div class="description-paragraph">THOMAS D. SINGLETON AND WILLIAM GLEASON, OF PROVIDENCE, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> RHODE ISLAND. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">GAME APPARATUS. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specification of Letters Patent. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Patented Oct. 9, 1906. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To all whom it 1% any concern: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that we, THoMAs D. SINGLE- TON and WILLIAM GLEAsoN, citizens of the United States, residing at Providence, in the county of Providence and State of Rhode Island, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Game Apparatus, of which the following is a specification, reference being had therein to the accompanying drawin s. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> lhis invention relates to improvements in the construction of the bat or battledore used in striking a dart or shuttlecock while playing a game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention consists, essentially, of the application of a piece of metal or other suitable material that will rin to serve the purpose of a bell or gong. Thls bell is preferably located in the center of the battledore. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The object of the game is to bat the shuttlecock into the air or from one person to another and each time it descends to strike it with the center or metal portion of the battledore and cause the same to ring, and each time the plate or bell is rung a point is scored for the player. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The game may be played by a single player or by two or more, if desired. By requiring the player to strike the center of the bat against the dart, and thus ring the bell to score makes the game exceedingly interesting, requiring considerable skill, and teaches the player to strike an accurate blow. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another feature of the invention is that the same is so simple in construction that it may be manufactured at a minimum cost and sold at an exceedingly reasonable price. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention is fully set forth in this specification and more particularly pointed out in the appended claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a View in elevation of our improved bat, showing the bell in the center of the head or enlarged portion. Fig. 2 is an enlarged section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1, illustrating our preferred construction of the bell-plate, showing the support therefor secured to the back or under side of the head. Fig. 3 is a greatly-enlarged section on line 2 2 of Fig. 1, illustrating another construction by which the contactplate will recede when the dart strikes the same, and thereby ring abell which is secured to the under side of the head. Fig. 4 illustrates the dart or shuttlecock, that may be constructed in any desired manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to the drawings, at 10 is the body portion or head of the bat or battledore, preferably constructed from thin flat material, such as a board or the like, substantially circular in shape and having a handle 11 extending therefrom of suitable length and size. The essential feature of the device is that the body is provided with a circular opening at 12 through its center portion, and in this opening is set a plate 13, which is so formed and of such material that it will send forth a ringing sound like that of a bell whenever said plate comes in contact with the dart or shuttlecock on being struck by the bat in the course of the game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The preferred construction of the device is that best illustrated in Fi 2, in which a circular metal plate 13 a little smaller than the aperture is placed in the opening flush with the face of the body of the bat. Fastened to the back side of the body portion by screws 14 14 is the narrow strip 15, from which the said metal plate 13 is supported by the post 16, which post is riveted at 17 into said strip. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A modified form of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 3, in which construction the plate 13 may be driven in or caused to recede, and so strike and ring an auxiliary bell by the impact of the shuttlecock when coming in contact therewith. In this construction the plate 13 is mounted on the spindle 18, which spindle is held to reciprocate through the bearing 19. The plate is held up in position by the action of the coil-spring 20. FiXed to the end of the said spindle 18 is the hammer 21, arranged to come in contact with and ring the bell 22, mounted on the under side of the battledore, when the plate 13 is brought in contact with and driven inward by the shuttlecock while playing the game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This game when played with our improved bat is rendered very interesting, as the player is required to strike the dart with the center portion of the bat in order to score by ringing the bell. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. A bat flattened at one end and having a handle at its opposite end, said flattened portion being provided with a recessediportion, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a pin extending upward from said recessed portion, a metal plate set into said recess and supported on said pin whereby said plate is adapted to ring when brought forcibly in con tact with another object. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. As an article of manufacture, a bat having a handle and an enlarged flattened body portion, said body being formed in a substantially circular shape and provided with an opening through it, a pin suitably supported in said opening and extending toward the upperface of said body, a metal plate set into said opening and supported on said pin whereby a ringing sound will be produced when said plate is brought forcibly in contact with another object. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">3. As an article of manufacture, a bat flattened at one end and having a handle at its opposite end, said flattened portion being provided with an opening through it, a pin suitably supported in said opening and ex tending toward the upper face of said body, a metal plate set into said opening and supported on said pin whereby a ringing sound will be produced when said plate is brought forcibly incontact with another object. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 4. As an article of manufacture, a bat having a handle and an enlarged flattened body portion, said body being formed in a substantially circular shape and provided with an opening through it, a thin metal plate set into said opening on the face of the bat, a supporting-strip secured to the back side of said body, and means for supporting said plate from said strip. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In testimony whereof We affix our signatures in presence of two witnesses. </div>
