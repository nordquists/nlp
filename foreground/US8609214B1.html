<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This application contains technical disclosure in common with U.S. application Ser. No. 10/524,367, titled “Adhesive Backed Skins and Grips for Handheld Devices,” filed 11 Feb. 2005.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The present invention relates to thin film silicone elastomers and methods of manufacturing thin film silicone elastomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Most handheld electronic devices, such as cellular telephones, camcorders, cameras, computer-based digital cameras, CD and MP3 players, PDA's, remote controls, notebook computers, tablet PC's, video games, video game controllers, hair trimmers and shears, and a wide variety of other handheld electronic devices, including carrying cases and pouches for these devices, have housings that are made of hard, smooth materials, such as plastic and metal. Although some of these devices include hand grips and/or small rubberized components, they typically do not include any anti-slip material over a large portion of their housings. This is a problem, because when a user handles one of these devices, the slightest amount of mishandling can allow the device to slip out of the user's hand, which can lead to the device being dropped and damaged. In addition, when these devices are placed on a table or other surface, such as the dashboard of a vehicle, they are vulnerable to sliding or being knocked off onto the floor or ground, which can lead to breakage or permanent damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Most handheld electronic devices have housings that are made of hard, smooth plastic or metal. The front faces of these housings usually include ornamental shapes and designs, but the rear faces are typically plain and smooth. Often, the rear, side, and bottom surfaces include switches, buttons, and access ports for receiving interchangeable components, batteries, and carrying cases. These switches, buttons, and access ports leave exposed joints, seams, and grooves. Flip-type and swivel telephones also include integral plastic and metal hinges and swivels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In addition, many of these handheld electronic devices are configured to fit on top of other components or into accessory components, such as caddies, cradles, chargers, docking stations, computer monitors, carrying cases, and clips. When coupled together, there is usually very little clearance between the device and the accessory component. As a result, it is not possible to place a thick, anti-slip material directly onto the device, as doing so would prevent or impede the device from properly mating with its accessory component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In addition to adding anti-slip functionality to handheld electronic devices, there are many other applications in which anti-slip functionality is desired. For example, in the printing industry, it is desirable to have rollers and other paper handling components that have high gripping capacity and that are highly durable. There are countless other material handling examples across many other industries in which it is desirable to have durable, anti-slip functionality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Also, many applications exist in the sport and recreation industries. For example, many sports require the use of handheld equipment, such as bats, rackets, paddles, sticks, and other devices with gripping surfaces. In these sports, it is usually desirable to have anti-slip functionality associated with this equipment. In addition to handheld equipment, there are many sporting and recreation applications in which it is desirable that there be anti-slip functionality between a users clothing and his equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Although there have been significant developments over the years in the area of producing thin elastomers, considerable shortcomings remain.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">There is a need for a thin film having a silicone elastomer coating for use as an anti-slip skin, grip, or applique that can be applied to various items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a thin film having a silicone elastomer coating or layer applied to one surface of the film and a method for producing the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">This object is achieved by providing a thin, dimensionally stable, smooth plastic film, disposing a silicone elastomer onto the plastic film, and imparting a polished surface finish to the silicone elastomer. In the preferred embodiment, the polished surface finish is imparted to the silicone elastomer by a casting means, such as a casting film, the plastic film-silicone elastomer assembly is cured, and the casting means is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The present invention provides significant advantages, including: (1) stability of the elastomer as related to processing and use is provided; (2) a stabilized bonding surface for applying to other materials is provided; and (3) the ability to efficiently handle a very thin elastomeric coating having a very low durometer is provided.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of exemplary ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention. It should be noted that the layers in the figures are not drawn to scale.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The present invention is directed to a thin, soft, silicone elastomer film for use as an anti-slip skin, or applique. The skin can be applied, adhered, sewn, or otherwise attached to objects, a person's skin, the clothing of a user, or placed between objects, all of which act to prevent or reduce undesired relative motion between adjacent objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">According to the present invention, a silicone elastomer is bonded to a thin, dimensionally stable plastic film substrate to form a flexible, thin film, referred to herein as a “silicone-elastomer film.” It has been found that the use of a silicone material having a low-durometer, i.e., less than 40 on the Shore A scale, and a dimensionally stable, smooth, plastic film having a surface energy of about 40 Dynes/cm, provides the best results. It will be appreciated that many thin plastic films are not dimensionally stable. This configuration overcomes many of the problems associated with thin elastomeric sheets. For example, with the silicone-elastomer film of the present invention, the silicone elastomer is stabilized and prevented from “stretching” and sliding off the surface to which it is applied. In addition, an inexpensive acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive may be used to bond the silicone-elastomer film to other surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The silicone-elastomer film is durable, resilient, and capable of adhering to a suitable acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the silicone elastomer is applied to the plastic film. Then, a textured and polished surface finish is imparted to the silicone elastomer by a casting means having a polished surface finish. This process creates a textured and polished surface finish on the silicone elastomer. The phrase “surface finish” will be used herein to describe the surface of materials on a very fine, or microscopic, scale; whereas the phrase “surface texture” will be used to describe the surface of materials on a larger scale, i.e., to indicate the presence of raised bumps, dimples, or ridges that can be seen with the naked eye and felt by hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The production of a silicone elastomer with a polished and textured surface finish represents a significant discovery in the present invention. It has been found that the use of such a silicone elastomer greatly improves the performance characteristics of the silicone-elastomer film. An equally important discovery in the present invention is the production and use of the thin, dimensionally stable, smooth plastic film substrate. These discoveries provide significant benefits, including: (1) the casting means releases cleanly from the silicone elastomer after curing; (2) the silicone elastomer is significantly more “grippy,” i.e., has a higher coefficient of friction with more anti-slip functionality; and (3) the silicone elastomer is resistant to collecting dust and debris.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> in the drawings, the preferred embodiment of a silicone-elastomer film <b>11</b> according to the present invention is illustrated. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, film <b>11</b> is formed as a sheet, and may be formed as a continuous sheet on a roll (not shown). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of film <b>11</b> showing a two-layer construction of film <b>11</b>, in which a layer of silicone elastomer <b>13</b> having an exposed surface <b>19</b> with a polished surface finish is disposed on an upper surface <b>17</b> of a thin plastic film substrate <b>15</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged view showing the pattern of the surface texture shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, with upraised bubble-shaped dimples <b>21</b> being separated by narrow valleys <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">As explained above, the textured and polished surface finish of silicone-elastomer film <b>11</b> is preferably formed by a casting means, such as a casting film, having a polished surface finish. It will be appreciated that the surface finish of surface <b>19</b> of silicone elastomer <b>13</b> may also be formed by other means, such as tools, dies, or rollers; provided that such means imparts, imprints, or transfers, the desired textured and polished surface finish to silicone elastomer <b>13</b>. Surface <b>19</b> is preferably formed to have a surface texture or pattern, as shown, although surface <b>19</b> may alternatively be matte or smooth. It has been found that, in some instances, the surface texture of surface <b>19</b> does not contribute significantly to the anti-slip functionality of film <b>11</b>; however, certain surface textures do hide imperfections in film <b>11</b> and prevent dust and debris, which are easily seen on matte and smooth surfaces, from collecting on surface <b>19</b>. This improves the look and feel of silicone-elastomer film <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Plastic film substrate <b>15</b> is a thin, flexible film, preferably a clear film about 0.002 inches thick, that forms and provides a flexible, durable, dimensionally stable substrate. It is preferred that plastic film <b>15</b> have a smooth surface finish, as may be attained with a co-extrusion process, and have a surface energy lower than about 40 Dynes/cm. This combination ensures a strong bond between plastic film <b>15</b> and silicone elastomer <b>13</b>. This unique bond prevents silicone elastomer <b>13</b> from easily being detached from plastic film <b>15</b> during manufacture and use of film <b>11</b>. For aesthetic purposes, plastic film <b>15</b> and/or silicone elastomer <b>13</b> may be tinted or may include embedded or printed graphical indicia. It is preferred that the combined thickness of silicone-elastomer film <b>11</b> be no greater than about 0.032 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Silicone elastomer <b>13</b> is formed to have a low-durometer, i.e., less than 40 on the Shore A scale. This, along with the inherent bonding characteristics of silicone materials, facilitates bonding with plastic film <b>15</b>. Silicone <b>13</b> may be applied to plastic film <b>15</b> by pouring, spraying, spreading, doping, or any other conventional application means suitable for applying a silicone material to solid sheets or films. However, as described below, the preferred method of applying silicone elastomer <b>13</b> to plastic film <b>15</b> is by controlled pouring in a continuous production process in which silicone elastomer <b>13</b> is sandwiched between plastic film <b>15</b> and a casting means having a textured and polished surface finish.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in the drawings, an alternative embodiment of the film of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, a film <b>25</b> has an upper portion <b>26</b> that has the same construction as film <b>11</b> described above, in that a silicone elastomer <b>27</b> is applied onto an upper surface <b>29</b> of plastic film <b>31</b>. As such, silicone elastomer <b>27</b> has an exposed surface <b>33</b> with a textured and polished surface finish. To provide a means of affixing film <b>25</b> to an object, a layer of adhesive <b>35</b> is applied to a lower surface <b>37</b> of plastic film <b>31</b>, and a release liner <b>39</b> is placed against surface <b>41</b> of adhesive <b>35</b> for preventing contamination or setting of adhesive <b>35</b> prior to installation of film <b>25</b>. Plastic film <b>31</b> provides a suitable base for which to bond adhesive layer <b>35</b>, as it has been found that it is difficult to obtain a durable bond directly between adhesives and cured silicone materials. Adhesive <b>35</b> may be applied as a tape by other appropriate means, such as in liquid form. Prior to use, release liner <b>39</b> is removed from adhesive <b>35</b>, allowing film <b>25</b> to be adhered to a surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in the drawings, a second alternative embodiment of the film of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, a film <b>43</b> has an upper portion <b>44</b> that has the same construction as film <b>11</b> described above, in that a silicone elastomer <b>45</b> is applied onto an upper surface <b>47</b> of a plastic film <b>49</b>. As such, silicone elastomer <b>45</b> has an exposed surface <b>50</b> with a textured and polished surface finish. A label stock <b>51</b>, which may include graphical and/or textual indicia or other desired items, is adhered to a lower surface <b>53</b> of plastic film <b>49</b> by applying an adhesive layer <b>55</b> to an upper surface <b>54</b> of label stock <b>51</b>. This allows any graphical indicia on label stock <b>51</b> to be visible through silicone elastomer <b>45</b> and plastic film <b>49</b>. To allow for application of film <b>43</b> to a surface, a second adhesive layer <b>57</b> is applied to a lower surface <b>58</b> of label stock <b>51</b>, and a release liner <b>59</b> is applied onto a lower surface <b>61</b> of adhesive layer <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in the drawings, the preferred method of manufacturing a silicone-elastomer film <b>91</b> according to the present invention is schematically illustrated. The first step in the process is to form or provide a casting means, such as a casting film <b>71</b>, that is adapted to transfer a textured and polished surface finish to the silicone elastomer. Casting film <b>71</b> may be formed by a wide variety of conventional means for forming such films. The production of casting film <b>71</b> may be an integral part of the process of manufacturing silicone-elastomer film <b>11</b>, or casting film <b>71</b> may be produced in a separate process prior to use in an off-site facility and stored in sheets or rolls <b>65</b>. This allows casting film <b>71</b> to endure the heat of the curing process described below without undergoing any undesirable changes in shape, dimensions, or composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Casting film <b>71</b> is conveyed toward one or more nipping, or pinch, rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. At the same time, a plastic film substrate <b>73</b>, which is preferably stored in a roll <b>75</b>, is also conveyed toward nipping rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. Due to the thinness of plastic film <b>73</b>, it is preferred that plastic film <b>73</b> be heat stabilized prior to use. This heat stabilization ensures that plastic film <b>73</b> can endure the heat cycle of the curing process without cockling or buckling. This prior heat stabilization of plastic film <b>73</b> is not typical of plastic films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Before casting film <b>71</b> and plastic film <b>73</b> are drawn through nipping rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, a volume of silicone elastomer <b>79</b> is disposed on the upper surface of plastic film <b>73</b>, preferably in liquid form by a nozzle <b>77</b>, or a similar device. Then, plastic substrate <b>73</b>, casting film <b>71</b>, and silicone elastomer <b>79</b> are drawn between nipping rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. This causes silicone elastomer <b>79</b> to spread evenly at a selected thickness over plastic film <b>73</b> and transfers the textured and polished surface finish of casting film <b>71</b> to the exposed surface of silicone elastomer <b>79</b>. This nipping process forms a film assembly <b>85</b> that is then subjected to a curing process, which is indicated by area <b>87</b> in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Curing process <b>87</b> may include raised temperatures and pressures for varying durations of time. The specific temperatures, pressures, and cure times may vary depending upon the specific characteristics that are desired in the final film. It will be appreciated that other layers of materials, such as adhesives, label stocks, and release liners, may also be combined with film assembly <b>85</b>, and that these other layers may be added before or after curing process <b>87</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Next, casting film <b>71</b> is removed from film assembly <b>85</b> and captured on roller <b>89</b>, leaving a completed silicone-elastomer film <b>91</b> having a textured and polished surface finish according to the present invention. Once manufactured in sheet form, silicone-elastomer film <b>91</b> may be configured for a wide variety of uses and applications, by cutting, shaping, and other post-processing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In an alternative method of manufacture, casting film <b>71</b> is reused after it is removed from film assembly <b>85</b>. This embodiment is represented by the phantom lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, a film return loop <b>99</b> is provided so that casting film <b>71</b> may be returned to a location in the process prior to passage through nipping rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The production method shown in the figures and described above is only one example of a configuration for manufacturing the silicone-elastomer films <b>91</b> according to the present invention. The feed paths of casting film <b>71</b> and plastic film <b>73</b> may be configured in a variety of ways to achieve the same results. For example, the positions of the feed paths of casting film <b>71</b> and plastic film <b>73</b> may be reversed, with silicone elastomer <b>79</b> being applied to casting film <b>71</b>, rather than plastic film <b>73</b>, prior to nipping rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>. Another possible configuration has the feed paths of casting film <b>71</b> and plastic film <b>73</b> in generally vertical orientations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref> in the drawings, some possible uses of the silicone-elastomer film of the present invention will now be described with respect to the configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Because silicone-elastomer film <b>25</b> is typically formed as a sheet, a user may cut or otherwise shape portions of the sheet to create desired shapes and sizes of film <b>25</b>. The user then removes release liner <b>39</b> from adhesive <b>35</b>, and applies each film <b>25</b> to a selected surface. Film <b>25</b> then acts as an anti-slip applique for preventing or reducing movement of the selected surface relative to an adjacent surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a handheld electronic device <b>101</b>, in this instance a mobile telephone, onto which silicone-elastomer films <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> are adhesively affixed for use as anti-slip skins, is shown. Skin <b>103</b> is applied to an outer surface <b>107</b> of device <b>101</b>, and skin <b>105</b> is applied to outer surfaces <b>109</b>, <b>111</b>. The outer surface of each skin <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> is preferably formed to have a bubble pattern texture and polished surface finish, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described above. Skins <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> provide anti-slip functionality when device <b>101</b> is placed against other objects or surfaces because the exposed silicone material of skins <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> grips the adjacent surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a silicone-elastomer film <b>113</b> according to the present invention is shown applied to the striking surface <b>115</b> of a ping-pong paddle <b>117</b>. Silicone-Specification elastomer film <b>113</b> ensures a good lateral grip between paddle <b>117</b> and a ball (not shown) struck by the paddle, thereby enhancing the ability of the user to impart spin on the ball when striking the ball. It will be appreciated that the silicone-elastomer films of the present invention may be used on a wide variety of sporting equipment and in a wide variety of recreational applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a silicone-elastomer film <b>119</b> is shown in another use. Film <b>119</b> has been configured into small shapes for application to a user's fingertips <b>121</b>. This provides for high levels of grip between fingertips <b>121</b> and objects being manipulated by the user. For example, films <b>119</b> may be used to allow the user to more easily pull sheets of paper from a stack, or to count money. An advantage of using films <b>119</b> in this application is that fingertips <b>121</b> are not fully enclosed, as with thimble-type fingertip appliances. This allows the user's fingers to “breathe,” and prevents the user from feeling discomfort from heat buildup around fingertips <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The potential applications of the present invention go far beyond the uses mentioned above. The silicone-elastomer film according to the present invention may be used in many different applications across a wide variety of industries, particularly when configured, cut, shaped, and formed for specific applications. For example, the present invention may also be used as follows: (1) as an outer surface of a sleeve for a printer roller or other paper handling equipment; (2) as a self adhesive “hand pad” for weight lifters; (3) as a grip for flashlights; (4) as pads for eyeglass nosepieces; (5) as strips to be applied to the bottom of tool trays to keep tools from sliding; (6) as “barefoot” footwear; and (7) as an anti-slip skin for medical devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In other applications, the film according to the present invention can be used as an applique for, or sewn into, uniforms, clothing, or gear. For example, in motocross, when riders grip their handlebars for long periods of time, their hands and arms become fatigued. The film of the present invention may be placed on the riders pants to allow the rider to periodically grip the motorcycle with his legs. This helps relieve the fatigue in the rider's hands and arms. It will be appreciated that the present invention has additional applications in the motocross industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In an alternate embodiment, the silicone elastomer is disposed on both sides of the plastic film. This can be done, for example, by either coating both sides of the plastic film, or by adhering two silicone-elastomer films together back to back. This configuration allows for anti-slip functionality on both sides of the silicone-elastomer film, and allows the use of the present invention in applications in which it is undesirable to adhere the silicone-elastomer film directly to an object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In another alternate embodiment, substrate <b>15</b> and release liners <b>39</b> and <b>59</b> of films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b>, respectively are configured or treated to allow films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> to be more easily manufactured and stored in rolls. In this embodiment, substrate <b>15</b> and release liners <b>39</b> and <b>59</b> are configured or coated, treated, or otherwise prepared to quickly and easily release from the exposed elastomeric surfaces when films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> are rolled up. The configuration or treatment of substrate <b>15</b> and release liners <b>39</b> and <b>59</b> ensures that the adjacent layers of films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> that are formed by capturing films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> into rolls do not stick together. There are significant advantages to treating both sides of substrate <b>15</b> and release liners <b>39</b> and <b>59</b>, or by making substrate <b>15</b> and release liners <b>39</b> and <b>59</b> out of selected releasable materials, including: (1) the shelf life of films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> can be greatly extended; (2) additional dimensional stability is added; (3) waste is greatly reduced; (4) films <b>11</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>43</b> can be captured on rolls faster and easier; (5) wrinkling and cockling is prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The present invention may be used in wide variety of applications. The films of the present invention may be used to protect the windshields, windows, mirrors, and other breakable or scratchable parts on vehicles in storage or transport, including automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and aircraft, to name few. In such applications, the silicone elastomer surface clings to the surface to which it is applied and the substrate material protects the surface from scratching and other damage. The silicone elastomer material can be quickly and easily removed, and does not leave any residue on the surface when removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In another application, a sheet of silicone elastomer film is placed over a keyboard-type touchpad to provide anti-slip functionality and tactile feedback to the Specification user. This embodiment can be used to replace the LEXAN sheets that are currently placed over flat touchpads. For example, the silicone elastomer material is applied to a label stock and the label stock is then applied to a membrane-type switch to provide tactile feed back. It will be appreciated that the silicone elastomer material can have a selected surface finish that allows the user to tactilely identify certain keys and locations on the touchpad. In addition, the film may include raised portions over the switches to allow a snap-type feedback. In another version of this embodiment, small individual pieces of the silicone elastomer film are placed on the tops of individual keys of keyboards to provide anti-slip functionality to the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In yet another application, the film of the present invention may be used as a fastening device. In this embodiment, a silicone elastomer fastening film is adhered to a first device, and an adhesive backed plastic film is adhered to a second device. When the silicone fastening film is brought into contact with the plastic film, the soft silicone elastomer material wets out on the plastic film causing the second device to remain quasi-fastened to the first device. This embodiment of the present invention is particularly well suited for applications in which sun and heat are factors, such as securing devices to a car dashboard, for example, storing a tire pressure gauge on the dashboard of an automobile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In another application, the silicone elastomer film of the present invention may be used as a mouse pad. In this application, a small sheet of film is placed face-down on a surface. The exposed silicone elastomer material prevents the sheet from moving relative to the surface, but allows quick and easy removal without leaving an adhesive residue. Because the plastic substrate is very smooth with a very low coefficient of friction, a highly lubricious mousing surface is formed. A user can then move a mouse or other pointing device over the plastic surface with little or no drag or resistance. However, the texture of the silicone elastomer does transfer through the plastic film providing a desirable smooth texture. This embodiment is ideal for precision pointing devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">It is apparent that an invention with significant advantages has been described and illustrated. Although the present invention is shown in a limited number of forms, it is not limited to just those forms, but is amenable to various changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof.</div>
