<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Table Tennis Table Return System.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In some embodiments, the system (<b>100</b>) comprises a Table Tennis table return system. The Table Tennis table return system has a Table Tennis table with a first edge, a second edge, two side edges, a net located between the first edge and the second edge, an L-shaped bracket comprising a first arm and second arm, a returning board, a side support bracket, and an attach means to attach the first arm to Table Tennis table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In some embodiments, the first arm of the L-shaped bracket has a first distal end and a proximal end. The second arm has a first distal end and a second proximal end. In some embodiments, the proximal end of first arm connects with the distal end of the second arm to form the L-shaped bracket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The returning board is located on the second arm of the L-shaped bracket and connected with the side support bracket. In some embodiments, the side support bracket is an F-shaped bracket with two flanges having the distance between the two flanges equal to the thickness of the returning board. The top edge of the returning board features chrome trim including a product logo or other manufacturer information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Typically the returning board is located vertically (90° degrees) to the Table Tennis table surface plane. In some embodiments, the returning board is located at a variable angle with respect to the Table Tennis table surface plane. In some embodiments, the side support bracket is pivotably connected with the base support bracket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The side support bracket has a rivet hole at the bottom end. In some embodiments, the hole is aligned with a connection hole located near the proximal end of the first arm forming a pivotable joint. In some embodiments, the side support bracket may also have an arc shaped flange with a proximal end connected near the bottom end of the bracket. In some embodiments, the flange has scales along the flange and an arc shaped slot located at the center of the flange. The first arm has a threaded bolt attached near the proximal end with the distance between the bolt and connection hole equal the distance between the slot and rivet hole. When the returning board is adjusted to desired position, the connection between the side bracket and first arm is locked by tightening a butterfly nut to the threaded bolt. In some embodiments, the butterfly nut can be replaced by a regular nut.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The Pivot angle can be adjusted in a wide range between 0 and 90 degrees, preferably between 80 and 90 degrees. In some embodiments, the pivot angle can be extended beyond 90 degrees to facilitate certain preferences of some users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Typically the returning board is located along the first edge of the Table Tennis table. In some embodiments, the returning board can be located at a variable distance to the first edge of Table Tennis table. In some embodiments, the first arm is slidably attached along one side edge of the Table Tennis table. The first arm has an L-shape and scales on the top surface to allow the arm slide further away from the first edge of Table Tennis table precisely to a desired position. The first arm is removably attached to one side edge of Table Tennis table and tightened by one or more attach means. The attach means can be a C-clamp, F-clamp, bar clamp, spring clamp or any combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The Table Tennis table return system can be configured with an L-shaped bracket attached on one side edge of Table Tennis table. In some embodiments, the returning board covers part of the first edge of the Table Tennis table. Preferably, the returning board covers half the width of the first edge of the Table Tennis table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The Table Tennis table return system can be also configured with two L-shaped brackets attached on both side edges of Table Tennis table. In some embodiments, the two L-shaped bracket are mirror-images of each other. The numbers of the L-shaped bracket on one side are applicable to both L-shaped bracket. The two side support brackets are also mirror-images of each other. The numbers of the side bracket on one side are applicable to both side brackets. The second arm of both L-shaped brackets may be connected together with or without overlap. The two L-shaped bracket may also formed together into one U-shaped bracket with only one arm in the middle to connect both side arms as a base support bracket. The second arm of the L-shaped bracket also functions as the base support bracket for the returning board. In some embodiments, the second arm is an L-shape bracket with two flanges. The flanges can be cane-shaped with the flat side jointed vertically together and vertical distance between the curved side edges is the same as the thickness of the returning board. In some embodiment, there is a base board support located inside the flange.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The returning board can be one piece or comprised of two separate pieces. The two pieces can be the same or different sizes. Preferably each piece is 30 inches wide and 24 inches tall such that the total board is 60 inches wide, which is the same width as a standard Table Tennis table. The board can be other sizes such that the board can also in used for kid-sized Table Tennis tables. The board can be made from hardwood, laminated wood, metal such as aluminum, or a metal alloy. In some embodiments, the board surface facing the Table Tennis table is covered with a rubber coating similar to the material affixed to the striking surfaces of a Table Tennis racket. The rubber coating may be of pimpled rubber, with the pimples outward, or it may be a rubber that is composed of two materials, a sponge layer, covered by a pimpled rubber, with the pimples pointed inwards or outwards. The total thickness of the returning board including the rubber coating is preferably ½ inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In some embodiments, the returning board has a strip on the top edge of the board. In some embodiments, the strip contains the product logo or other manufacturer's information, such as manufacturer's website, customer service hotline number, etc. The strip can be chromed or painted in a color different from the main body color of the returning board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">When the returning board comprises two pieces, each piece can be adjustable independently regarding pivot angles thus allowing different degrees between the pieces. Moreover, each piece can be located to different distance to the first edge of the Table Tennis table. Thus the player can set the system in a more personalized way according to his/her preferences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In some embodiments, the arc shaped flange is pivotably connected to the side support bracket through a plurality of hinges. The hinges enable the returning board to be located at various swing angles. Hence, the uses can adjust the distance, pivot angle, swing angle or a combination thereof according to his/her preference and skills.</div>
