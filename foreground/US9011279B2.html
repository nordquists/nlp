<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/772,005, filed on Feb. 20, 2013, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/601,075, filed on Feb. 21, 2012, all of which are incorporated by reference as if completely written herein.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present disclosure relates to the field of sports equipment, and more particularly, to a sports equipment handle that provides a user with tactile biofeedback.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The sports equipment handle is perhaps the most overlooked and underappreciated piece of sports equipment. Sports equipment handle technology has changed very little over the past few decades.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">For the most part, the sports equipment handle has not been considered as a means for game improvement. Rather, the sports industry has primarily focused on the impact head of a racquet or paddle, cue tip, materials of construction, aerodynamics, and projectile advancements as the sole means for helping improve the sportsman's game. Many modern racquets, paddles, and bats are designed to be more forgiving when a sportsman does not hit the ball in the sports equipment's sweet spot, or makes an errant throw. However, modern racquets, paddle heads, cue sticks, bat bodies, dart bodies, and archery/firearm designs do very little to help a sportsman consistently hit the ball in the sports equipment's sweet spot or make consistent accurate shots or throws.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Interestingly, the sports industry has ignored the only physical connection between the sportsman and the sports equipment (i.e., the sports equipment handle) as a vehicle for solving the problem of a sportsman's game performance. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle solves the problem by providing at least one tactile structure that harnesses the innate attributes and processes of the sportsman's body.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In its most general configuration, the presently disclosed sport equipment handle advances the state of the art with a variety of new capabilities and overcomes many of the shortcomings of prior devices in new and novel ways. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle overcomes the shortcomings and limitations of the prior art in any of a number of generally effective configurations. The presently disclosed sport equipment handle demonstrates such capabilities and overcomes many of the shortcomings of prior methods in new and novel ways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The present disclosure relates to a sport equipment handle that provides a user with tactile biofeedback. The sport equipment handle includes a handle body having an upper portion, a lower portion, a handle length, a proximal end, a distal end, and an exterior body surface. The exterior body surface is defined by a first octant, a second octant, a third octant, a fourth octant, a fifth octant, a sixth octant, a seventh octant, and an eighth octant. The sports equipment handle includes at least a tactile reference indentation or projection that extends longitudinally along the exterior body surface. The tactile reference indentation or projection is formed with dimensions specifically tailored to harness the user's natural attributes of sensibility, proprioception, and neuromuscular memory to enable the user to consistently hit a projectile with accuracy, throw a projectile with accuracy, or shoot a projectile with accuracy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">These drawings are provided to assist in the understanding of the exemplary embodiments of the presently disclosed sports equipment handle as described in more detail below and should not be construed as unduly limiting the sports equipment handle and system. In particular, the relative spacing, positioning, sizing and dimensions of the various elements illustrated in the drawings are not drawn to scale and may have been exaggerated, reduced or otherwise modified for the purpose of improved clarity. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that a range of alternative configurations have been omitted simply to improve the clarity and reduce the number of drawings.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">A sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) that provides a user with tactile biofeedback enables a significant advance in the state of the art. The preferred embodiments of the device accomplish this by new and novel arrangements of elements and methods that are configured in unique and novel ways and which demonstrate previously unavailable but preferred and desirable capabilities. The detailed description set forth below in connection with the drawings is intended merely as a description of the presently preferred embodiments of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), and is not intended to represent the only form in which the present sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth the designs, functions, means, and methods of gripping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and features may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-30</figref> illustrate numerous embodiments of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) that provides a user with tactile biofeedback. The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) includes at least one tactile structure specifically tailored to exploit and harness the innate attributes and processes of the human body to allow the user to consistently hit, throw, or shoot a projectile with accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A), an embodiment of a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) on a baseball bat is illustrated. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A), the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) includes a handle body (<b>101</b>) having an upper portion (<b>102</b>), a lower portion (<b>103</b>), a handle length (<b>110</b>), a proximal end (<b>120</b>), a distal end (<b>130</b>), and an exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). The upper portion (<b>102</b>) and the lower portion (<b>103</b>) correspond to the portion of the handle body (<b>101</b>) that is above the midpoint of the handle length (<b>110</b>) and below the midpoint of the handle length (<b>110</b>), respectively. Generally, for a right-handed user using a conventional gripping style, the upper portion (<b>102</b>) is where a majority of the user's left hand would grasp the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and the lower portion (<b>103</b>) is where a majority of the user's right hand would grasp the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment the handle body (<b>101</b>) has a substantially circular cross-section throughout the handle length (<b>110</b>), however the present invention is not limited to circular handles. The exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) is defined by a first octant (<b>161</b>), a second octant (<b>162</b>), a third octant (<b>163</b>), a fourth octant (<b>164</b>), a fifth octant (<b>165</b>), a sixth octant (<b>166</b>), a seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and an eighth octant (<b>168</b>). The octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>) are defined by the intersection of four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>), with each vertical plane (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) spaced 45 degrees from the adjacent vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>), as seen well in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Preferably, the four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) intersect at the geometric center of the proximal end (<b>120</b>), i.e., the butt end, of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>); however the planes may be positioned to pass the a cross-sectional centroid of the handle. The four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) may be rotated about the geometric center of the proximal end (<b>120</b>) to define a position of the octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>). Moreover, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may include visual indicia, such as painted lines, on the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) that visually delineates the octants (<b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>168</b>). The tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b> have flat sidewalls and a flat bottom, but this is not necessary. The tactile reference indentations may have a “V” shaped cross-section or even a curved bottom cross-section, it is more important that the surface edges of the tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) have very small, or no, radius of curvature so that the edges are very distinct. In one embodiment, radius of curvature from the indentation (<b>200</b>) sidewall to the adjacent handle, or grip, surface is 0.35 millimeters or less. Such a dimension for the radius of curvature accommodates two-point discrimination by making the edge relatively fine and thus capable of distinction by feel. In another embodiment this radius of curvature is zero, meaning that the indentation and the adjacent handle, or grip, meet at a distinct line. In an even further embodiment, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the indentation (<b>200</b>) sidewalls meet the adjacent handle, or grip, surface at substantially a 90 degree angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As seen in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A), the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) includes at least a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>). The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) has a tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>), a tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>), and a tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> (A) and <b>2</b>. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to a first tactile octant selected from the group consisting of the first octant (<b>161</b>), the second octant (<b>162</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and the eighth octant (<b>168</b>). In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the first tactile octant is the second octant (<b>162</b>) and the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to the second octant (<b>162</b>). However, the first tactile octant may be the first octant (<b>161</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), or the eighth octant (<b>168</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In this particular embodiment, there is only the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant. It should be noted that while this particular embodiment includes “only” the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant, this does not mean that the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) cannot have additional surface patterns, texture changes, or other similar features. When the term “only” is used in connection with describing a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in certain tactile octants (i.e., “there is only the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) in the first octant”), it means that the tactile octants do not contain any additional palpable indicia adjacent to the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>). The term palpable indicia, as used throughout this specification, means a structure having a depth or height of at least 0.4 millimeters, a width of at least 1.0 millimeters, and a length of at least 25 millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In another embodiment of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may include a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> (B) and <b>3</b>. The tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) has a tactile reference projection length (<b>310</b> <i>a</i>), tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>), and a tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to a first tactile octant selected from the group consisting of the first octant (<b>161</b>), the second octant (<b>162</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), and the eighth octant (<b>168</b>). As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in this embodiment the first tactile octant is the second octant (<b>162</b>) and the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) is confined to the second octant (<b>162</b>). However, the first tactile octant may also be the first octant (<b>161</b>), the third octant (<b>163</b>), the fourth octant (<b>164</b>), the fifth octant (<b>165</b>), the sixth octant (<b>166</b>), the seventh octant (<b>167</b>), or the eighth octant (<b>168</b>). The tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b> have flat sidewalls and a flat top, but this is not necessary. The tactile reference projections may have virtually any cross-sectional shape provided that the outermost surface has two relatively well defined longitudinal edges. In other words, while the intersection of the sidewall surfaces to the adjacent handle, or grip, may be smooth and nondistinct, it is more important that the edges along the outermost surface of the tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) have very small, or no, radius of curvature so that the edges are very distinct. In one embodiment, radius of curvature from the projection (<b>300</b>) sidewall to the outermost surface of the projection (<b>300</b>) is 0.35 millimeters or less. Such a dimension for the radius of curvature accommodates two-point discrimination by making the edge relatively fine and thus capable of distinction by feel. In another embodiment this radius of curvature is zero, meaning that the projection and the adjacent projection sidewall meet at a distinct line. In an even further embodiment, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the projection (<b>300</b>) sidewalls meet the adjacent outermost surface at substantially a 90 degree angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In this particular embodiment, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is only the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant. It should be noted that while this particular embodiment includes “only” the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) in the first tactile octant, this does not mean that the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) cannot have additional surface patterns, texture changes, or other similar features. When the term “only” is used in connection with describing a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) in certain tactile octants (i.e., “there is only the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) in the first octant”), it means that the tactile octants do not contain any additional palpable indicia adjacent the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) and the tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) are at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters, and the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) and tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) are at least 0.5 millimeters. These specific dimensions are important because they exploit several of the user's normal human body attributes to enable the user to consistently grip a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and recognize the position of the handle in space, thereby improving a user's ability to hit, or throw, a projectile with accuracy. The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) enhances users perception and awareness of the “spatial” relationship of the instrument attached to the handle (<b>100</b>) allowing for improved performance. These attributes include sensibility, proprioception, and neuromuscular memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Sensibility is the body's ability to determine fine objects by feel. This ability is measured by what is known as two-point discrimination. Two-point discrimination is defined as the ability to discern that two nearby objects touching the skin are truly two distinct points, not one. The test for two-point discrimination is usually performed utilizing two sharp points. Typically, a person has the most sensibility on their finger pads and lips. A normal measurement for two-point discrimination on the finger pads is a width of 2.0 millimeters to 5.0 millimeters, while other body parts, such as the back, have much larger measurements due to less nerve endings. When the two points are closer together than the range of two-point discrimination a person cannot tell whether they are being contacted by one point or two points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Proprioception is the unconscious perception of movement and spatial orientation arising from stimuli within the body itself. For humans, these stimuli are detected by nerves within the body, such as in joints, tendons, and muscles. A practical example of proprioception is the ability to close one's eyes and touch the index fingers of both hands together without looking. As a result of proprioception, the human body has the ability to know exactly where it is in space. The human body also has the ability to remember and repeat past movements, which are referred to as neuromuscular memory. As sensations are recorded by the body and movements are repeated over time, the body develops an ability to repeat movements without conscious effort.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A user's connection to a piece of sports equipment is established by what they perceive through the handle. The presently disclosed sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) harnesses a user's sensibility by providing at least a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) to create an intimate connection between at least one of the user's hands and the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As previously mentioned, the tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) and the tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters, which, importantly, corresponds to the normal range for two-point discrimination on the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm to provide the user with tactile biofeedback. Moreover, most humans do not have the ability to perceive a structure having a depth of less than 0.5 millimeters and a width of less than 2.0 millimeters with the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm. As a result, providing at least a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) with a tactile reference indentation width (<b>220</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection width (<b>320</b> <i>a</i>) of at least 2.0 millimeters and no greater than 5.0 millimeters and a tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) of at least 0.5 millimeters, which provides the highest level of sensibility, allows the finger pads, thumb, and/or palm to function as high level neurological information collectors. The finger pads, thumb, and/or palm, as high level neurological information collectors, are able to recognize the location and orientation of the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), which is in the same spatial relationship as the sports equipment handle. In sports in which the players typically wear gloves the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) may be increased to overcome the loss of sensitivity as a result of the glove layer. In one embodiment directed to gloved sports the tactile reference indentation depth (<b>230</b> <i>a</i>) or tactile reference projection height (<b>330</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 1.0 millimeter, and more preferably at least 2.0 millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Due to the intimate connection and the high level of sensibility provided by the specifically tailored tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the sports equipment becomes like an extension of the user's body. At this point, the user's natural ability of proprioception is engaged, which allows the user to unconsciously perceive and spontaneously direct the sports equipment's movement in space due to the high level of sensibility provided by tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) extending longitudinally along the exterior body surface (<b>160</b>) of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As a result, the user will know where the sports equipment is in space and can make conscious, or even unconscious, adjustments to ensure that the projectile is consistently hit, or thrown, with accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Additionally, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) builds upon the beneficial attributes provided by the high level of sensibility and proprioception by utilizing the user's natural capacity for neuromuscular memory. When a user grasps the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and makes a swing, throw, or aligns to take a shot, the user obtains neuromuscular memory from the sensations recorded in the hands via the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), in addition to registering the entire body's spatial relationships through proprioception. This information is stored and fed back through the body to the hands so the various muscles and joints are able to repeat the recorded performance to be transferred to the sports equipment via the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As a result, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) allows the user to build neuromuscular memory to consistently strike, throw, or shoot a projectile with increased accuracy. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) provide heightened neurosensory input to facilitate proprioception and muscle memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) on a piece of sports equipment may be custom tailored to the end users specifications such that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) coincides with a pre-selected, user preferred, hand and finger placement on the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). As such, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) additionally performs a “reminder” function. For example, the user will be able to feel the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) and know whether they are grasping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) with their preferred hand and finger placement. By knowing that the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) coincides with the preferred hand and finger placement and being able to tactilely perceive tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>), the user will have a higher level of psychomotor confidence, which results in hitting, throwing, or shooting a projectile with better accuracy. In fact, when the user grasps the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the skin of their fingers, thumb, and/or palm will minimally sink into the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>). As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a dermal imprint (<b>15</b>) is formed when grasping the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). The dermal imprint (<b>15</b>) provides a very subtle and precise psychomotor alignment “read” for the user at the microdermal neurosensory level, which ultimately leads to better movement of the sports equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In one embodiment, the tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>) is at least 50 percent of the handle length (<b>110</b>). Having a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) that extends along at least 50 percent of the handle length (<b>110</b>) accommodates the numerous styles of hand positioning and gripping used to grasp a piece of sports equipment. Such a tactile reference indentation length (<b>210</b> <i>a</i>) maximizes the opportunity for the user's hands and fingers to come into contact with the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) to receive maximum psychomotor tactile biofeedback.</div>

Generally, the second tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>b</i>) should be spaced from the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) by at least a 10 degree angle, as measured from the point of intersection between the four imaginary vertical planes (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>), which point of intersection would typically be the geometric center of the proximal end (<b>120</b>), i.e., the butt end, of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) from a top plan view. Such spacing ensures that first and second tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>, <b>200</b> <i>b</i>) are not so close together that a user would not be able to discern by tactile perception the two distinct tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>, <b>200</b> <i>b</i>).</div>

The discussion above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> will not be repeated here but merely referenced as applying to all the embodiments disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">In one embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) located in the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) is preferably located within twenty-four inches of the ball-striking tip of the cue stick, and the length (<b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) is at least six inches. In another embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) located in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>) is preferably located within twenty-four inches of the butt-end of the cue stick, and the length (<b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) is at least six inches. A right handed player will typically grip the cue stick with the right hand in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>), while using their left hand to guide the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) of the cue stick throughout the stroke. In a further embodiment the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) extends majority of the length of the pool cue with no distinction between a separate indentation or projection in the top section (<b>110</b> <i>a</i>) or the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Generally professional pool players do not rotate the pool cue when making a stroke with the pool cue. However new players almost always rotate the pool cue one direction when pulling back to make a pool shot, and then rotate the pool cue back during the actual pool shot. Unfortunately, the rotation of the pool cue increases the likelihood of inaccurate shots. In addition to all the benefits discussed above, tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) and/or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) on a pool cue help the pool player become aware of any rotating motion during a pool shot, thereby resulting in a more accurate ball strikes. The tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) and/or projection (<b>300</b>) allow the user to deliver the pool cue without rotation and in an exact preselected spot on the cue ball to create the direction and rotation desired. Further, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) in the bottom section (<b>110</b> <i>b</i>) provides the user with a greater sense of whether the stroke of the cue stick is in perfect alignment with the desired direction of ball travel, or if the stroke of the cue stick is cutting across the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The end of a pool cue is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be produced from a variety of materials. By way of example only, and not limitation, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be constructed of any conventional handle material, such as wood, metal, rubber, synthetic rubber, polymers, composites, and combinations thereof. The hardness of these types of materials is most commonly measured by the Shore (Durometer) test. Shore Hardness, using either the Shore A or Shore D scale, is the preferred method for rubbers/elastomers. The Shore A scale is used for “softer” rubbers while the Shore D scale is used for “harder” ones. The Shore hardness is measured with an apparatus known as a Durometer and consequently is also known as “Durometer hardness.” The hardness value is determined by the penetration of the Durometer indenter foot into the sample. The ASTM test method designation is ASTM D2240 00 and is generally used in North America. Related methods include ISO 7619 and ISO 868; DIN 53505; and JIS K 6301, which was discontinued and superceeded by JIS K 6253.</div>

Thus, in one embodiment the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and/or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) has a durometer value greater than 60 Shore A on the hardness scale to ensure that the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>), the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>), and/or the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) is significantly harder than the portion of the human hand, and therefore the tactile reference indentation and/or projection is even more perceivable. In an even further embodiment the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) has a durometer value of at least 65 Shore A on the hardness scale to ensure that the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) is significantly harder than the portion of the human hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">Thus, one skilled in the art will appreciate that an even further embodiment consists of at least one tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) that may be applied to the handle of a preexisting piece of sports equipment. For instance, one embodiment may incorporate a kit of one or more one tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) that may be adhered to the handle of an ordinary piece of sports equipment. For example, a user may apply a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) to the handle of a standard baseball bat, or any other piece of sports equipment, to determine if the addition of the tactile reference projection (<b>300</b>) improves their ball striking, throwing, or shooting. Alternatively, the tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be formed in the handle of piece of sports equipment utilizing traditional handle manufacturing processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">In the case of a grip applied over a handle, or a nonmetallic handle, the grip, handle, or tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b>) or projection (<b>300</b>) may be made of rubber, synthetic rubber or polymers, which may be produced by injection molding or extrusion molding. Often conventional handle molding techniques are limited in their ability to produce a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) having a tactile reference indentation (<b>200</b> <i>a</i>) or a tactile reference projection (<b>300</b> <i>a</i>) with distinct sharp edges, i.e., zero radius edges. Therefore, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be formed by a molding process followed by a CNC machining process. Additionally, the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) may be produced by an advanced compression molding process, laser cutting, or a water jet. Furthermore, a sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) that is made out of wood, metal, or composites, and combinations thereof may be formed by CNC machining, laser cutting, and or water jet cutting to form the basic shape of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) and any tactile reference indentations (<b>200</b>) or tactile reference projections (<b>300</b>) found thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Thus far the disclosure has included baseball bat embodiments, ping pong paddle embodiments, badminton racquet embodiments, tennis racquet embodiments, racquetball racquet embodiments, cricket bat embodiments, pool cue embodiments, dart embodiments, and archery/firearm embodiments; one skilled in the art will appreciated that the disclosure applies equally to the squash racquets, curling stone handles, pole vaulting pole handles, lacrosse stick handles, handles for water sport paddles such as kayak and canoe paddle handles, fishing rod handles and grips, fly fishing rod handles and grips, motorcycle and snowmobile handles and grips, discuses, javelins, and hammers which are included herein without the need for repetitive discussion. Numerous alterations, modifications, and variations of the preferred embodiments disclosed herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art and they are all anticipated and contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>). For example, although specific embodiments have been described in detail, those with skill in the art will understand that the preceding embodiments and variations can be modified to incorporate various types of substitute and or additional or alternative materials, relative arrangement of elements, and dimensional configurations. Accordingly, even though only few variations of the sports equipment handle (<b>100</b>) are described herein, it is to be understood that the practice of such additional modifications and variations and the equivalents thereof, are within the spirit and scope of the invention.</div>
