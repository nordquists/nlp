<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment of the present invention is a sports activity device adapted to be both a flying disc and a racquet-like apparatus. The device includes an annular outer ring having an outer surface and an annular groove in the outer surface. An annular inner ring is detachably connectable with the outer ring and defines a central opening in the inner ring. A flexible material is secured to the inner ring and extends across the central opening of the inner ring and creates a trampoline surface that stretches across the central opening of the inner ring. The inner ring is received in the groove of the outer ring, to detachably connect the inner ring and thereby the flexible material to the outer ring. The groove has an irregular configuration defined by a series of side surfaces intersecting with each other and with the outer surface of the outer ring. The inner ring has an irregular configuration including a plurality of relatively movable flanges that engage at least one of the side surfaces of the groove to resist removal of the inner from the groove thereby to resist disconnection of the inner ring from the outer ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In that embodiment, the groove may have an outer portion and an inner, undercut portion that is axially offset from the outer portion of the groove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The relatively movable portions of the inner ring may include a side portion, an upper flange, and a lower flange, the upper flange extending inward and downward from the upper end of the side portion, and the lower flange extending inward and upward from the lower end of the side portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The groove may include an outer portion and an inner, undercut portion that is axially offset from the outer portion of the groove. A plurality of the relatively movable portions of the inner ring are resiliently insertable into the undercut and are compressed together in response to a removing force that is applied to separate the inner ring from the outer ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, the outer ring may be made from EVA foam or from TPR foam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the outer ring has a toroidal configuration centered on an axis, and the outer surface of the ring includes an upper side surface, an outer side surface that is farthest from the axis, a lower side surface, and an inner side surface that is closest to the axis. The groove extends downward from the upper side surface of the outer ring and is defined by a series of interconnected surfaces including a generally flat first surface that extends downward from the upper side surface of the outer ring and that is closest to the axis; a generally flat second surface that is lowermost and that extends axially outward from the first surface; a curved third surface that extends upward and axially inward from the second surface; and a generally flat fourth surface that extends from the third surface upward to the upper side surface of the ring. The groove as thus formed includes an outer portion that is located above the third surface, and an undercut portion that is located below the fourth surface and axially offset from the outer portion of the groove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The relatively movable portions of the inner ring may include a side portion, an upper flange, and a lower flange, the upper flange extending inward and downward from the upper end of the side portion and terminating in an upper flange edge, and the lower flange extending inward and upward from the lower end of the side portion and terminating in a lower flange edge. The side portion of the inner ring may engage the first surface of the groove, and the upper flange and the lower flange of the inner ring may resiliently engage the third surface of the groove in the undercut portion of the groove to resist movement of the inner ring of the groove. The upper flange edge and the lower flange edge may engage the fourth surface of the groove during insertion of the inner ring into the groove and thereafter resiliently engage in the undercut portion of the groove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the invention is a sports activity device adapted to be both a flying disc and a racquet-like apparatus. The device includes an annular outer ring centered on an axis and having an outer surface and an annular groove in the outer surface. An annular inner ring centered on the axis is detachably connected with the outer ring and defines a central opening in the inner ring. A flexible material is secured to the inner ring and extends across the central opening of the inner ring and creates a trampoline surface that stretches across the central opening of the inner ring. The inner ring is received in the groove of the outer ring to detachably connect the inner ring and thereby the flexible material to the outer ring. The groove includes an undercut in the material of the outer ring that is located on the axially outer side of the groove. The inner ring includes a portion that engages in the undercut to resist removal of the inner ring from the groove thereby to resist removal of the inner ring from the outer ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In that embodiment, the inner ring may include a plurality of relatively movable flanges that fit into the undercut and that are resiliently deformed upon assembly of the outer ring with the inner ring to resist removal of the inner ring from the groove. The outer ring may be made from EVA foam of from TPR foam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">A further embodiment of the invention is a flying disk toy including an annular outer ring centered on an axis; an annular inner ring connected with the outer ring; and a flexible material secured to the inner ring and creating a trampoline surface. The inner ring is detachably received in a groove in the outer ring, the groove having an undercut, and the inner ring having relatively movable flanges that engage in the undercut in the groove to resist removal of the inner ring from the groove.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Description will now be given with reference to the attached <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. These figures are exemplary in nature and in no way serve to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the claims appearing hereinbelow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">This invention relates to a racquet-like flying disk toy. In particular, this invention relates to a racquet-like flying disk toy with a removable trampoline center portion. The invention is applicable to disk toys of different constructions. As representative of the invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a disk toy <b>10</b> that is one embodiment of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The disk <b>10</b> includes generally three pieces: an outer ring <b>12</b>, an inner ring <b>14</b>, and a membrane <b>16</b>. The outer ring <b>12</b> is preferably molded as one piece from EVA foam in the form of a toroid, centered on an axis <b>18</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Other materials can be used; one alternative material is TPR foam (thermoplastic rubber foam). Specifically, the outer ring is initially formed in a mold with about 40% of its ultimate volume, then when released from the mold, expands to its final volume and configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The outer ring <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has a generally ovoid cross-sectional configuration with an exterior surface <b>20</b>. The exterior surface <b>20</b> can be considered to include an upper side surface <b>22</b>, an outer side surface <b>24</b> (farthest from the axis <b>18</b>), a lower side surface <b>26</b>, and an inner side surface <b>28</b> (closest to the axis <b>18</b>). (The terms upper and lower, as used herein, refer to the toy <b>10</b> when in an orientation as shown in the drawings. Clearly, if the toy <b>10</b> is inverted, the surfaces are reversed. The terms upper and lower thus are not limiting, but are rather used only for convenience when referring to the drawings.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">An annular groove <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is formed in the solid material of the outer ring <b>12</b>. The groove <b>30</b> extends downward from the upper side surface <b>22</b>, closer to the inner side surface <b>28</b> than to the outer side surface <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The groove <b>30</b> has an irregular configuration defined by an interior surface <b>31</b> on the outer ring <b>12</b>. The interior surface <b>31</b> is constituted as a series of interconnected individual, annular surfaces that include a generally flat first surface <b>32</b> extending downward from the upper side surface <b>22</b>. The first surface <b>32</b> is radially innermost, that is, closest to the axis <b>18</b> as seen in cross section. A generally flat second surface <b>34</b> is lowermost in the groove <b>30</b> and extends radially outward from the first surface <b>32</b>. A curved third surface <b>36</b> extends upward and radially inward from the second surface <b>34</b>. A generally flat fourth surface <b>38</b> extends upward from the third surface <b>36</b> and intersects the upper side surface <b>22</b> of the outer ring <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The groove <b>30</b> as thus formed includes an outer portion <b>40</b> that is located above the third surface <b>36</b>. The groove <b>30</b> also includes an inner, undercut portion <b>42</b> that is located below the fourth surface <b>38</b>. The term “undercut” is used because the outer ring <b>12</b> includes solid material as indicated at <b>44</b> that is located radially inward of the third surface <b>36</b>. The undercut portion <b>42</b> of the groove <b>30</b> is formed during the molding process described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The inner ring <b>14</b> is an extrusion formed from a single linear piece having a length approximately equal to the circumference of the inner ring <b>14</b>, with the two ends being joined by a pin (not shown) or other means. Preferred materials include polypropylene and polyethylene. The inner ring <b>14</b> has an irregular configuration (for example, non-circular, non-ovoid, non-rectangular) including a plurality of relatively movable flanges that, as described below, engage the interior surface <b>31</b> of the groove to resist removal of the inner ring from the groove thereby to resist removal of the inner ring from the outer ring <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Specifically, the inner ring <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) includes a side portion <b>46</b> that is radially outermost on the inner ring. The side portion <b>46</b> extends generally parallel to the axis <b>18</b>. The inner ring <b>14</b> also includes an upper flange <b>48</b>. The upper flange <b>48</b> has a first portion <b>50</b> that extends inward and slightly downward from the upper end of the side portion <b>46</b>. A second portion <b>52</b> of the upper flange <b>48</b> extends from the first portion <b>50</b> and curls back toward the side portion <b>46</b> and abuts the side portion <b>46</b>. A third portion <b>54</b> of the upper flange <b>48</b> extends from the second portion <b>52</b> in a direction away from the side portion <b>46</b> and terminates in an upper flange edge <b>56</b> that is preferably relatively sharp as illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The inner ring <b>12</b> also includes a lower flange <b>60</b> that extends inward and upward from the lower end of the side portion <b>46</b> and that terminates in a lower flange edge <b>62</b> that may be relatively sharp as illustrated. The two flanges <b>48</b> and <b>60</b> of the inner ring <b>12</b> are resiliently movable relative to each other and to the side portion <b>46</b> of the inner ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The membrane <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the illustrated embodiment is an elastic fabric and thus serves as a trampoline member. Other fabrics or membranes could, alternatively, be used. The membrane <b>16</b> is sewn to the inner ring <b>14</b> by stitching <b>70</b> extending through the upper flange <b>46</b> and the side portion <b>46</b> of the inner ring. Other forms of attachment could be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The configuration of the inner ring <b>14</b> and the configuration of the groove <b>30</b> are selected so that the inner ring <b>14</b> can be securely, but removably, fitted into the outer ring <b>12</b>. Specifically, to assemble the two pieces, the inner ring <b>14</b> is moved into the groove <b>30</b> (downward as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>). The side portion <b>46</b> of the inner ring <b>14</b> engages and slides downward along the first surface <b>32</b> of the groove <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The lower flange <b>60</b> of the inner ring <b>14</b> engages the fourth surface <b>38</b> of the groove <b>30</b> and is bent back toward the inner ring side portion <b>46</b>. The lower flange <b>60</b> moves into the undercut portion <b>42</b> of the groove <b>30</b>. The resilience of the lower flange <b>60</b> causes the lower flange to snap or bend back out away from the inner ring side portion <b>46</b>. The lower flange edge <b>62</b> presses against and digs into the third surface <b>36</b> of the groove <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The upper flange <b>48</b> of the inner ring <b>14</b>, as it enters the groove <b>30</b>, engages the fourth surface <b>38</b> and is compressed or bent back toward and against the inner ring side portion <b>46</b>. The third portion <b>54</b> of the upper flange <b>48</b> moves into the undercut portion <b>42</b> of the groove <b>30</b>. The resilience of the upper flange <b>48</b> causes the upper flange edge <b>56</b> to press against and dig into the third surface <b>36</b> of the groove <b>30</b>. Simultaneously, the resilience of the upper flange <b>48</b> causes the second portion <b>52</b> of the upper flange to press against the fourth surface <b>38</b> of the groove <b>30</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The engagement of the two flanges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> with the third surface <b>36</b> of the groove <b>30</b> resists movement of the inner ring <b>14</b> out of the groove (upward as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>), enough to keep the inner ring and thus the membrane secured to the outer ring <b>12</b> when the disk <b>10</b> is in use. The portions of the inner ring <b>14</b> that are in the undercut portion <b>42</b> of the groove <b>30</b>, which resiliently insertable into the undercut, are compressed together in response to any removing force that is applied to separate the inner ring from the outer ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">When the disk <b>10</b> is being used in a racquet-like manner, e.g., a ball or similar object is striking off of the membrane <b>16</b>, the force of the impact of the ball or other object against the membrane is insufficient to dislodge the inner ring <b>14</b> from the outer ring <b>12</b>. With the use of sufficient force, the inner ring <b>14</b> can be pried out of the groove <b>30</b>, to remove the membrane and inner ring from the outer ring <b>12</b>, thereby to enable those two pieces to be used separately from each other. As a result, a replacement membrane <b>14</b> can be selectively attached to an inner ring <b>14</b> for purposes of repair, or desired color change, or desired change of logo, or for other reasons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention is not limited to the above description or the illustrated embodiment. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the claims appearing hereinbelow and includes any equivalents thereof as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
