<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/350,959, entitled “Sports Training Device”, filed on Jun. 16, 2016, and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/390,125, entitled “Big-R-Hitter”, filed on Mar. 21, 2016, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates, generally, to sports exercise equipment. More specifically, it relates to a device that exercises muscles and improves performance in sports that require swinging an apparatus such as a club, bat, stick, or racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Sports training devices are known in the art for aiding in the swinging motion of a piece of sporting equipment, such as a baseball bat. However, they fail to teach or suggest a mechanism that allows the full range of motion without becoming entangled around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One such device is U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,918 to Rupnik et al. This device teaches an attachment to a golf club that only provides air resistance when the club is swung incorrectly. This device attempts to eliminate the slice in a golf swing. Also, the air foil in this invention is made of a stiff material and therefore does not freely move about the shaft based on a user's unique swing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">A previous patent obtained by the Applicant (U.S. Pat. No. 8,202,204 to Celone et al.) teaches an apparatus that is attached by coupling links affixed to the shaft of the club. It also alleges 360° motion about the shaft; however, the device could become entangled around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racket, due to the ends of the drag chute being capable of rotating at different speeds, independent of each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,384,344 to Aguirre teaches an apparatus that includes a drag chute that is filled with air and kept from becoming entangled by its booms and is attached to a shaft by boom mounts. However, the device in Aguirre does not attach to the club, bat, stick, or racket. Therefore, a user cannot practice hitting the ball as in golf, baseball and tennis, or hit the puck in hockey. This is a serious drawback if the user's goal is to train for a specific sport. Further, the mechanism by which the drag chute couples to the club appears to be quite complex, but it functions for its own purpose since a user cannot remove the training device from the club; rather, it is manufactured to be affixed on the club, thus permitting a greater flexibility for how the training device can be structured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, what is needed is a device that allows a full, 360° range of motion around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racket to provide the proper air resistance for training no matter how a person swings the club, bat, stick, or racket. Previous devices have allowed for 360° motion; however, these devices must utilize a static air foil or risk becoming entangled around the shaft of the club, bat, stick, or racket. In view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the field of this invention how the shortcomings of the prior art could be overcome.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a sports exercise device that attaches to the elongate shaft of a swinging sports equipment (e.g., club, bat, stick, or racket) by way of annular attachment or a functional equivalent, rotates 360°, and is supported by elongated rods is now met by a new, useful, and nonobvious invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the current invention is a swinging sports exercise/training device for attaching to a shaft of a sports apparatus. The swinging sports exercise/training device includes a proximal attachment mechanism and a distal attachment mechanism, which may be annular in shape. The proximal attachment mechanism is positioned, such that at least a portion of it rotates 360° about a proximal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus. The distal attachment mechanism is positioned to rotate about a distal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus. The distal attachment mechanism has an inner diameter that is larger than the outer diameter of the distal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus, such that the entirety of the distal attachment mechanism substantially freely rotates 360° about the sports apparatus. In an embodiment, the proximal attachment mechanism can have an inner diameter that is smaller than the largest outer diameter of the shaft of the sports apparatus, and the distal attachment mechanism can have an inner diameter that is larger than the largest outer diameter of the shaft of the sports apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The swinging sports exercise/training device further includes first and second elongated rods (e.g., Young's modulus of at least 10 GPa), each having a proximal and a distal end. The rods are disposed so that the proximal ends are attached to opposing ends of the proximal attachment mechanism and the distal ends are secured to a stiffener element (e.g., corner attachment mechanism, handle formed of a front handle component and a rear handle component) positioned at the distal end of the training device. Optionally, the rods can be disposed through the distal attachment mechanism as well. The rotation of the attachment mechanisms is synchronized with the rotation of the elongated rods. The mechanisms and the rods rotate around the center axis of the sports apparatuses. Optionally, the rods can be symmetrical with respect to each other about the center axis of the sports apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The swinging sports exercise/training device further includes a panel with a proximal end secured to the proximal end of the training device and a distal end secured to the distal end of the training device. The panel's proximal end is attached to the proximal attachment mechanism, and the panel's distal end is attached to the stiffener element (e.g., if the stiffener handle is a handle formed of a front handle component and a rear handle component, the distal edge of the panel can be secured therebetween). Optionally, the panel can be substantially taut when the training device is in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">With this configuration, the training device can rotate about the shaft of the sports apparatus in a direction normal to a velocity vector of a swing so that the user of the sports apparatus experiences an increased resistance during the swing. Further, the rotating portion of the proximal attachment mechanism, the distal attachment mechanism, the stiffener element, the elongated rods, and the panel collectively rotate in synchronization with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The proximal attachment mechanism of the training device may include an inner bearing and outer bearing, where the inner bearing is immovably secured around the proximal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus and the outer bearing is disposed around the inner bearing and rotatable about both the inner bearing and the proximal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus. In a further embodiment, the proximal attachment mechanism may further include a collar and a collar cap that house the inner and outer bearings. In yet another embodiment, the inner and outer bearing may each include a raised lip, such that the inner bearing raised lip is seated on the outer bearing raised lip in order to prevent the inner bearing from withdrawing out of the outer bearing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The distal attachment mechanism may be formed of a collar and a collar cap disposed around the distal portion of the shaft of the sports apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the length of the first elongated rod is substantially parallel to one side edge of the panel, and the length of the second elongated rod is substantially parallel to the other side edge of the panel. In a further embodiment, the panel can have a trapezoidal shape, such that the elongated rods are disposed oblique to each other along the side edges of the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In a separate embodiment, the current invention is a swinging sports exercise and training device for attaching to a shaft of a sports apparatus, where the device includes any one or more, or even all, of the foregoing characteristics and features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other important objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become clear as this disclosure proceeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the disclosure set forth hereinafter and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term “or” is generally employed in its sense including “and/or” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention is a swinging sports exercise and training device designed for attachment to the shaft of a swinging sports apparatus, such as a baseball bat. The invention will be described and illustrated herein as applied to a baseball bat, but it can be understood how the device can be applied to other swinging sports apparatuses as well. The device has two connection points (proximal and distal connection points) on the bat and slides over the handle of the bat until both connection points are positioned around the shaft of the bat. The term “proximal” is used herein to refer to a relative position of a structural component being closer to a user of the underlying swinging sports apparatus, whereas the term “distal” is used herein to refer to a relative position of a structural component being further from the user of the underlying swinging sports apparatus. The proximal connection point typically is disposed near one end of the device. The distal connection point is disposed either near the opposite end of the device or in the middle of the device, with other components disposed distal to the distal connection point. This latter configuration will become clearer as this specification continues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Once both connection points are positioned around the shaft of the bat, the training device continues to slide distally until an inner bearing in the proximal connection point tightens around the shaft of the bat to secure the device to the bat. This typically occurs when the diameter of the shaft of the bat increases to where the shaft abuts the inner perimeter of the proximal connection point and the proximal connection point fits snugly around the shaft. The distal connection point can have an inner diameter that is larger than the largest outer diameter of the bat, thus allowing the distal connection point to remain loose around the shaft of the bat. In this way, the proximal connection point is the primary mechanism by which the training device is secured to the shaft of the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">A drag chute extends from the proximal connection point of the apparatus to the distal connection point, or alternatively past the distal connection point to the handle or other rigid support member of the device at the opposite (distal) end of the training device. Two support rods, one on each side of the chute, are affixed and disposed between the ends of the training device, for example between the proximal connection point and the distal connection point, or optionally also between proximal connection point and the handle. In the latter configuration, the support rods can be disposed through the distal connection point as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The proximal connection point can rotate 360° in a nearly frictionless manner because an outer bearing is disposed in outer relation to the inner bearing and rotates about the inner bearing of the proximal connection point. A collar and collar cap can house these outer and inner bearings. The distal connection point, formed a collar and collar cap, can also rotate 360° in a nearly frictionless manner because it is semi-loosely positioned around the distal end of the bat, such that it rotates around the distal end of the bat. In other words, the diameter of the upper collar of the distal connection point is larger than the largest diameter of the shaft of the bat. The training device rotates simultaneously around the shaft of the bat (thus eliminating any risk of the chute becoming entangled around the shaft of the bat), due to the support rods ensuring that the two connection points and the chute rotate at the same rate around the shaft of the bat.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>, the current invention is a swing training apparatus, generally denoted by the reference numeral <b>100</b>, as applied to swinging sports apparatus <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is an exploded view of device <b>100</b> from the right side perspective, panel <b>110</b> extends the length of device <b>100</b>. Handle <b>115</b> is formed by front handle <b>116</b> and rear handle <b>121</b>. Handle <b>115</b> is formed of front handle <b>116</b> and rear handle <b>121</b>. Handle <b>115</b> is coupled to and secures third edge <b>113</b> of panel <b>100</b>. Handle <b>115</b> attaches to first elongated rod <b>160</b> at the corner formed by edges <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> of panel <b>110</b>. Handle <b>115</b> attaches to second elongated rod <b>161</b> at the corner formed by edges <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> of panel <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">First elongated rod <b>160</b> is disposed substantially parallel to edge <b>112</b>. Second elongated rod <b>161</b> is disposed substantially parallel to edge <b>114</b>. Elongated rods <b>160</b>, <b>161</b> optionally are not disposed parallel to each other and rather are oblique to one another, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Elongated rods <b>160</b>, <b>161</b> maintain a constant angle with respect to each other (in other words, the distance between rods <b>160</b>, <b>161</b> remains fixed) and are rotatably indirectly coupled to the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b> via first (proximal, lower) attachment mechanism <b>130</b> and second (distal, upper) attachment mechanism <b>150</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">First attachment mechanism <b>130</b> is formed of inner bearing <b>131</b>, outer bearing <b>133</b>, collar <b>136</b>, and collar cap <b>140</b>. Inner bearing <b>133</b> is firmly secured to the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b> when training apparatus <b>100</b> is applied onto sports apparatus <b>10</b>, as previously discussed, thus allowing no movement of inner bearing <b>131</b> about the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b>, typically due to the friction between inner bearing <b>131</b> and the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b>. Outer bearing <b>133</b> is coupled to inner bearing <b>131</b> in a manner to allow outer bearing <b>133</b> to rotate 360° about inner bearing <b>131</b> and thus also the center axis of the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b>. First attachment mechanism collar <b>136</b> houses inner bearing <b>131</b> and outer bearing <b>133</b>. First attachment mechanism collar cap <b>140</b> couples to first attachment mechanism collar <b>136</b> to fully enclose inner bearing <b>131</b> and outer bearing <b>133</b>. Edge <b>111</b> of panel <b>110</b> is disposed in proximity to first attachment mechanism <b>130</b> and has approximately the same length as first attachment mechanism <b>130</b>. Edge <b>111</b> of panel <b>110</b> is coupled to first attachment mechanism <b>130</b> at a proximal end of training apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain embodiments, it is contemplated herein that second attachment mechanism <b>150</b> can take a similar configuration as first attachment mechanism <b>130</b> with the inner bearing secured to sports apparatus <b>10</b> and the outer bearing rotating about the inner bearing. However, if sports apparatus <b>10</b> has varying diameters along its length, as many baseball bats do, a simpler mechanism is presented herein. Second attachment mechanism <b>150</b> can be formed of second attachment mechanism collar <b>151</b> and cap <b>155</b>, and is laxly disposed around the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b>. Second attachment mechanism <b>150</b> has an inner diameter that is larger than the outer diameter of sports apparatus <b>10</b> and thus can substantially freely rotate about the shaft of sports apparatus <b>10</b> during rotation of training apparatus <b>100</b> around sports apparatus <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">As can be seen most clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, elongated rods <b>160</b>, <b>161</b> each have an end affixed/secured to handle <b>115</b> and an opposite end affixed/secured to first attachment mechanism <b>130</b>. By itself, this configuration should maintain the general rigidity of training apparatus <b>100</b> as it rotates about sports apparatus <b>10</b>.

Second attachment mechanism <b>350</b> is laxly disposed around the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b> in a way such that second attachment mechanism <b>350</b> can rotate in a nearly frictionless motion around the shaft.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">First elongated rod <b>360</b> begins and is attached to first attachment mechanism <b>330</b>, is disposed substantially parallel to second edge <b>312</b> of panel <b>310</b>, is disposed through and/or is attached to second attachment mechanism <b>350</b>, and terminates at and is attached to left corner attachment <b>315</b> at the corner of panel <b>310</b> formed by the intersection of second edge <b>312</b> and third edge <b>313</b>. Second elongated rod <b>361</b> begins and is attached to first attachment mechanism <b>330</b>, is disposed substantially parallel to fourth edge <b>314</b> of panel <b>310</b>, is disposed through and/or is attached to second attachment mechanism <b>350</b>, and terminates at and is attached to right corner attachment <b>316</b> at the corner of panel <b>310</b> formed by the intersection of fourth edge <b>314</b> and third edge <b>313</b>. In this way, training apparatus <b>300</b> is configured to rotate 360° around the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>, with exception to inner bearing <b>331</b>, which is secured to the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b> and does not move in any direction during operation of training apparatus <b>300</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, inner bearing <b>331</b>, outer bearing <b>333</b>, and first attachment mechanism collar <b>336</b> are depicted. Inner bearing <b>331</b> can be seen secured around the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b> and does not move in any direction due to the friction between inner bearing <b>331</b> and the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>. As discussed previously, outer bearing <b>333</b> is coupled to and disposed around the perimeter of inner bearing <b>331</b> in a manner that permits 360° rotation of outer bearing <b>333</b> about the center axis of the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>. First attachment mechanism collar <b>336</b> is disposed around outer bearing <b>333</b>, such that the rotation of first attachment mechanism collar <b>336</b> and outer bearing <b>333</b> are synchronized with the remainder of training apparatus <b>300</b>, with exception to inner bearing <b>331</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, second attachment mechanism collar <b>351</b> is laxly disposed around the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>, thus permitting free rotation of second attachment mechanism <b>350</b> about the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>. It is noted that second attachment mechanism <b>350</b> rotates in synchronization with first attachment mechanism <b>330</b> about the shaft of sports apparatus <b>30</b>, due to elongated rods <b>360</b>, <b>361</b> being coupled to corner attachment mechanisms <b>315</b>, <b>316</b> and first attachment mechanism <b>330</b> and disposed through second attachment mechanism <b>350</b>. Thus, the distance between first attachment mechanism <b>330</b> and second attachment mechanism <b>350</b> remains unchanged during operation of training apparatus <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">It is contemplated herein that alternative embodiments of the current training apparatus may use different attachment mechanisms to attach and rotate around the shaft of the sports apparatus. They may also use one or more elongated rods to provide rigidity throughout the length of the training apparatus. Overall, the object is to provide a training apparatus that can be coupled to the shaft of a sports apparatus and rotate 360° about the shaft of the sports apparatus. Thus, the panel/airfoil/chute (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> for an isolated view of panel <b>310</b> having a substantially trapezoidal shape) provides a drag resistance regardless of the direction of swinging of the sports apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">GLOSSARY OF CLAIM TERMS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Annular: This term is used herein to refer to a structure that is shaped like or forms a ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Distal: This term is used herein to refer to a position further from a user operating the underlying sports apparatus and training device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Laxly: This term is used herein to refer to a structural component being loose or having slack, or otherwise not tense, rigid, or firm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Panel: This term is used herein to refer to a typically flexible chute or airfoil that provides air resistance when swinging it in a direction normal to its plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Proximal: This term is used herein to refer to a position closer to a user operating the underlying sports apparatus and training device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Rod: This term is used herein to refer to any shaft or bar having a predefined shape. In certain embodiments, the rod can be secured on one end to the proximal attachment mechanism and secured on its opposite end to the stiffener element (e.g., handle). It is contemplated herein that this configuration includes not only a single rod disposed between the proximal attachment mechanism and the stiffener element but also a rod that is disposed between the proximal and distal attachment mechanisms and another rod disposed between the distal attachment mechanism and the stiffener element. In this latter configuration, it is still contemplated that a rod is disposed between the proximal attachment mechanism and the stiffener element; despite the structure being slightly different, it is considered to be equivalent, and the overall function is same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Simultaneously: This term is used herein to refer to two events occurring at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Sports apparatus: This term is used herein to refer to equipment that is swung during operation thereof when playing a sport. Examples include, but are not limited to, baseball bats, tennis rackets, golf clubs, and hockey sticks, among other suitable equipment. In a preferred embodiment, the sports apparatus has a shaft that has differing diameters/widths along its length. A particular example of this type of sports apparatus is a baseball bat. In this way, the proximal attachment mechanism would have a diameter that is smaller than the largest diameter of the shaft of the sports apparatus, and the distal attachment mechanism would have a diameter that is larger than the largest diameter of the shaft of the sports apparatus, thus allowing the proximal attachment mechanism to be secured to the shaft during operation and the distal attachment mechanism to substantially freely rotate about the shaft during operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Stiffener element: This term is used herein to refer to a structural component that provides a rigidity to an edge of the panel. This rigidity facilitates synchronized rotation of the training device about the shaft of the sports apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Substantially freely rotate: This term is used herein to refer to the ability of a structure component to turn or revolve around a shaft without obstruction or with minimal obstruction. The term “substantially” is used to indicate that the distal attachment mechanism can rotate about the shaft of the sports apparatus but may have contact the sports apparatus during rotation, thus causing minimal friction to be created between the distal attachment mechanism and the sports apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Substantially Taut: This term is used herein to refer to a structural component being stretched, pulled tight, or otherwise lacking slack or having minimal slack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Synchronize: This term is used herein to refer to two events occurring at the same time and with the same speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">The advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained. Since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention that, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.</div>
