<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA104350545">
<div class="abstract">A table tennis bat is formed with a thumb rest projecting sideways from the handle, for accommodating a player's thumb when the bat is gripped. The thumb rest has a U-shaped section, in which the interphalangeal joint of the thumb rests when the player grips the bat. A further section of the thumb rest can be provided to accommodate the end of the player's thumb, and a lip may be provided to prevent the player's thumb from sliding forwards. The thumb rest may be constructed so that it can twist relative to the handle of the bat, and means can be provided to urge the thumb rest towards its original position.</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="WIPO-OCR" mxw-id="PDES55182188">
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0001"> Table Tennis Bat </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0002">The present invention relates to a table tennis bat, and more particularly to a table tennis bat with means for locating a player's digits during play, to improve the grip. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0003"> Figure 1 shows a standard prior art table tennis bat 1 , which has a blade 2 for hitting the ball and a handle 3 to be gripped by a player. One commonly used grip is the "shakehands" grip, in which the fingers of the player's hand are curled around the handle, and the thumb is pointed along the handle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0004"> Table tennis bats are known where the handle has a number of recesses to accommodate the fingers of a player's hand, to ensure that the bat is gripped in a correct fashion. However, regardless of how the bats are gripped, the player must use movement of their wrist to change the position and angle of the bat, and it is difficult to be exact in these movements. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0005"> According to the present invention, there is provided a table tennis bat, wherein the handle of the bat is provided with a projecting thumb rest for positioning the player's thumb. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0006"> With this arrangement, it is possible for a player to use their fingers and thumb to adjust the position, and in particular the angle, of the bat. As it is usually possible to control motion of the fingers and thumb more finely than motion of the wrist, finer control of the position and angle of the bat are possible. Further, a player can have a better "feel" for the position and angle of the bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0007"> In a preferred form, the thumb rest is provided with a U-shaped part, for accommodating the player's thumb in the valley of the U. This allows the thumb to be positioned in a standard way, and prevents the thumb from moving during use of the bat, which would lead to the grip being loosened. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0008"> In a further preferred form, the interphalangeal joint of the thumb rests in the valley of the U-shaped part. This makes it easier to grip the bat, as the thumb can be bent over the rest at the joint. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0009"> Preferably, the thumb rest has a part for supporting the distal phalange of the player's thumb. This makes it more comfortable to grip the bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0010"> Preferably, the part for supporting the distal phalange of the player's thumb is provided with a lip to limit movement of the player's thumb, which helps to prevent the player's thumb from, slipping forward in use. 

 The thumb rest could be integrally formed with the handle of the bat as a solid projection. However, it is preferred for the thumb rest to be movable relative to the handle of the bat, as this allows the bat to be used by different players with different preferences. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0011"> If the projection is movable, then it will move to some degree during play, as shots are made. Preferably, means are provided to return the thumb rest to a home position after movement. <sub>&gt;</sub> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0012"> Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0013"> ~ Figure 1 is a view of a standard prior art table tennis bat; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0014"> Figure 2 is a view of a first embodiment of a table tennis bat according to the invention; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0015"> Figure 3 is a side view of the thumb rest of the bat of Figure 2, taken in the direction of arrow III; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0016"> Figure 4 is a schematic view corresponding to Figure 2, showing how a player's thumb is positioned during play; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0017"> Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of a table tennis bat 10 according to the invention. As with the standard prior art bat shown in Figure 1 , the bat includes a blade 2 for hitting the ball and a handle 14 to be gripped by a player. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0018"> However, the shape of the handle 14 differs from the prior art handle 3, in that the handle 14 is provided with a projecting thumb rest 20 for positioning the player's thumb. The thumb rest projects generally perpendicular to the axis of the handle 14, and lies in generally the same plane as the edge of the blade 12, which allows the bat to be used by right-handed and left-handed players. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0019"> As shown in Figure 3, the thumb rest 20 has a generally U-shaped part 22, in order to accommodate the player's thumb. In particular, the thumb rest is positioned such that the interphalangeal joint of the thumb rests in the U-shaped part, with the distal phalange of the thumb projecting towards the blade 12 of the bat 20. When the bat 20 is gripped by a player using the shakehands grip, the handle 14 is squeezed between the thumb and the fingers. Positioning the thumb rest 20 so that the interphalangeal joint of the thumb rests in the U-shaped part 22 allows the player's thumb to bend over the rest 20, thus making the grip more secure (as shown in Figure 4, where the player's thumb 40 is shown in dotted lines) As shown in Figures 2 and 4, the thumb rest can have an additional part 24, projecting towards the blade 12 of the bat 10, for accommodating the end part of 

 the player's thumb (the distal phalange). As with part 22, the additional part 24 can be U-shaped, to better accommodate the player's thumb. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0020"> In particular, a raised lip 26 can be provided at the end of this additional part 24, which projects away from the handle 14. In use, the tip of the player's thumb comes into contact with the raised lip 26, and this prevents the player's thumb from sliding forwards oh the thumb rest 20 in use. Further, a strap formed of hook-and- eye material (such as Velcro) can be provided, to retain the user's thumb on part 24. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0021"> The thumb rest 20 can be formed integrally with the handle 14 of the bat 10, as a single solid piece. However, it is preferred for the thumb rest 20 to be formed as a separate part which is capable of movement relative to the handle 14, and the embodiment shown in Figures 2 to 4 is capable of such movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0022"> As best seen in Figure 3, a joint 28 is provided between the base of the projection 30 and the thumb rest 20, which allows movement of the thumb rest 20 relative to the base of the projection 30. In particular, the thumb rest 20 can twist relative to the base 30, which allows the player greater control of the bat 10, and can also improve the comfort. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0023"> Further, means can be provided for returning the thumb rest to its central position after it has been twisted. In the embodiment shown in Figures 2 to 4, these means take the form of resilient straps 32 which connect the lip 26 at the end of the part for accommodating the distal phalange to the sides of the handle 14. These resilient straps 32 could be formed from rubber bands, plastic strips, or any suitable material. In an alternative form, the means for returning the thumb rest to its central position could be accommodated within the thumb rest itself. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0024"> The Figures also show that the side of the handle 14 opposite to the thumb rest 20 is formed with recesses 34 for accommodating the fingers of the player's hands; however, although these recesses are preferred, they are not required, and the bat can be formed with a standard shape on the side opposite to the thumb rest: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p0025"> The projection can be formed as part of a removable sleeve which fits over the handle of a standard bat.
