They are basically only suitable for teenagers of a certain age and above. Or adults, not suitable for children who are still in high growth and development, especially for young children. Children do not meet the requirements of these ball games in terms of strength, speed, endurance, range of exercise, etc., and children's bones and muscles are relatively fragile. They are extremely vulnerable to injury in these ball games, which is rarely seen. Children participate in these ball games. Ball games suitable for children should not only consider the physical characteristics of children, but also consider the safety and entertainment of children involved in sports.</span>

 说 明 书 </span>[0005] 1. A lightweight round balloon that floats in the air and slowly descends after being inflated. According to the law of buoyancy, when the mass of a circular balloon is slightly larger than the buoyancy of the air, the circular balloon can float in the air and slowly land. Using rubber latex or similar materials as the main raw material, a well-known rotational molding process that can control the size and quality of the ball is used to obtain a lightweight round balloon with a charge and discharge valve that can float in the air and slowly land. A lightweight round balloon that can float in the air and slowly land in the air after inflation has these movement characteristics: the ball can be thrown or shot with less force; the air resistance is obvious during operation, and the running speed is higher. Slow, the range of motion is small. These sporting features of lightweight round balloons can effectively meet the requirements of children's ball sports in terms of physical strength, speed, endurance and range of motion. Due to the different parts and angles, the lightweight round balloon can rotate and form a straight or arc parabolic motion path, which can be used by two or more people to ensure the entertainment of the ball. Round balloons made of rubber latex or similar materials are highly flexible and skin-friendly. When children are hit by these balloons, they will not be harmed, ensuring children's safety during exercise. Lightweight round balloons can be inflated from 3" to 36" in diameter and weigh between 0.8 and 48 grams. Lightweight round balloons of different sizes and weights are available for children of all ages.  Instruction manual</span>
